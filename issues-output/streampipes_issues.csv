thanks for asking!
StreamSets is a great tool as well, but there are some conceptual/technical differences and also differences concerning the purpose and target audience between StreamPipes and StreamSets.

First of all, StreamSets is primarily focused on continuous data harmonization targeting users with a data engineering focus. In contrast, the main goal of StreamPipes is to support non-technical people, e.g., production experts in designing data analytics pipelines. Many users use StreamPipes for (often stateful) tasks such as condition monitoring, situation detection or IoT analytics. A main focus of StreamPipes is to provide real-time analytics based on reusable pipeline elements, for example, to monitor a production plant. Of course, the rather generic architecture of StreamPipes allows for other use cases and also data harmonization tasks (we also provide features like field renaming or hashing), but you won't find pipeline elements that can be configured on a rather technical level as it is possible with StreamSets. While most data sinks in StreamSets are third party applications where you'd like to route data to, sinks in StreamPipes are often also things like visualizations, notifications or web services connected to actuators.

From a technical perspective, StreamPipes uses the concept of runtime wrappers. Those wrappers can be used to extend the functionality of StreamPipes with new algorithms in the form of pipeline elements (which are standalone elements that connect to the editor using REST interfaces and exchange data using message brokers/protocols like Kafka or MQTT).  Currently we have wrappers for Flink, Spark, Kafka Streams, Java, and Siddhi (although some of them are not yet fully ready for production usage). Wrappers can be extended for any kind of data processing technology to ensure to keep up to with the fast-changing ecosystem of stream processors. 

In addition, a major benefit of StreamPipes (in our opinion) are advanced matching features provided to users when building pipelines by employing semantics-based consistency checking. Each of the pipeline elements and data sources can be enriched with semantic metadata, which is used by StreamPipes to ensure that only semantically correct pipelines are built (e.g., you can add requirements for a minimum frequency of events in a stream or require that an event provides some ""temperature"" value that measures temperature in the unit ""degree celsius"". The system supports users during the definition of pipelines by recommending processors and also helps to avoid building inconsistent pipelines. Such semantic descriptions can be easily added using the SDK. In addition, we are currently working on the release of a graphical model editor that is connected to a code generator in the backend.

Although StreamPipes can be used for data routing and transformation tasks, we mainly focus on generating value out of raw, continuous, preferably sensor/time-series data by enabling non-technical users to build data pipelines.

Having said that, since both StreamPipes and StreamSets have been developed over the last couple of years, there is clearly some overlap regarding the overall idea and some data processors that are provided by both tools.

We hope that answers your question! If you have any feedback, feature suggestions or things you'd like to see in StreamPipes, please let us know (and feel free to contact us directly on our mailing list or slack (streampipes-community.slack.com)!

I could see companies using StreamSets for this as well. I know at least one client using it for IoT already.

I assume you are referring to the [Groovy Evaluator](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/3.4.0/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Processors/Groovy.html) here?

> sinks ... are often also things like visualizations, notifications or web services ...

This would using some combination of HTTP / REST / Kafka / MQTT / other, I assume. Not sure if ""connected to actuators"" really is a critical detail for differentiating the product offerings. 

> Currently we have wrappers for Flink, Spark, Kafka Streams, Java, and Siddhi

I didn't dig too far into the documentation, but does this mean an API layer for these tools that you call out to make a request to a ""StreamPipes API"", or that you can say ""run StreamPipes pipelines within these tools""; basically, like an ""embedded mode""?

thanks! 

>  It would be useful if you could add such differentiators on your site so that other's won't be wondering as well. 

That's a good idea, we are currently in the process of releasing a new version next week and will then also work on an updated documentation. We'll add a section to our FAQ that compares StreamPipes to other products (actually, we are also often asked for the difference to NodeRed).

> This would using some combination of HTTP / REST / Kafka / MQTT / other, I assume. Not sure if ""connected to actuators"" really is a critical detail for differentiating the product offerings.

Yes, often some of these protocols are used for connecting sinks to things wenn we connect to actuators or third-party systems. The main idea is that we try to abstract from those technical details for the end user (e.g., by providing an ""alarm light"" sink that triggers the alarm at some machine or so...)

> to make a request to a ""StreamPipes API"", or that you can say ""run StreamPipes pipelines within these tools""; basically, like an ""embedded mode""?

You can think of a pipeline element as a self-contained component that exposes its description as a JSON-LD graph via REST. In addition, a pipeline element implements its processing logic using one of the wrappers. Once a pipeline is started, StreamPipes invokes a pipeline element (again using a JSON-LD graph that now includes information on the data sources to connect to, the broker/topic where results should be sent to and other information such as user-provided parameters). Afterwards, the pipeline element itself executes the processing logic based on this configuration. Wrappers that rely on a distributed system (e.g., Flink), submit the processing logic to the configured cluster. At runtime, pipeline elements communicate with each other by using a message broker (usually Kafka, but other brokers could be used as well). One advantage of this architecture is that geographically distributed pipelines can be built (e.g., some pipeline elements are deployed at the edge and some others run centrally in some cloud).

Hope that helps! Don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions and we really appreciate your feedback!

Based on your feedback, we've implemented a feature that provides interactive hints on pipeline validation errors such as missing sinks or multiple independent pipelines in the assembly (see the screenshot below). This should improve the user guidance while creating pipelines.

DataSphere Studio is a one-stop data application development and management portal open source by WeBank, which meets the needs of the entire process of data application development from data exchange, desensitization and cleaning, analysis and mining, quality inspection, visual display, regular scheduling to data output.

In future enhancements, we plan to introduce features that require actions at pipeline creation time, e.g., to create a virtual data stream once a pipeline is stored. To avoid installing/deinstalling such a stream at every start/stop of a pipeline, the wrapper interfaces should be extended/refactored as follows:
 * Add an onPipelineStored method to the pipeline element definition
 * Add an onPipelineDeleted method to the pipeline element definition
 * Rename onInvocation to onPipelineStarted and onDetach to onPipelineStopped for clarifying the scope of the provided methods
 * Ensure backwards compatibility by introducing API versioning for pipeline element endpoints

It seems to me that the create table statement is used on each event (onEvent-method) and not in the onInvocation method.


The table is created and can't be created again because the name is already used.
So no data is stored at the moment in the sink.

 Table 'testtable' was unexpectedly not found and gets recreated.
 ERROR: column ""randomText"" of relation ""testtable"" does not exist

So the first message is a little bit misleading, because the table
exists but can't be found and will be recreated in an endless loop.

The reason is because this statement during the
generatePreparedStatement method:


```

	INSERT INTO testschema.testtable ( ""randomText"", ""randomNumber"", ""count"", ""timestamp"" ) VALUES ( 'c',
69, 83531, 1591611708415 );

```


The problem here is that postgres uses lowercases for the column names.
So instead of randomText then name has to be randomtext:

```

	INSERT INTO testschema.testtable ( ""randomtext"", ""randomnumber"", ""count"", ""timestamp"" ) VALUES ( 'c',
69, 83531, 1591611708415 )

```

Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. StreamPipes offers several modules including StreamPipes Connect to easily connect data from industrial IoT sources, the Pipeline Editor to quickly create processing pipelines and several visualization modules for live and historic data exploration. Under the hood, StreamPipes utilizes an event-driven microservice paradigm of standalone, so-called analytics microservices making the system easy to extend for individual needs.

 

*Background*

Current wrappers such as standalone (JVM, Siddhi) or distributed (Flink) already allow to develop new processors in the given runtime environment. The idea is to extend the list of standalone runtime wrappers to also support pure Python processors. We already got a minimal working version that however is pretty inflexible and still relies on Java as a proxy to the pipeline management in the backend service for the model declaration in the setup phase ( capabilities, requirements, static properties of a processor) as well as the actual invocation in the execution phase ( receiving specific configuration from pipeline management when pipeline is started). This issue is to track the status of the development.

 

*Tasks*
 - Add API endpoints as an interface for registration/invocation ( partly done)
 - Port relevant model classes over to Python (declaration **** invocation descriptions)
 - Implement support for various transport protocols and transport formats
 - Implement dev friendly alternative to Java builder pattern for model declaration 
 - Implement overall runtime logic for Python wrapper

 

*Relevant Skills*

0. Don't be afraid! We'll guide you through your first steps with StreamPipes.
 - Excellent Python skills
 - Excellent understanding of stream processing paradigm incl.  message broker such as Kafka, MQTT, etc
 - Good Understanding of RESTful web services (HTTP, etc.)
 - Basic Java skills to understand existing wrapper logic

 

*Info*
 * SIP-02 to collect design decisions https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STREAMPIPES/SIP-02****Python****wrapper 
 * Current python runtime wrapper implementation: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-wrapper-python](https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-wrapper-python)

2) [https://superset.apache.org/](https://superset.apache.org/)
 
Especially to make Apache StreamPipes more attractive for Endusers the Dashboard Functionality is Key. 
 
At the current state there will be most of all a comparison between Node-Red and Apache StreamPipes. In my humble opinion a key differentiator is the easy way to generate dashboards and diagrams basically out of the box. If we could manage to e.g. integrate Apache ECharts with Apache StreamPipes this could be a game changer. Especially when you look at standard commercial products which basically have a lack of automatically showing stuff as easy as StreamPipes is already capable of doing.

Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. StreamPipes offers several modules including StreamPipes Connect to easily connect data from industrial IoT sources, the Pipeline Editor to quickly create processing pipelines and several visualization modules for live and historic data exploration. Under the hood, StreamPipes utilizes an event-driven microservice paradigm of standalone, so-called analytics microservices making the system easy to extend for individual needs.

 

*Background*

For processing event streams, StreamPipes utilizes a wrapper concept which delegates event processing to an underlying engine. Currently, various wrappers exist (having a more or less mature state) for plain JVM execution, Siddhi, Kafka Streams and Flink. The goal of this task is to develop a wrapper for JavaScript. This includes extending an existing JavaScript-based SDK to allow users to write data processors and data sinks in JavaScript.

 

*Tasks*
 - Extend the existing JavaScript SDK so that data processors and data sinks can be created and integrated into StreamPipes
 - Develop the runtime layer to process events in JavaScript.
 - Write a few sample processors or sinks using your new wrapper!

 

*Relevant Skills*

Visualizations can be flexibly created by users and there is an SDK that allows to express requirements (e.g., based on data type or semantic type) for visualizations to better guide users through the creation process.

 

*Tasks*
 - Extend the set of real-time visualizations in StreamPipes, e.g., by integrating existing visualizations from Apache ECharts.
 - Improve the existing dashboard, e.g., by introducing better filtering or more advanced customization options.

Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. StreamPipes offers several modules including StreamPipes Connect to easily connect data from industrial IoT sources, the Pipeline Editor to quickly create processing pipelines and several visualization modules for live and historic data exploration. Under the hood, StreamPipes utilizes an event-driven microservice paradigm of standalone, so-called analytics microservices making the system easy to extend for individual needs.
### *****Background*****

Currently, window logic can be individually defined per pipeline element. The whole windowing logic needs to be declared in the controller and runtime logic needs to be individually added based on the selected runtime wrapper (Java, Siddhi, Flink, etc...).

As many data processors benefit from using window-functions (i.e PEs such as Event Counter, Count Aggregation, Rate Limiter), windowing logic is often duplicated as it needs to be implemented for every new pipeline element. In addition, the feature set of supported window operators differs (and often depends on the developer) as it is unclear which windows and parameters should/can be offered.  

Therefore, adding support for explicit window semantics to the SDK/Core would make implementing data processors and sinks using windows much easier and less error-prone.
### *****Tasks*****
 - Design and introduce new processor and controller classes for windowed event processors (e.g., WindowedDataProcessor) which handle the windowing logic internally and only expose the higher-level methods to users (i.e onCurrentEvent, onExpiredEvent, etc...).
 - Implement internal logic for few window functions (i.e TimeWindow, LengthWindow, TimeBatchWindow, LengthBatchWindow, etc...)
 - Write a few sample pipeline-elements using your new API!

### *****Relevant Skills*****
 * Basic knowledge in StreamPipes core (cloning the repo, going through the codebase/documents would do).
 * Basic knowledge of stream analytics window functions (this is not a must, but it's awesome if you know your way around analytics window functions).
 * Some Java experience.

Seems like the backend is misconfigured to use ""http://connect-worker-main:8098"" instead of ""http://connect-worker:8098"", because the name k8s svc name is ""connect-worker"". So either the backend needs to be updated or the k8s svc name needs to be changed.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Deploy StreamPipes on k8s.
2) Open UI \> Connect \> Apache Kafka
3) Enter kafka host and port.
When its searching for kafka topics, check logs of backend.

*Use case:*

1) Run a pipeline with two flink PE's.

2) Go to flink dashboard and cancel one of the flink job (i.e. PE)

3) Go to streampipes UI and try to stop the pipeline.

4) It fails to stop the pipeline completely because of the missing PE.

5) The other PE's are stopped now, but the pipeline is still shown as running.

 

*Expected behaviour:*

If the flink job is not found, then it means that it is cancelled or failed. So streampipes should continue to stop this PE from its in-memory storage and mark the whole pipeline as Stopped.

 

See the attached screenshots!

When the node is not directly read, eclipse milo returns `BaseDataVariableType` as data type for all nodes. Accordingly, all nodes are assigned to be strings.

 

*Solution*

Retrieve the data type for all nodes individually from the server, but only in case a node with multiple sub-nodes is accessed.

Debugging of pipelines during creation is important from a user perspective. Currently, the only way to debug a pipeline is to add multiple dashboard nodes, go to the dashboard, view results and modify the pipeline.

The preview needs to limit the number of events shown so that the browser does not get overloaded with high-frequency streams.

Rename multiple events field at once.
```

{
  ""time_stamp"": 1234,
  ""sensor_id"": ""sensor1"",
  ""sensor_measurement"": 24.0
}

```

```

{
  ""time_stamp"": 1234,
  ""id"": ""sensor1"",
  ""measurement"": 24.0
}

 *Problem*

Currently, we do have a FieldRenamer implemented using Flink wrapper, yet only allowing to rename one field at a time, i.e., renaming n fields requires a sequence of #n FieldRenamer processors. In addition, this option is unavailable when using lite version, i.e., standalone Java extensions.

*Solution*

Add FieldRenamer JVM processor using something like CollectionStaticProperty to allow arbitrary number of mappings, where a user can select a mapping property and add a new field name in a text field right next to it.

 

[EDIT]: There is a duplicate https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STREAMPIPES-338 

While this allows to rename single fields, it still does not support multi field renaming in one step.

streampipes-container-embedded

This can be simplified so that it is much more clearer for new contributors to know where to find pieces of code:
 
* Rename container modules to ""service"" to indicate that these modules are services:
streampipes-service-base
streampipes-service-core

* Manage rest interfaces in rest modules:

- [x] Move API from streampipes-container to streampipes-extensions-api


### Breaking Changes:
- Modules and packages have been renamed. For pipeline elements that are developed outside of StreamPipes using the SDK, imports need to be updated in data processor and sink definitions, adapters and the `ServiceDefinitionBuilder`. No further code changes are necessary besides updating package names.

the CLI provides the feature to print logs of containers defined in the current env. 

`streampipes logs `

I like the _\--follow_ option to get a general idea what's happening... 

The _\--follow_ option requires the name of the service I want to watch, but sometimes I don't want to watch a specific container but all.

 What do you think of the idea to make the service name optional? 

A command would look like this: _streampipes logs -f_

we are running streampipes Version 0.68 inside kubernetes. At the moment we have the problem that if a mqtt adapter is created after clicking on ""Start adapter"" the message ""Please wait while your adapter is generated"" keeps spinning. If I look at the requests in the browser I can see that there is a 500 error. 

If I open then streampipes in a new window under connect/adapters I can see the adapter but it is not shown in the pipeline editor.

In the logs of the backend pod I see this 500 error. What can be the cause of this?

if I create a processor with streampipes-archetype-extensions-jvm I get a message [1]

""APPLICATION FAILED TO START ... The following method did not exist: ... setApplicationStartup(Lorg/springframework/core/metrics/ApplicationStartup;)V""

  
One solution is to add: 
        <dependency\>
            <groupId\>org.springframework</groupId\>
            <artifactId\>spring-context-support</artifactId\>
            <version\>${spring.version}</version\>
        </dependency\>

Is this a good solution?
If yes, should it be placed in the archetype pom or streampipes-container-base?

streampipes-container-base has the variable spring.version

I am using npm version 7.5.2 and was thinking about rolling back to v6 but wanted to check to see if I am doing something wrong.

I also started to manually go through and update dependencies but wasn't sure if there was a reason to hold certain packages back?

Therefore, the URL of the core is retrieved via Consul which points to the core container IP address (commonly ""http://172.x.x.x:8030"") which can't be resolved from the local IDE environment.

*Option A*

Adapter developers can manipulate the docker-compose description of the backend service by adding an ""SP_HOST"" environment variable with their local machine's IP address. Thereby, the core of StreamPipes registers under this IP at Consul which can be resolved from the local IDE, e.g., with the URL ""http://192.x.x.x:8030"".

*Option B*

Adapter developers can simply use the ""SP_DEBUG=true"" environment variable in the run configuration of a connect adapter service to remap the retrieved URL from ""http://172.x.x.x:8030"" to ""http://localhost:8030"". 

 

Note: this allows applies for hybrid service definitions containing, e.g., extensions-all-jvm, as it contains adapter services that currently try to actively register at the core.

One of our MQTT Adapters we use as a data source for one of our production pipelines stopped delivering data. After checking the logs (see below) it was found that the MQTT client was unable to connect to the broker on account of an authorization problem.

After double-checking that the credentials did not change (via an MQTT command line client), the pipeline was stopped and the adapter restarted. This did not solve the issue. Checking the logs verified that the same error occurred.
- Extra Info

We have had a couple of Kubernetes Node problems lately which might have randomly deleted / rescheduled Pods onto other Nodes.

https://lists.apache.org/thread/vrl71vl41bygs9n00sx6j31dmwn5r6n9

new structure with more subfolders
add descriptions and  examples for adapter
reorganize pipeline elements
add description and example for sinks

```


First Idea of Structure

    • Introduction:
        ◦ Overview
        ◦ Basic Elements (former
StreamPipes Concept)
        ◦ Time in StreamPipes (Why timestamp is important in the data?)
    
   ◦ Semantic in StreamPipes
        ◦ Other Topics?
        ◦ Installation
            ▪ Basic Installation

           ▪ Docker Deployment
            ▪ K8s / K3s
            ▪ Use SSL
            ▪ Security

       ◦ Getting Help
    • Overview (Basic GUI Explanation and Introduction for each GUI point and
why it is  implemented  (short description text) for example Dashboard why Dashboard, what you can do.
Basically little more deep diver than Basic Elements section. Section with Most of the Screenshots,
So easy to maintain due changes)
        ◦ Login Page and Basics
        ◦ Welcome Page
        ◦
Pipelines
        ◦ Connect
        ◦ Dashboard
        ◦ Data Explorer
        ◦ Apps (deprecated?)

       ◦ Install Pipeline Elements
        ◦ Asset Management
        ◦ File Management
        ◦
Configuration & User Prefences
        ◦ Notification
    • Data Source Elements
        ◦ Why Adapter.
Connect to the Real World
        ◦ What Kind of Sources (Data Set vs Data Stream / Categories)
 
      ◦ Basic Adapter Setup in 4 Steps (at the moment)
            ▪ Step 1 Settings
            ▪
Step 2 Select Format
                • JSON with Description for Array Field / GeoJSON / Single Object
/ Array with Short Data Examples
                • XML
                • CSV
                • Image

           ▪ Step 3 configure fields
                • Different between  Measurement, Dimension Header

               • Add Nested / Add static Value / Add Timestamp
                • Edit fields (Big Thinks.
Also)
                • Preview
            ▪ Step4 start adapters
                • Settings / Description
(why Important and where can I find this info later on?)
                • Remove Duplicates / Reduce
event rates /Persist events
        ◦ Connect Adapters IIOT Overview 
            ▪ Apache Kafka with
Example Sources
            ▪ Apache Pulsar
            ▪ File Set
            ▪ File Stream
  
         ▪ ...
        ◦ Connect Adapters Overview
        ◦ • ...
        ◦ How To Adapter
   
        ▪ Setup Adapter Example 1
            ▪ Setup HTTPS Adapter
        ◦ Technical Concept of
Adapters (Dev Part???)
    • Data Processors
    • Data Sinks
    • Create Pipeline
    • Dashboard

   • Assets

Further, when a large data set is exported often new lines are inserted. This is especially problematic, when a user tries to re-import the file in an adapter.

Especially if the producer of the source configuration and user of the source are different people.

E.g. For MQTT and Kafka sources it could be useful to know the broker and topic.

 

What do you think about an additional tab in the editor/dialog/help.component with some technical information of the related data source.

Something like this:

  REST-Client

    URL

 * The state is not persisted when an adapter is restarted
 * No option to ignore the timestamp field

### New functionality
 * A user should be able to add the remove duplicate rule with the option to ignore the timestamp field.
 * A user should be able to restart an adapter without loosing the state of the remove duplicate rule

### Info
 * To do that we need to extend the API of adapters and add the functionality to execute code when an adapter is stopped
 * An API to load data (on startup) and persist (on shutdown) for elements is required

was there a specific reason why you changed the method API of `Event.addField(String runtimeName, Float value)` to `Event.addField(String runtimeName, double value)`?
The nightly e2e tests failed for the `BooleanCounter` processor, because the datatype of the counter (an integer) was changed to a double. I changed the API back to `Float` but wanted to make sure that this does not break any of the other changes you made in the PR.
Cheers,
Philipp

First of all you need to setup StreamPipes locally in that way that you can develop the UI. Have a look at this [documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STREAMPIPES/UI).

The gif below demonstrates the described issue:
![missing-api-token-name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50115603/209471829-6297ee1a-668f-45fd-8786-cc4e9c6233cc.gif)


Empty names for API tokens should be avoided, therefore we need a validator here.
The corresponding Angular component can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/c0c2a6e9862fcce6150340aafb86b1d66c08ff3c/ui/src/app/profile/components/token).

Hopefully, this provides you with enough information to start. Otherwise, just let me know.

I couldn't find a validator in the code, but here is a tutorial on typed reactive forms [1].
It also includes a regex validator. Since you are new to Anular, I would recommend trying the tutorial first.
It is quite short and provides a good introduction.

accuracy compared to qgis is totally acceptable within 0.01 tolerance

- Goal:
Essential Task in Geo is to reproject between different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)
e.g for special calculations which needs meter as CRS Unit instead of degree (as it it in WGS84)

- Libs and Sources:
Lib for reprojection would be
https://sis.apache.org/

fallback:
https://github.com/locationtech/proj4j

Necessary extra package is the EPSG Library Source, which needs a special license agreement (not apache license).
User Downloads the Postgres SQL Scripts here: https://epsg.org/auth/Account/Login
During registration User agrees to license, so it can be used in StreamPipes.

- 
- Following Workflow (to be discussed)
The User unzipped the Scripts and but them into a specific folder.
Then StreamPipes can start the docker-compose file and here the questions occurs.
how to implement the service and where
What happens if files are missing
Where to register the connectionSource and how to validate?

What happens if setup fails. Are geo processors active or special Exceptions during Pipeline Creation?

Next, we are interested in the fields of the input event stream that contains the latitude and longitude value we would like to compute against the geofence center location as follows:

```

String latitudeFieldName = extractor.mappingPropertyValue(""latitude-field"");
String longitudeFieldName
= extractor.mappingPropertyValue(""longitude-field"");

```



1) Shouldn't it be:
```

String latitudeFieldName = parameters.extractor().mappingPropertyValue(""latitude-field"");
String longitudeFieldName
= parameters.extractor().mappingPropertyValue(""longitude-field"");

```



2) But this code snippet is  is missing in ""Your controller class should look as follows"" example.

3) The latitudeFieldName is used in the onEvent Method as
```

float latitude = event.getFieldBySelector(latitudeFieldName).getAsPrimitive().getAsFloat();
float
longitude = event.getFieldBySelector(longitudeFieldName).getAsPrimitive().getAsFloat();

```

But the variables can not be resolved.

Currently, the default internal messaging system relies on Kafka/Zookeeper.
To provide a more lightweight installation option, StreamPipes also works with Nats or MQTT.
Until a migration script is ready to completely switch from Kafka to Nats, provide installation files so that users can select from the various options.

This is the issue to track the progress of check-style enablement for all modules. 
If you want to take over some of the modules, please feel free to leave a comment here. And thanks for all your contribution!  :smiley:

Only the first level of sub-modules are listed here. If you feel that some of the modules(eg. `streampipes-extensions`) are heavy, please continue to split them into smaller tasks in this issue.

### Affected StreamPipes components

Backend, Connect, Processing Elements, UI

### What happened?

Some of my JSON data consumed by an input adapter have null values.
 E.g. {""name"": 1, ""age"": null}

This leads to a NPE when guessing the schema. 

In my local SP version I just replaced the null value after parsing with a java.util.Optional and a custom runtime type.
This works most of the time especially if the field datatype is string.

But I think this is not a complete solution since the behavior in processors and output adapters is not defined.

What do you think how this kind of data should be handed?

thanks for opening the Issue.
I think this is a great question. I guess we have to destiguish between the 'guess schema' phase and 'runtime' phase:
- Guess schema:
  - If a value is null we have the problem that the data type can not be inferred. So I would say we have two options, either remove the property, or notify the user to select a data type manually. (I think I would prefer the second option, because the user can decide what should happen. This would require changes in the API and the UI)
- Runtime:
  - Here I see three options to deal with missing data. Either remove the whole event, remove the missing value or provide a default value. I would prefere the second option. We recently implemented something similar for the data lake. The problem with this solution is that processing elements expect that events are complete (have values for all properties). If we start to remove property values from events, then we need a mechanism to deal with incomplete events. Therefore, we have to adapt the API for processing elements.

thank you for the classification and the interesting thoughts.

 * Related to the guess schema topic I prefer the second version too.  
    This raises interesting questions related to the runtime part.
* Related to the runtime topic I like the second option too but have no clear idea how to handle the missing values.  
    I did some experiments with a custom processor and realized that some of my external systems require all properties of the json object. In this case I could reconstruct the null values from the schema.?. 
    If properties are removed at runtime an extensions of the output adapters could be useful which adds the missing values for external systems which need this properties.

  Because of this two problems I came up with “default value” (Optional value) solution.
  But I am not sure what good default values could be especially if they should be ignored in the processing.
  Using an optional attribute (Which seems to exists in the schema!?) seems to me a promising but seems to have many implications. Checks in the processing components handling in the semantic layer … 

What do you think about this ideas?

I think this raises the question how want to handle null values in general, doesn't it?

Thanks a lot @tenthe for sketching some concepts to tackle this problem already.
In terms of the schema guessing part, I agree with you both that option two is the cleanest option and also my preferred one.
In that sense, I would prefer (speaking from an user or high level perspective) the third option (providing a default value) at runtime. After all, if we are already asking the user to choose the correct data type, we should go that route completely and handle null values correctly. If we don't want to do that, we could just go with option one for schema guessing, imho.
That being said, this issue gets somehow a larger one right?
So I would suggest to create a discussion where we can brainstorm how we solve this technically.

@obermeier I also like the idea of optional values. But as you stated this has multiple implications that we should discuss.
I a m not sure if we support this already in the event schema. There is a field `required` in the class `EventProperty` but I do not know if we can use this field for this purpose or if we need a new attribute for that.

If checkboxes are used in issue templates (like this one), they are recognized as tasks by Github.
This is unintentionally and creates some confusion, therefore we should replace checkboxes in our issue templates by dropdown menus.

Currently, there is no PR validation workflow in place for the `streampipes-website` repository.
As a firs iteration, we could create a workflow that builds both the website and the documentation.
This would help us to evaluate PR more easily and is of great help for dependency updates especially.

welcome to StreamPipes, great to hear that you want to contribute 🎉 

This issue depends on #876 and therefore it's preferable to have this PR merged before starting to work on this issue.
I expect this to happen in the upcoming days.

Nevertheless, I'll give a quick wrap up what to do:
1. Choose one of the UI models listed above and remove them from `ui/.eslintignore` and `ui/.prettierignore` locally
2. Run the UI commit hook like described in the [README](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/ui/README.md)
3. Fix the detected issues automatically (see README) or by hand
4. create a PR with your changes

In case you already want to contribute, feel free to have a look on our other issues.

Not at once but in the end, yes. The idea is to remove them step by step. So in best case you only remove one module from both files, run the tools and check where things need to adapted.
You can provide one PR per module or group more modules in one but please ensure that PRs don't get to big.

Upon performing linting, I came a warning and few errors.

Warning:

```
D:\root\Code\Open source\streampipes\ui\src\app\app-asset-monitoring\dialog\add-pipeline\add-pipeline-dialog.component.ts
  78:5  warning  Lifecycle interface 'OnInit' should be implemented for method 'ngOnInit'. (https://angular.io/styleguide#style-09-01)  @angular-eslint/use-lifecycle-interface
```

I fixed the above warning by implementing OnInit interface on AddPipelineDialogComponent.

`export class AddPipelineDialogComponent implements OnInit`

That fixed the warning.

Also I came across few errors which occurs in multiple files and I'll be listing them below:

```
D:\root\Code\Open source\streampipes\ui\src\app\configuration\consul-configs\consul-configs.component.html
  37:51  error  Expected `===` but received `==`  @angular-eslint/template/eqeqeq
```

For the above error, I have replaced ""=="" with ""==="", for all the respected files, and that fixed the error.

```

I'm not sure about the above error.

Regarding the last point, I agree with @bossenti. You can remove such empty methods.

In general, we should add `implements` when a component implements a lifecycle hook. If the method is empty, we can safely delete it.

Upon performing linting, I came across a few errors.

Error:

```
streampipes\ui\src\app\core\components\base-navigation.component.ts
  28:5  error  Type boolean trivially inferred from a boolean literal, remove type annotation  @typescript-eslint/no-inferrable-types
```

`authenticated: boolean = true;`

For the above error, we need to remove either `boolean` or `true`. My question is, which one should we remove?

Error:

```
streampipes\ui\src\app\core\components\iconbar\iconbar.component.ts
  30:15  error  The selector should be kebab-case (https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-05-02)  @angular-eslint/component-selector
```

`selector: 'iconbar',` or `streampipes` or `toolbar`

For the above error, the selector should be in `kebab-case`, which means that it should use all lowercase letters and separate words with a hyphen. Also, we have to apply the `sp` prefix, and after, it would look like this: `sp-icon-bar`

The component would be like this:

```
@Component({
    selector: 'sp-icon-bar',
    templateUrl: './iconbar.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./iconbar.component.scss'],
})
```

My question is: After applying `kebab-case` and `sp` prefix to the selector, shouldn't we also apply the `kebab-case` to `templateUrl` and `styleUrls` or is it not required?

like:

```
@Component({
    selector: 'sp-tool-bar',

### What do you want to report?

README.md subscription mailing list link (line number: 203) redirects to relative path.

Create a branch, we don't have strict naming conventions here but it would be awesome if you could include the GitHub id of this issue (#878) in both the branch name and the commit messages.
After that you can simply apply your changes and create a PR, we will then have a look on it.

Actually, I never did anything related to git commit management. So I would be happy to see an example of a pre-commit hook if there are any in the project.

You could for example write a bash file that should be executed when comitting.

For StreamPipes we have commit hooks at two places already present. The first one is for the UI codebase, it was contributed in #875 
The second one is used in our python module (`streampipes-client-python`) where we use the `pre-commit` library: https://pre-commit.com/

We also have a short description in our wiki how to do it [1].
You can find the checkstyle file in [2].
My suggestion would be to add checkstyle in your local development environment first. 
To test that everythinf is setup correctly, you can fix the checkstyle violations in #1192.

To ensure that there are no checkstyle violations we use a GitHub action. This is also the reason why the build in #1192 failed. To give the developer an even quicker feedback we want to integrate this check as a git pre-commit hook. That means a developer can only perform a git commit when there are no checkstyle violations.

I didn't do something like this before, but I guess we can also use the library https://pre-commit.com/ for that.

@bossenti: Do you think we should harmonize the tools we use for the hooks? Is it possible to use pre-commit for all the different languages? (For Typescript we use [3])

A user should have the configuration possibility to use the timestamp of the OPC UA Server as event time.
Currently the timestamp has to be added in the schema editor by clicking **Add timestamp**. 
With this option, the adapter will add a timestamp, but this might differ from the original time of the data source.

Upgrade to the most recent Angular version (`v15`).
This includes probably some manual code adaptions.
Furthermore, all dependencies related to Angular should also be updated.

Currently, the location of Consul to register services needs to be provided by a CONSUL_LOCATION env variable, which is defined in each Dockerfile for production usage and can be manually overridden. CONSUL_LOCATION implicitly requires the hostname and not the complete URL which might cause confusion.

* Introduce two new environment variables SP_CONSUL_HOST and SP_CONSUL_PORT
* Deprecate CONSUL_LOCATION
* Remove CONSUL_LOCATION env variable declaration from all Dockerfiles and use ""consul"" as default SP_CONSUL_HOST value 
* Use ""localhost"" as SP_CONSUL_HOST default if SP_DEBUG is set to true

On the login page we have a link to the API documentation. An e2e test should check if this link works and the documentation is displayed correctly.
 
For e2e tests we use cypress [1], the documentation and a good introduction can be found on their website. 
All e2e tests are in [2], this folder also contains a readme file that explains how to run the test locally.

To solve this issue, create a new directory in [3] called `apiDocumentation` and add a new test file. 
This test will then automatically be displayed in the Cypress user interface.
A good example test to get started can be found in [4]. This test is used to verify that the user interface login works correctly.

The `StandaloneModelSubmitter` has been deprecated and should be replaced by`ExtensionsModelSubmitter`.
We can get rid of the whole module `streampipes-container-standalone` by having all extensions services support connect adapters + pipeline elements, which simplifies the codebase and improves developer experience.

### Breaking Changes:
- The StandaloneModelSubmitter is removed, please use [ExtensionsModelSubmitter](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/5dfc5b3c729b3e221be44acc4df3e87d6cccd7d9/streampipes-container-extensions/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/container/extensions/ExtensionsModelSubmitter.java#L41) instead

great that you are interested in contributing to StreamPipes 🚀 
Here is one of the examples given in the pydocs:
```python
Examples
--------

>>> from streampipes_client.client import StreamPipesClient
>>> from streampipes_client.client.client_config import StreamPipesClientConfig
>>> from streampipes_client.client.credential_provider import StreamPipesApiKeyCredentials

>>> client_config = StreamPipesClientConfig(
...     credential_provider=StreamPipesApiKeyCredentials(
...         username=""test-user"",
...         api_key=""api-key""
...     ),
...     host_address=""localhost"",
...     https_disabled=True
... )

>>> client = StreamPipesClient.create(client_config=client_config)

# The above way of instantiating a client instance is intended
# to be consistent with the StreamPipes Java client.
# If you prefer a more pythonic way, you can simply write:
>>> client = StreamPipesClient(client_config=client_config)

# Interact with an endpoint
>>> data_lake_measures = client.dataLakeMeasureApi.all()

# Inspect returned data as a pandas dataframe
>>> data_lake_measures.to_pandas()

    measure_name timestamp_field  ... pipeline_is_running num_event_properties
0           test   s0::timestamp  ...               False                    2
[1 rows x 6 columns]
```
Would be great if the whole code snippet would be rendered correctly in the docs.
Please note our `make` commands for building the docs conventiently: `make doc` and `make livedoc` (see also [here](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-client-python/Makefile))

Thank you for responding. I would like to know how I can replicate and work
on the issue. I've tried cloning the project but I can't seem to get the
software running or open the docs.

In the mean time, would something like adding # # or \# work?

Thanks.

Then you can follow this steps:

1. go to `/streampipes/streampipes-client-python`
2. run `pip install "".[docs]""` to install the requirements for the docs ( as far as I know you can leave out the `""` in case you are on windows
3. run `make livedoc` to get the live docs served on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
4. In case `make` does not work for you, run the following commands:
```bash
mkdocs build
mkdocs serve --dirtyreload
```
Does that work for you?

Yes, or maybe just leave the `#` out... Feel free to try a few combinations if you want to :) 

PS: I've assigned the ticket to you to indicate that you are on it
Thanks for your interest so far 👍🏼

With the current setup, inherited methods and their docstrings are unfortunately not displayed in the references of our Python client documentation. This should be the case since we use inheritance a lot here and want to provide the information at the right and intuitive place.

When using the CLI installer's command `streampipes env --set xy` the cli returns a success log message even if some error occurred and the command is not executed successfully.
For example:
```bash
./streampipes env --set ui
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
[INFO] Set environment to 'ui'
```
In case of an error, the command should exit and create a proper console output.
This might also effect other commands of the cli installer.

Clean up module `streampipes-rest-shared`.
- The interface `NoAuthenticationRequired` does not seem to be used anywhere. Can we remove it?
- Tha package `.api` contains one interface `CRUDResource` that is not used anywhere. Can we remove it?
- Class `SpMediaType` 
  - Contains the type `JSONLD`, can we remove this? It is only used in one API and I guess that is legacy code that we do not need anymore.
  - Then this class will only contain one variable `APPLICATION_ZIP` that is used. Can we move this to remove the class?

In general this seems to be a rather small module. Can we move the packages to somewhere else or should we wait till we start refactor the REST API modules?

What do you think about this: (before I create a special discussion)
Is it possible to create and use RUNTIME_names that are used more often, like the vocabulary list, globally somewhere?
Instead of define it in each processor class it is stored like Geo.LAT vocabulary  in a separate class.

```
...
private static final String GEOM_RUNTIME=""geometry""
private static final String TEMPERATUR_RUNTIME=""temperature""
...
        .outputStrategy(
            OutputStrategies.append(
                PrimitivePropertyBuilder
                    .create(Datatypes.String, GEOM_RUNTIME)
                    .domainProperty(Geo.LAT)
                    .build()
            )
...
```

It is stored in a Class Runtime
and is used like
```
        .outputStrategy(
            OutputStrategies.append(
                PrimitivePropertyBuilder
...
 ->                   .create(Datatypes.String, RUNTIME.GEOMETRY)
...
                    .build()
            )
```

Currently, we have [GitHub workflow ](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/.github/workflows/build.yml) that builds new docker images for the current code base on every push for the `dev` branch and every `release` branch.
For release branches this should stay as it is, but for our `dev` branch we should switch to a less frequent deployment mode.
I'd suggest to go with a daily build executed e.g. at `00:00 UTC`.

A generic adapter can have different formats (e.g. json, csv, ...).

The `FileStreamProtocol` can be used to replay event streams from files that are uploaded (e.g. csv file).
The protocol currently handles its own event schema and requires the `SendToBrokerReplayAdapterSink` class.
The logic of this class can be moved into the protocol so that it uses the regular connect API.

This issue should do some cleanup before we can start refactoring the connect API.

We already have a e2e test that validates that the dashboard is working, running in the smoke tests (`cypress/tests/dashboard/dashboardTest.smoke.spec.ts`).
Additionally we should add a test that validates that all different **widget types** work as expected.

My suggestion would be that we create a single pipeline in the `beforeEach` and then create a test for each widget type in a new dashboard to verify that the widget works as expected. This way the pipeline only needs to be set up once.

## List of widgets
- [ ] Area Chart
- [ ] Gauge
- [ ] Line Chart
- [ ] Raw
- [ ] Single Value
- [ ] Stacked Line Chart
- [ ] Status
- [ ] Table
- [ ] Traffic Light

I think the test itself can be quite simple and just confirm that the data is displayed, but feel free to extend it with more functionality (e.g. whether the line chart is displayed correctly). It is also possible to test multiple configurations of each widget. 
Also, we can discuss whether it is useful to also test the functionality of editing existing widgets, but I would recommend to put this in another test. 
These tests should only verify that the various widgets work as expected.

This should stay as it is, because this is the right and current logo of StreamPipes in colors.

Currently, the `PipelineExecutor` class executes several individual tasks when starting a pipeline. From the code structure, it is not clear which steps are executed when starting and stopping a pipeline.
To improve code structure, this class can be decomposed into individual tasks for each required step when executing a pipeline operation.

welcome to the StreamPipes project :)

As a first step, I would suggest that you start by setting up the development environment. 
You can find a description in [1]. 
Please let me know if you have any questions about the setup process. 

StreamPipes has two main types of services, the **service core** [2] which contains the backend of the application, and **extension services** [3]. I suggest that you first take a look at the REST API of the core service.
Here is a link to the module with all the REST endpoints [4]. You could add the endpoint described in this issue there.

Don't hesitate to write us if you have any questions.

Thanks for the guidance.
I've checked a few classes at the REST API and it seems that the method [getVersionInfo](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/6a5b00d7bf82a92a5771d2f356b9f5f6f18b1266/streampipes-rest/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/rest/impl/Version.java#L36) in ""Version"" class implements the same functionality as in the issue description.

oh yes you are right. I think we can use the existing endpoint for the functionlality described in this issue.
@bossenti what do you think? My suggestion would be to close this issue.

Another issue in the REST API to get started with, is to remove some deprecated API endpoints from the REST interface.
I'd suggest to remove all the endpoints marked with `@Deprecated(since = ""0.71.0"", forRemoval = true)`.
The first step would be to create an issue for that. Then we should check if the API is no longer used in the UI
Finally we can remove the endpoints. 
I will be happy to assist you. You can provide a PR and we can discuss the details there.

With our current [PR validation](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml) workflow all jobs for checking the PR are run no matter what changes are contained.
This results in lot of wasted runs, e.g., running the Python checks when only Java code is commited, and higher run times.
As an outcome of this issue, the individual jobs of the PR validation workflow should only be run when they are required by the changes of the underlying PR.

I think it makes sense to move the Python stuff to a dedicated workflow file. 
The dependencies were only introduced to avoid the long running steps when one of the fast ones already failed. So you can safely remove the python-related dependencies. 

This is good first iteration which we could already merge. 
However, I could image to improve this to be even more fine granular and applying similar modifications for he UI and backend as well. But therefore we probably need something like https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter to get the desired behavior.

Currenly, our [python client](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-client-python) does not support running on Python `3.11`. This is mainly due to the missing compatibility of our dependency `nats-py` (as of version `2.2.0`).

### ToDos

- [x] make client Python `3.11` ready
- [x] add `3.11` tag to `setup.py` 
- [x] include `3.11` in pr validation workflow

Implement a GitHub workflow that automatically assigns labels to PRs.
Fur this purpose consider to use the following GitHub action: https://github.com/actions/labeler

### ToDos:

- [x] provide config file to define labeling rules
- [x] implement GitHub workflow that runs for every created PR and assigns labels to it

You can create a new file and call it e.g. `pr-labeling.yaml`.
This workflow should be executed when a PR is created.
Here you can follow the example of `labeler` pretty close: https://github.com/actions/labeler#create-workflow
The more difficult part is the configuration file. If you want to, you can take some time and familiarize your self with our existing labels and the codebase and come up with a proposal.

This issue is about setting about [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) for Apache StreamPipes.
It's only about the integration with the repository and GitHub actions not the account creation.
There should be different test scores for the different language parts, so we should have one for the backend, one for the UI and
one for the Python client.

### Body

This issue is about setting about [sonarcloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) for Apache StreamPipes.
It's only about the integration with the repository and GitHub actions not the account creation.
It would be great if different ways of integrating could be evaluated, e.g., failing CI step, adding a comment on the PR etc., and be discussed in [discussion](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/discussions).
Furthermore, it might make sense to differentiate between backend, UI and python client. Therefore, SonarCloud should be setup in [monorepo-mode](https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/monorepo-support/)
Finally, it would be great to extend the README with the corresponding badge.

## User Story
As a user, I want to configure an adapter, so that it is created but not started.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Adapter is added to `My adapters` view but not started
- E2E test validates this behaviour

## Additional Information
- When creating the adapter in the last view **Adapter Settings** there should be an option to only create the adapter without instantiating it.

Currently we use this dependency in the `help.component` of the preview dialog and in the `main.scss` file.
As described in PR #1090, these can be removed and replaced with internal CSS.

Maybe it is even possible to remove the `datatables.net-dt` dependency as well.

My suggestion would be that you start the latest StreamPipes release as described here [1].
The installation guide uses a docker compose file. This way we can make sure that everything works on your machine in docker and you can get familiar with the software and the UI.

Once this works you must stop the docker contaiers of the release version and try to start the development environment as before.
Let me know if you had any problems with the setup.

Cheers, 
Philipp

First we want to get rid of the library `datatables.net`. 
The CSS of this library is currently used in two components
- `PipelineElementPreviewComponent`
- `HelpComponent`

in the editor directory.

The CSS is imported in the file /scss/main.scss in line 22 (`@import '~datatables.net-dt/css/jquery.dataTables.css';`).

The HTML template of the `HelpComponent` uses the `dataTable` class to render a table.
You need to remove the library and provide some CSS to render the table properly.

To see the component in the software you need to add a new adapter (e.g. Machine Data Simulator) and then click on the `?` in the pipeline editor to see the live data.

## Description
The current e2e tests use FileSet adapters to validate the results of the tests. However, since we want to remove the sets, the tests shoud rely on the new FileStream adapter (see #1121).

The e2e tests should produce the same results when using the new FileStream adapter as they do when using the FileSet adapters

dev (current development state)

### Affected StreamPipes components

Connect

### What happened?

Recently, I was trying to play around streampipes and found that iotdb sink could not work properly.

I checked the source code and found that the current JDBC based implementation of iotdb sink is outdated, especially for the current production versions of iotdb (0.13.x and 1.0.x).

I‘d like to contribute a brand new iotdb sink implementation, which has the following features:

- Support production ready versions of IoTDB (version >= 0.13.0)
- Support by iotdb-session API, which can provide higher throughput and lower latency 
- Support schema-less write: no need to create storage group (database) before insertion

### How to reproduce?

Graph:
Water Level 1 -> IoTDB

I debugged the iotdb sink in pipeline-element mode and found that the current iotdb sink cannot connect to the iotdb instance (version >= 0.13.x).

### Expected behavior

IoTDB sink should be used with IoTDB (version >= 0.13.0)

In https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/1147 we introduced the resource for a function definition which defines a registered function in the StreamPipes backend. To provide full support of function API endpoint we need to implement the following aspects:

- [ ] resource container for function definition
- [ ] endpoint for function definition

The REST API endpoint for a function definition is defined [here](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-rest/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/rest/impl/FunctionsResource.java).
At least the `get()` and `all()` method should be implemented, we might also think about further endpoint methods like `create()` or `delete()`

As this library isn't maintained anymore, we should switch to `consul-api` where this error doesn't occur.

### What happened?

When the schema of data is guessed, many numerical formats are subsumed by the float type.
Integer, Double, Float, Long. [Code location](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/a23795b43a4a3d67021cc961ea2d956b639e390f/streampipes-extensions-management/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/extensions/management/connect/adapter/format/util/JsonEventProperty.java#L58)

This leads sometimes to error  when the data does not fit into the range of float.

E.g. When a timestamp attribute is given in ms
`{
  ""tree_size"": 162451767, 
  ""timestamp"": 1674637204330, 
  ""sha256_root_hash"": ""mIYlnASHw5nD\/9etlz\/BUoDhrAkER5H09IIK1I+jfmE=""
 }`

In this case it is not possible to use this attribute as timestamp since an exception occurs when the data is converted.

What do you think to use more specific types?

### How to reproduce?

Guess a schema from data with contains a number greater than float.
E.g. https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/argon2023/ct/v1/get-sth

### Expected behavior

In this example the guessed type schould be of type Long

The python functions should also support output data streams like in Java (see #1135). To implement this the following steps are needed:

1. [x] Extend the  `APIEndpoint` and refactor the `DataStream` data model to be able to post an output data stream to the REST API.
2. [x] Update the `Broker` to be able to publish messages to an output data stream.
3. [x] Extend the `FunctionDefinition` to make it possible to add output data streams to a function.
4. [x] Implement the functionality to create a new data stream to which you can continuously add output data.

thanks for responding. 
This issue is not about dependabot. The idea is to update the version of the used actions in [1].
Therefore you need to check the `uses` variable and check if there is a new version available.

Example:
```
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v1
```
to 
```
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v3

If I want to add a semantic type in the adapters, the field is too small to see the full length.
Either to see the full length or just the last bit of it with the important vocabulary.

I am willing to work on this as my first issue, if it can be assigned to me?

My understanding with this is that:

**Issue**:
The dropdown text(semantic type term) is not fully understandable to the user while selecting in case of long term.

**Proposed Resolution**:
With respect to fix, if we can pop up a tooltip (with full term value) while hovering on dropdown value as per below image.

Another idea that comes to my mind is to increase the width of the drop-down menu. Maybe you can give this a try as well?

We should improve the charts by adding more options and make them ready to be deployed on artifacthub

I worked in the branch SP-584 mentioned here
https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/1044#issuecomment-1416032823

I did a clean docker system prune because it was not necessary to persist the data. All containers and volumes were removed!
But something is wrong with the CouchDB and Influx DB versions after a new start.

```
influxdb:2.6                                                    treampipes-influxdb-1

Is this a correct behavior?

To deploy out Python library to pypi.org we need a dedicated GitHub workflow since we do not publish snapshot versions in the beginning. This workflow should only be triggered manually, which will be done during the release process. It only needs to build the wheel and publish the it to Pypi using `setup.py`.

- [x] build GitHub workflow
- [x] add PyPi credentials to GitHub @bossenti (available as `PYPI_TOKEN` )
- [x] update release process documentation in Confluence -> https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STREAMPIPES/Post-release+steps

We will test/run this during the release process of `0.91.0`.

4) `EventPropertiyPrimitiveBuilder` extend `.domainProperty(String domainProperty)` to List
5) `EpProperty` Double, Integer, Number General, Boolean, Image has only a single string

`(Label label, String runtimeName, List< URI> domainProperty)`

The class `KafkaTransportProtocol` uses the name `kafkaPort` protocol.
All the other transport protocols use the variable name `port`.

This should be harmonized.

I found the problem when I used the python client with a StreamPipes instance that uses kafka as the broker.
Then I tried to read the data streams (e.g. `client.dataStreamApi.all()`) and got the following error:

```
StreamPipesDataModelError: 
Oops, there seems to be a problem with our internal StreamPipes data model.
This should not occur, but unfortunately did.
Therefore, it would be great if you could report this problem as an issue at github.com/apache/streampipes.

The Python client should verify its authentication when being initialized.
Therefore, it could use the `versions` (`/v2/info/versions`) endpoint of the StreamPipes API which requires authentication and provides some information about the StreamPipes instance connected to.
At least the StreamPipes version should be added as an attribute of the Python client instance.

As of now, when implementing a StreamPipes function in Python there are two places where the connected data streams are stored: a) the functions `required_streams` property and b) the function defintion's `consumed_streams` attribute.
We should streamline this behavior. Probably we should remove `required_streams` in favor of `consumed_streams`.

Hi 

The file set adapter is losing some entries in the datalake
(starts with 4 entries, but only 2 are saved in the datalake)
Is something wrong with this csv? I don't think so.

## How to reproduce:
1) Setup of adapter with this csv as file set and csv import (delimiter , and header)
[distance.csv](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/files/10714833/distance.csv)

2) create simple pipeline with adapter and directly connected to datalake
does not matter if there are processors involved!

## What happens:
In the datalake are only 2 values stores => ID 2 and 3 are missing 
Only ID 1 and 4 are stored

## What is expected 
all four values are stored in the datalake

the problem with the CSV file is that it has no column for the ""timestamp"".
When you replay the data, the data is streamed as fast as it can be read. This means that all events are be created and a timestamp will be appended in the adapter.
It is very likely that multiple events will have the same timestamp and since this is the index in the data lake, only one of these events will be stored.

One possible solution would be to add a timestamp to the raw events. Another solution is to mark one of the properties as a dimension property, since one event can be stored for each dimension even if it has the same timestamp.

I hope this is helpful.
Thanks a lot!

When using the `Data Import` feature, broker settings are only overridden if the original and configured protocol are of the same class. In case of importing e.g., resources using a `NatsTransportProtocol` into an instance that uses Kafka, protocol settings should be replaced.

### Background
This issue aims to automatically validate the update process of StreamPipes, as discussed in issue #1193.

### Description
A Cypress test should be implemented to validate all functionalities after the update. Two workflows are required for this:

1. A workflow to set up the resources in the old system.
2. A workflow to validate that everything is still working as expected after the update.

### Design & Implementation Steps
- [ ] Define the steps to setup the system
- [ ] Define the steps to validate the updated system
- [ ] Implement the first workflow to set up the resources in the old system.
- [ ] Implement the second workflow to validate that everything is still working as expected after the update.


In [1] you can find some examples with more complex test settings as an example.

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **tenthe** January 17, 2023</sup>


## Harmonize `data set` and `data stream` APIs

We are currently looking at the Connect API and plan to refactor parts of it. Looking at the current implementation, I noticed that we have several cases that make the implementation more complex.

## Distinction between `data set` and `data stream` adapters

For example, we distinguish between `data set` and `data stream` adapters. Set adapters are treated as bounded streams, i.e. they stream a data set only once. Originally, this was added because it allows the user to replay existing events (e.g., from databases or files). However, I don't think this feature is used very often and we only have three implementations of set adapters. This feature adds a lot of overhead in many different places, such as the UI, the core, and extension services.

## Main features of current data sets

The main features of the data sets we currently use are:
- For the e2e tests to validate the processing elements
- Import a data set (e.g. CSV file) into the time-series storage

I think these are important and we should definitely keep them, but maybe we can find another solution to accomplish these tasks.

## Alternative solutions

New functionality:
- Add option to create adapters without starting them
- Add an option to the `FileStreamAdapter` to play the file only once

To import a dataset, a user (or the e2e tests) would need to create an adapter without starting it, create the pipeline, and then start the adapter.

## Recommendation

Since we don't have many benefits of the data set API, I would recommend removing it. This would also provide a clearer focus for StreamPipes because it focuses on streaming data produced by machines. Further, it will ease the implementation in many places without drawbacks in terms of functionality.
How do you see it?


PS: I would also like to harmonize the model for `GenericAdapters` and `SpecificAdapters`, but that is another discussion ;).

### Affected StreamPipes components

Processing Elements

### What happened?

When calculating a new field with the  `Math` processing element, you can only aggregate the calculation result with `First`, `Last`, `Mode` and `Count` in the Data Explorer, but you can't use `Mean`, `Min`, `Max` or `Sum`. 

### How to reproduce?

Create a pipeline, use a data source with two numerical fields and use the  `Math` processing element to calculate a new field:
![math_pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43231162/219004142-7d98ba94-6fd5-4946-a4fd-648ef20e289e.png)
When you agregate the calculation result with `First` every thing is fine:

But if you try to show the `Mean` it does't work:

### Expected behavior

Maybe there's an error with the type of the calculation result.

### Affected StreamPipes components

Processing Elements

### What happened?

When aggregating a field over 1 day in the Data Explorer, it uses the wrong time window to aggregate this field. When using data within the CET time zone and you try to aggregate them, it uses the time window from 1:00 a.m. on his day to 1:00 am on the next day, which is probably the the time window of this day in UTC.

### How to reproduce?

Load this [data](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/files/10742814/test.csv) into StreamPipes.
When looking at the raw data you will see that the values are just the current number of hours of this day for every half hour (This may depend on your current timezone):
![raw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43231162/219027478-d891741d-0f74-4a42-ad01-eeda069eb142.png)
But when you aggregate the values for every day, you can see that the first value of the day is 1 and the last value is 0.5. And a day appears for which normally no data exist:
![aggregated](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43231162/219029219-f9621622-b11d-42dc-87a8-d3d2d05a5213.png)


### Expected behavior

The problem is probably that the UTC time is used to aggregate the data. While the raw data is displayed depending on your current time zone.

The **Swinging Door Trending (SDT)** algorithm is a linear trend compression algorithm. In essence, it replaces a series of continuous `(timestamp, value)` points with a straight line determined by the start and end points.

The **Swinging Door Trending (SDT) Filter Processor** can extract and forward the characteristic events of the original stream. In general, this filter can also be used to reduce the frequency of original data in a lossy way.

This issue is created to track the implementation of the filter processor. It is originally from a discussion. For more information, please see: #1285

Historically, we used a three class based approach to define our pipeline elements (processors and sinks).
A while ago we introduced a simplified one class approach to define pipeline elements.
Therefore, we need to migrate all existing pipeline elements.

### Processors

**Old approach**
A processor is defined by the following three classes:
* [`StandaloneEventProcessingDeclarer`
](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-wrapper-standalone/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/standalone/declarer/StandaloneEventProcessingDeclarer.java)
* [`EventProcessorBindingParams`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-wrapper/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/params/binding/EventProcessorBindingParams.java)
* [`EventProcessor`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-wrapper/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/runtime/EventProcessor.java)

Examples can be found below.

**New approach**
Only use the following class to define a processing element:
* [`StreamPipesDataProcessor`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-wrapper-standalone/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/standalone/StreamPipesDataProcessor.java)

See an example: [`WelfordChangeDetection`
](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-processors-change-detection-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/processors/changedetection/jvm/welford/WelfordChangeDetection.java)

### Sinks

**Old approach**
A sink is defined by the following three classes:
* [`StandaloneEventSinkDeclarer`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-wrapper-standalone/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/standalone/declarer/StandaloneEventSinkDeclarer.java)
* [`EventSinkBindingParams`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-wrapper/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/params/binding/EventSinkBindingParams.java)
* [`EventSink`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/58f920d0d6b2463a326d94e0f254f1ff7fa0e0f2/streampipes-wrapper/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/runtime/EventSink.java)

Examples can be found below.

**New approach**

* [`StreamPipesDataSink`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-wrapper-standalone/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/wrapper/standalone/StreamPipesDataSink.java)

See an example: [`RocketMQPublisherSink`](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-sinks-brokers-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/sinks/brokers/jvm/rocketmq/RocketMQPublisherSink.java)

### Final tasks

- [x] #1632
- [x] remove deprecated [cusum processor](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-processors-change-detection-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/processors/changedetection/jvm/cusum/Cusum.java) https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/1586

### How to contribute?
Pick one processor or sink, leave a comment below that you want to work on it
This ensures that we keep an overview and tasks are not done multiple times
When you have done the refactoring of one component, file us a PR
This way we approach to tackle this large refactoring effort step by step

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting a first glimpse on how to implement custom pipeline elements.

StreamPipes allows you to choose the actual messaging broker that is used for the internal StreamPipes communication.
To easily inspect what messaging broker is running, a user should get this information as part of the `System Info` view within the UI.

One can access this view as displayed below.
![version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50115603/219972626-6700fe5c-e638-440f-a196-4dc170b0c5d9.gif)

Therefore, the following tasks need to be done:

- [ ] Add section about the messaging broker to the UI component: https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/ui/src/app/info/versions/versions.component.html
- [ ] Extend response of the API endpoint `info` by the required information: 
https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-rest/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/rest/impl/Version.java

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes and are both interested in API and UI development.

### Affected StreamPipes components

Backend

### What happened?

When querying the data lake API for measurements with the `columns` parameter (allowing to filter the returned data for the selected columns), the following behavior is observed:

The queried data lake measure contains data from the machine data simulator in the `density` mode.

1) Providing invalid columns
If we query invalid columns, e.g. `test1234`, via `http://localhost:80/streampipes-backend/api/v4/datalake/measurements/test?columns=test1234`, the returned result does not contain any records -> expected ✅ 

2) Provide valid columns
If we query valid columns, e.g. `time` and `density` via `http://localhost:80/streampipes-backend/api/v4/datalake/measurements/test?columns=time,density`, the returned result does only contain the given columns -> expected ✅ 

3) Provide combination of valid and invalid columns
If we quer a combination of valid and invalid columns, e.g. `time`, `density` and `test1234` via `http://localhost:80/streampipes-backend/api/v4/datalake/measurements/test?columns=time,density,test1234`, the returned result contains the data of the valid columns plus the invalid columns filled up with `null`.

...
]
```

-> not expected 🔴 

This behavior is independent from the order of the column names

### How to reproduce?

As described above

### Expected behavior

The API should either return an empty data measurement to be consistent with scenario `1)`

Hi, all

[The core developement doc](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STREAMPIPES/Core) seems wrong because we have moved the `streampipes-backend` to `streampipes-core` [in this commit](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/commit/77ad34f7a41127a6f48ea479663863dc84e8d56d).

Therefore I try to use this configuration: https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/.idea/runConfigurations/core.xml to start the local backend. But it raises these errors:

Not sure why. There may be some problems in the environment setting.
Do you have the same issue? Could you provide a new doc to develop the backend? Thanks!

I'm starting it using commands `./streampipes env --set backend` and `./streampipes up -d`. The UI is started in the docker: https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/0f6bcf55f27b1c0640dd3adf9abef7b8dbc92289/installer/cli/environments/backend#L23

I see that the backend trying to connect to port 8090, but there is not service exposed the port 8090 in the docker.
Here is the log I found from the backend:

dev (current development state)

### Affected StreamPipes components

Backend

### What happened?

The endpoint for data lake measurements allows to filter the data records when querying for a specific measurement.
Hereby, you define a time window for which you want to get data by specifying `startDate` and `endDate`.
If you choose both parameters so that there are no records matching your criterion in the data lake, the API returns no data series in the response like the whole measurement would not exist.

### How to reproduce?

Query the API endpoint `/api/v4/datalake/measurements/<identifier>` and extend the query by `?startDate=valueStart&endDate=valueEnd`. 
Choose `valueStart` and `valueEnd` in such way that there are no entries for targeted measurement in the corresponding time frame.
Eventually, the API returns a response with no data series indicating the whole measurement does not exist.

### Expected behavior

Return the metadata of the data series but with an empty array for `rows` so that it clearly indicates that the actual measurement exists but there is to data available for the given query.

**The InfluxDB client always returns a response with no metadata when querying a timeline with no data between startDate and endDate (even if the timeline exists).** 

So, there seems to be some difficulty in achieving the expected behavior. In fact, I have some immature solutions in my mind. But in my solutions, at least one query call of Influxdb needs to be added in `DataExplorerQueryV4#executeQuery`, which may also cause additional problems...

Since we've removed the `getOwnPipelines` method from the REST API, pipelines are not displayed in the UI as the endpoint is still used in the `platform-services` module.

### *****Apache StreamPipes*****

Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. StreamPipes offers several modules including StreamPipes Connect to easily connect data from industrial IoT sources, the Pipeline Editor to quickly create processing pipelines and several visualization modules for live and historic data exploration. Under the hood, StreamPipes utilizes an event-driven microservice paradigm of standalone, so-called analytics microservices making the system easy to extend for individual needs.

### *****Background*****

StreamPipes is grown significantly throughout recent years. We were able to introduce a lot of new features and attracted both users and contributors. Putting the cherry on the cake, we were graduated as an Apache top level project in December 2022. We will of course continue developing new features and never rest to make StreamPipes even more amazing. Although, since we are approaching with full stream towards our `1.0` release, we want to project also to get more mature. Therefore, we want to address one of our Achilles' heels: our test coverage.

Don't worry, this issue is not about implementing myriads of tests for our code base. As a first step, we would like to make the status quo transparent. That means we want to measure our code coverage consistently across the whole codebase (Backend, UI, Python library) and report the coverage to [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/). Furthermore, to benchmark ourselves and motivate us to provide tests with every contributing, we would like to lock the current test coverage as an lower threshold that we always want to achieve (meaning in case we drop CI builds fail etc). With time we then can increase the required coverage lever step to step.

More than monitoring our test coverage, we also want to invest in better and more clean code. Therefore, we would like to adopt [sonarcloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) for our repository.


### *****Tasks*****

- [ ] calculate test coverage for all main parts of the repo
- [ ] send coverage to codeCov
- [ ] determine coverage threshold and let CI fail if below
- [ ] include sonarcloud in CI setup
- [ ] include automatic coverage report in PR validation (see an example [here](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/648#issuecomment-509855300)) -> optional
- [ ] include automatic sonarcloud report in PR validation -> optional
- [ ] what ever comes in your mind 💡 further ideas are always welcome

### ❗ ****Important Note**** ❗ 
Do not create any account in behalf of Apache StreamPipes in Sonarcloud or in CodeCov or using the name of Apache StreamPipes for any account creation. Your mentor will take care of it.

### *****Relevant Skills*****

- basic knowledge about GitHub worfklows

### *****Learning Material*****

- [GitHub workflow docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)
- [Apache StreamPipes workflows](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/.github/workflows)
- [Sonarcloud for Monorepos](https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/monorepo-support/)

Base on a feature request in #1236, we want to extend our [family of data sinks ](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-extensions) with one for MicrosoftSQL databases.
This sink should be able to store data from a StreamPipes data stream to a MicrosoftSQL database. Thereby, at least basic authentication should be available, ideally we could even provide SSL-secured connections.

If there is JDBC client library available (license must be applicable, ideally Apache License), then we can make use of the existing [JDBC implementation](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-sinks-databases-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/sinks/databases/jvm/jdbcclient) for sinks, see for reference the [PostgreSQL sink](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-sinks-databases-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/sinks/databases/jvm/postgresql).

Please see also our tutorial on how to implement new sinks: https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/extend-tutorial-data-sinks.html

I implemented a requiredMultiValueSelection in my declaireMethoth.

It is working as expected but it allows, that no value is selected.

```
        .requiredMultiValueSelection(
            Labels.withId(VALIDATION_TYPE_KEY),
            Options.from(
                ValidationType.IsEmpty.name(),
                ValidationType.IsSimple.name()
            )
        )
```

**What I expect.**
Select one or two of these options
It should check if at least one field is selected.

**What happens.**
I can finish the Pipeline and no value is selected.

So far this is the only example I know of where this is possible. So in the Processor it has to be intercepted extra if the List size is 0.

For example, with requiredText it is not possible for the user to allow an empty string as input.
In my eyes MultiValueSelection is the extension of SingleValueSelection and also here it is not allowed to have no selection.

The current implementation uses `DataSeries` as return type for data queried in the data lake. 
This should be harmonized with the java implementation that uses `QueryResult` instead.

### Apache StreamPipes

Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. StreamPipes offers several modules including StreamPipes Connect to easily connect data from industrial IoT sources, the Pipeline Editor to quickly create processing pipelines and several visualization modules for live and historic data exploration. Under the hood, StreamPipes utilizes an event-driven microservice paradigm of standalone, so-called analytics microservices making the system easy to extend for individual needs.

### Background

StreamPipes has grown significantly over the past few years, with new features and contributors joining the project. However, as the project continues to evolve, e2e test coverage must also be improved to ensure that all features remain functional. Modern frameworks, such as Cypress, make it quite easy and fun to automatically test even complex application functionalities. As StreamPipes approaches its 1.0 release, it is important to improve e2e testing to ensure the robustness of the project and its use in real-world scenarios.

### Tasks

- [ ] Write e2e tests using Cypress to cover most functionalities and user interface components of StreamPipes.
- [ ] Add more complex testing scenarios to ensure the reliability and robustness of StreamPipes in real-world use cases (e.g. automated tests for version updates)
- [ ] Add e2e tests for the new Python client to ensure its integration with the main system and its functionalities (#774)
- [ ] Document the testing infrastructure and the testing approach to allow for easy maintenance and future contributions.

### ❗ ****Important Note**** ❗

Do not create any account on behalf of Apache StreamPipes in Cypress or using the name of Apache StreamPipes for any account creation. Your mentor will take care of it.

### Relevant Skills

- Familiarity with testing frameworks, such as Cypress or Selenium.
- Experience with TypeScript or Java
- Basic knowledge of Angular is helpful
- Familiarity with Docker and containerization is a plus.

### Learning Material

- [Cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)
- [Learn Cypress](https://learn.cypress.io/)
- [Angular docs](https://angular.io/docs)

Although, we have a dedicated [vocubalury ](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-vocabulary) that provides extensive definitions of several [domain properties](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/extend-sdk-stream-requirements.html#specifying-semantics) and other stuff, we have plenty of places in our code where we still have hard coded domain properties. One example can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-processors-geo-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/processors/geo/jvm/jts/processor/epsg/EpsgProcessor.java#L55).

### Tasks

- [ ] collect hard-coded domain properties
- [ ] extend (and rework) vocabulayry
- [ ] replace hard-coded domain properties by vocabulary
- [ ] (extend vocabulary by common runtime names, see https://github.com/apache/streampipes/discussions/1265) 

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes and its SDK.

Unfortunately not
The standard approach that is common for the vast majority of open source projects is that you create a fork of your target (in this case StreamPipes) and then create a PR from your fork to our repo
Here are some more information on how to do that: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5Wmx6V/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently, the python client expects a comma separated string when specifying the columns to be returned ( query parameter `columns`, see [here](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-client-python/streampipes/endpoint/api/data_lake_measure.py#LL42)) for a data lake measure. This is quite inconvenient and should be replaced by the option to provide a list of strings which is then converted to a comma separated string for the actual query param. This transformation should be done with a [pydantic validator](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/validators/).

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @SvenO3 , or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes and making their first steps in our Python library.

Currently, our documentation for the Python lib is unversioned.
This should be changed to be able to differentiate between the currently released version and the development state at least (ideally also for all hostoric releases). Therefore, our [Mkdocs ](https://www.mkdocs.org/)setup should be configured accordingly.
Here are some information about it from the official documentation:
https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-versioning/

As a first step it would be great to have it running with some sample commands.
Ideally, this would already be integrated with our [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/.github/workflows/python-docs.yml).

Currently, icons, files and documentation is stored in a fixed folder in the backend (user.home/.streampipes). In some scenarios (e.g., when running the backend Docker container as a custom/non-root user), it might be necessary to manually provide the folder for storing assets and files.

This should be done by introducing a new environment variable `SP_CORE_ASSET_BASE_DIR`.

The module `streampipes-data-explorer` contains some functionality which we currently don't use, such as setting retention policies on the database. These should be removed to get a clear picture of currently used functionality for potential future database migrations.

### *****Apache StreamPipes*****

Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. StreamPipes offers several modules including StreamPipes Connect to easily connect data from industrial IoT sources, the Pipeline Editor to quickly create processing pipelines and several visualization modules for live and historic data exploration. Under the hood, StreamPipes utilizes an event-driven microservice paradigm of standalone, so-called analytics microservices making the system easy to extend for individual needs.

### *****Background*****

StreamPipes is grown significantly throughout recent years. We were able to introduce a lot of new features and attracted both users and contributors. Putting the cherry on the cake, we were graduated as an Apache top level project in December 2022. We will of course continue developing new features and never rest to make StreamPipes even more amazing. 

StreamPipes really shines when connecting Industrial IoT data. Such data sources typically originate from machine controllers, called PLCs (e.g., Siemens S7). But there are also new protocols such as OPC-UA which allow to browse available data within the controller. Our goal is to make connectivity of industrial data sources a matter of minutes.

Currently, data sources can be connected using the built-in module `StreamPipes Connect` from the UI. We provide a set of adapters for popular protocols that can be customized, e.g., connection details can be added. 

To make it even easier to connect industrial data sources with StreamPipes, we plan to add an OPC-UA browser. This will be part of the entry page of StreamPipes connect and should allow users to enter connection details of an existing OPC-UA server. Afterwards, a new view in the UI shows available data nodes from the server, their status and current value. Users should be able to select values that should be part of a new adapter. Afterwards, a new adapter can be created by reusing the current workflow to create an OPC-UA data source.

This is a really cool project for participants interested in full-stack development who would like to get a deeper understanding of industrial IoT protocols. Have fun! 


### *****Tasks*****

- [ ] get familiar with the OPC-UA protocol
- [ ] develop mockups which demonstrate the user workflow
- [ ] develop a data model for discovering data from OPC-UA
- [ ] create the backend business logic for the OPC-UA browser 
- [ ] create the frontend views to asynchronously browse data and to create a new adapter
- [ ] write Junit, Component and E2E tests
- [ ] what ever comes in your mind 💡 further ideas are always welcome


### *****Relevant Skills*****

- interest in Industrial IoT and procotols such as OPC-UA
- Java development skills
- Angular/Typescript development skills

Anyways, the most important relevant skill is motivation and readiness to learn during the project!

### *****Learning Material*****

- [StreamPipes documentation](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/user-guide-introduction.html)
- [Our current OPC-UA adapter](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-connect-adapters-iiot/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/connect/iiot/adapters/opcua)
- [Eclipse Milo, which we currently use for OPC-UA connectivity](https://github.com/eclipse/milo)
- [Apache PLC4X, which has an API for browsing](https://plc4x.apache.org/)

*****Mentor*****
 - Dominik Riemer (riemer[at]apache.org).

welcome at StreamPipes 🎉 
Great that you are interested in our GSOC challenge.
With respect to contributions, are talking about making contributions beside the GSOC?
In this case you may have a look on the following issues:
- https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/1113 might be valuable to mark yourself familiar with the functionality of our adapters in general
- In case you want to make yourself familiar with our current OPC-UA setup there are two options: 1) https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/889 and 2) add caching for OPC-UA adapters (here we do not have an issue yet, but an existing discussion https://github.com/apache/streampipes/discussions/888#discussioncomment-4483352)
- Another issue for discovering our adapters: https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/530
- Here are two great issues to make yourself familiar with our pipeline elements: https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/1315 & https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/529

In case you are interested in one of them, just leave a comment there. This allows me to assign you.

Design a custom 404-page and overwrite the default page provided by mkdocs-material.
This should fit in the general style of the existing Python docs. A grain of humor would be awesome.

Our [Python docs](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-client-python/docs) are built using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
This allows to easily configure a dark mode as described here: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/?h=dark+mode#color-palette-toggle
This issue is about configuring the dark mode for our Python docs via the [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-client-python/mkdocs.yml). Please pay some attention on the selected primary and accent color for the dark theme.

### Monitoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @SvenO3 , or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes, and want to get a little hands-on to our Python library.

Currently, the HTTP connectors only support very basic user-defined parameters. Users should be able to add custom headers, e.g., for providing authentication options.

Headers are typically key/value pairs. So we could add an optional configuration option to assign a list of these key/value pairs which would then be used for reading/writing from/to the HTTP endpoint.
One example would be Authentication headers (such as Bearer Tokens), provision of content types or any other HTTP header. E.g., in a future extension, we could add a feature to the REST controller to send events in different formats such as JSON or YAML.
The Apache HTTP fluent library which is used in the `RestPublisher` provides several convenience methods to add headers to a request. These would be read from the user-provided configuration. E.g., we could have a `CollectionStaticProperty` with a group of key/value pairs.
Hope this helps!

RDF4J introduces several breaking changes according to the changelogs (see [here](https://rdf4j.org/release-notes/4.0.0/) and [here](https://rdf4j.org/release-notes/4.0.0-m1/)). Therefore, we need to check the changes introduced and adapt our implementation accordingly.

I'll assign you to this ticket immediately.

The task of this issue is easy to explain.
We are making use of the library [`RDF4J `](https://rdf4j.org/) throughout our codebase.
Now we want to upgrade to the most recent release (we recently upgraded to the latest `3.x` version in #1472)
Version `4.0.0` introduces some changes that affect us as well.
So we need to read through the release notes linked in the ticket description and adapt the codebase accordingly.
Additionally, you can simpy increase the version in the [POM file ](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/pom.xml#L111) and check if there are any errors when running `mvn clean verify` .

In terms of setting up the development environment: you need to check out the repository, ensure that Maven and Java (JDK 17) are installed
With that you are alrready good to go for this task 🙂 ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5Zv--K/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

## Description:
When using the export feature, we have noticed that the data streams are removed from the pipeline. This causes issues when you reimport the .zip file.

## Steps to reproduce:
- Create a pipeline with a data stream
- Create an asset and link all resources
- Export the asset
- Reimport the zip into another StreamPipes instance

## Expected behavior:
The pipeline should work as expected

## Actual behavior:
The pipeline can be started and stoped but not edited. The stream is missing in the pipeline editor.

When attempting to compile a single Maven module, an error message appears stating that the file  `tools/maven/checkstyle-header.txt` could not be found [1].
This occurs because the path is only correct when the Maven command is executed in the root directory.

What do you think about the idea of defining a variable that points to the correct location? 

I have tested this with Maven, Eclipse, and IntelliJ and have not encountered any issues so far. 
If the variable is not set, the default path will be used, which means that no changes are necessary.

great to hear that you are interested in contributing here 🤩 
I can assign the issue to you, if you want.

I think the first step for you would be to get the development environment for StreamPipes ready and get a basic understanding for StreamPipes.
Here are some supporting links:
- https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STREAMPIPES/Extensions
- https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/extend-tutorial-data-sources.html
- https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/extend-tutorial-data-processors.html
- https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/extend-tutorial-data-sinks.html

Once you are ready, you can actually start to work on this issue.
Like stated in the description, it is about adding some more advanced configuration settings to the MQTT adapter.
Some of the listed ones are already implemented for the [MQTT sink](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-sinks-brokers-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/sinks/brokers/jvm/mqtt), so you can have a look there as well.

Ideally, you could event extend then the E2E tests for MQTT and include the improvements you introduce while working on this (see #1489).

Hope this answers your questions, makes you ready to start and does not overwhelm you 🙂

Currently, notifications are bound to a pipeline so that notifications are not shown if a pipeline is no longer present. I would see two options to solve this:
1) Notifications that belong to a pipeline are deleted once the pipeline is deleted.
2) We rewrite the notification module so that notifications are not bound to a pipeline, but could potentially also be created by other parts of the application. Notifications in the notification view would then not be organized by pipelines, but would include all notifications assigned to the user and maybe could be filtered by a notification type.

Since I think existing notification should not just disappear as in option 1, I tend to prefer 2.

StreamPipes allows users to configure simple value transformations or measurement conversions directly during adapter creation which are then applied directly when the data is read from the source:

<img width=""1398"" alt=""Bildschirmfoto 2023-04-19 um 16 48 04"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50115603/233114972-2866ea69-8666-45f1-aa74-892b435a03cb.png"">

This is a convenient feature which provides a shorthand for using a dedicated processing element in the pipeline definition.
Nevertheless, once the applied transformations are not apparent anymore, so it is somehow happening secretly.
I think this is not ideal and can lead to confusion if multiple users work with the same assets in StreamPipes.
Therefore, my suggestion would be add some information about this in the adapter info:
![adapter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50115603/233115958-e77f07f3-32d4-4b21-a8ed-cf495a1f5eaf.gif)

and add a small indicator in the pipeline editor which then provides detailed information when hovering over it.

How do you think about this idea? Do you have any other places in mind where this information could be useful?
Or is it already somewhere accessible and I've missed it? </div>","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/1534/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Within the last time we have spend a lot of work in our OPC-UA adpater, so this one is now really mature.
So, let's take some time to celebrate and write a blogpost that demonstrates the functionality and all features of this adapter.

The blog post should contain:

* an introduction to OPC-UA
       - what is it?
       - for which purpose is it used?
* show step by step how to connect to an OPC-UA source with streampipes
* demonstrate how easy it is to extract value from the data

Our blog posts are part of our website repository: https://github.com/apache/streampipes-website

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, or, @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes and like to write technical articles.

welcome to StreamPipes 👋🏼 
Glad you are interested in working on this blog post.

The topic is available. Would you want to start working on it right away?
The reason I ask is that we are currently revising our OPC-UA support (see #1650). 
So it would be best if the blog post promoted the new version of our adapter and sink first. This might take some more time.
But you could at least start with the part about OPC-UA in general if you want to.

Do I understand your problem correctly, you were able to connect to OPC-UA and start an adapter? And the adapter displayed data in the live preview?
However, the data cannot be visualized in the Data Explorer?

Can you check if the data explorer works with other data like the machine data simulator?

In larger setups with many resources such as pipelines or data explorer views, it might be hard to find a specific resource. We can add a new feature to assign ""labels"" (similar to Github labels) to these resources so that resources can be more easily discovered and filtered.

The current implementation of OPC UA schema detection in our GitHub repository only supports numbers as Identifier Types. However, as discussed in issue #1567 and according to the OPC UA specification [Link](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part6/v104/docs/5.2.2), the schema detection should be enhanced to support all Identifier Types defined by OPC UA.

# Open question:
We need to clarify whether the identification of Identifier Types can be inferred automatically or if users need to provide this information manually.

# Proposed Solution:
To optimize the current implementation, the following steps are suggested:

1. Review the OPC UA specification [Link](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part6/v104/docs/5.2.2) thoroughly to understand the complete list of Identifier Types defined.
2. Update the schema detection logic to support all the identified Identifier Types.
3. Consider implementing an automatic inference mechanism that detects the Identifier Type based on the data provided by the OPC UA server. This can include analyzing metadata, examining naming conventions, or utilizing specific OPC UA server features.
4. If automatic inference is not feasible or reliable, provide clear instructions to users on how to manually provide the Identifier Types information for their OPC UA server. This can be in the form of user input during the connection process.

By implementing these changes, we can enhance the OPC UA schema detection capabilities, making it more versatile and accommodating for a wider range of OPC UA servers and Identifier Types.

But can you provide a very rough estimate when this issue might be available in a new release? I'm currently building up a new explorative analysis infrastructure, but this contains OPC UA servers providing many non-integer nodes. I'd *love* to use Streampipes for this, but may need to come up with a different solution, if Streampipes can't handle non-integer nodes. Sorry again for being pushy!

Actually, I did some more testing. I think I might have put you on the wrong track! I find that Streampipes is able to read nodes of types Int, Float, String and Boolean. It fails, however, when reading a node with a custom data type defined in the server itself. The custom type in my example is defined, see attached screenshot, as a variant of the String type in a subfolder of 'Types/DataTypes/OPC Binary/'. Could it be that Streampipes does not read and integrate custom types from the 'Types' folder and therefore fails when it encounters a node with this custom data type?

please take for granted that you don't bother us. We highly appreciate all the feedback and insights you share with us, we are gaining a lot of value from them. So please keep that spirit and help us to improve StreamPipes 🙂 
It would be really great if you could StreamPipes for your use case, and it's very nice to see that you seem to like StreamPipes despite some issues you encountered.

From our side, improving the OPC-UA adapter is the next topic we want to address, as we have already received some feedback where we should improve (your feedback counts massively here). Currently, there is a huge big PR (https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/1290) that we need to complete first. But after that, OPC-UA will be definitely a focus topic.

As for the time until a possible release, it's quite hard to put a number on as we can't really plan how many time we can invest in StreamPipes besides our everyday life.
I can understand that this is probably not helpful for you... But if you could share a rough time window by when you would need the changes in a release, then we could at least roughly estimate whether this is realistic for us or not.

Currently, the backup process in our migration script only includes stream adapters, neglecting the set adapters. However, when a user needs to roll back the migration, it becomes necessary to also restore the set adapters.

To address this issue, we need to update the migration script to ensure that both stream adapters and set adapters are included in the backup collection during the CouchDB migration. This will enable us to maintain data integrity and functionality during rollbacks.

When a user starts two instances of the HTTP Stream adapter simultaneously, it has been observed that one of the instances stops emitting events. 

To resolve this issue, we need to investigate and identify the root cause of the event emission halt when multiple instances of the HTTP Stream adapter are running.

The pipeline element `CumSum`  has been marked as deprecated already in version `0.71.0`  and has been replaced by the `WelfordDetection` .
Accordingly,  it's now time to remove this processing element.

### Summary

The IO-Link Master (AL1350) has an IoT interface to transmit sensor data over MQTT. As a user, I would like to have an adapter that connects IO-Link sensor data into StreamPipes.

### Details

The IO-Link Master can be configured to transmit JSON events to an MQTT broker. These JSON events contain meta-information and the values of the sensors connected to the port. However, the sensor values are encoded and require decoding for each sensor type.

The challenge we need to address is that an IO-Link Master can have different sensor types connected, but in StreamPipes, a fixed event schema is required for each data stream.

### Proposed Solution

To tackle this challenge, I suggest the following solution:

- **User Input:**
  - MQTT configuration: Allow users to configure the MQTT connection settings.
  - Select IO Link Ports: Enable users to select the IO Link ports they want to integrate with StreamPipes.
  - Select sensor type: Provide an option for users to select the sensor type connected to each port.

- **Output Schema:**
  - The output schema should be dependent on the selected sensor type. Each sensor type may have a different event schema in StreamPipes.

### Additional Information

There are multiple options available for mapping the MQTT event to the StreamPipes event. The suggested solution provides flexibility to users, allowing them to configure the MQTT settings and the sensor type.

By implementing this adapter, users will be able to seamlessly integrate IO-Link sensor data into StreamPipes, providing a unified and consistent event schema for analysis and processing.

If the StreamPipes Python Functions want to connect to a data stream and the connection isn't successful, it waits for a connection forever without giving feedback to the user. Therefore an error message should be created after the connection couldn't be established after a given time.

### Affected StreamPipes components

Processing Elements

### What happened?

Similar as #778 
When attempting to run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d`, I received the following error message:
```
 - sources-vehicle-simulator Error                                                                                 3.2s
Error response from daemon: manifest for apachestreampipes/sources-vehicle-simulator:0.92.0-SNAPSHOT not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```
After further investigation on [apachestreampipes/sources-vehicle-simulator Tags | Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apachestreampipes/sources-vehicle-simulator/tags), it appears that the latest available version is 0.69.0.

### How to reproduce?

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d`

### Expected behavior

Launch as normal

Hi @bossenti, thank you for reaching out. Yes, I would appreciate some help. 🙏🏼
I think the root cause of the issue may be that `sources-vehicle-simulator` is not included in `streampipes/.github/workflows/build.yml`. As I noticed, the source code of this image is continually updated. So I assume adding this task to `build.yml` like [Task: Build and Push Docker Image sources-watertank-simulator](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/d072af709b90b67e3c4f3485c85160731731307b/.github/workflows/build.yml#L135) can solve the problem.
Do you and have any concern about this? @bossenti @tenthe

thank you very much.
You are right, it seems that the Docker image is not currently built.
I think we need to decide if we want to include this container in the full release or not.
My suggestion would be that we remove it for future releases, but as long as it is part of `docker-compose.ym`, we should provide a container.

SparkplugB (SpB) is a MQTT specification aiming primarily at the manufacturing industry to connect network nodes in an IIOT infrastructure. In order to standardize how things communicate in a manufacturing setting via MQTT, SpB defines the following things:
- MQTT topic namespace
- MQTT state management
- MQTT payload structure


The following should be integrated in StreamPipes:

Adapter:
- reading data with StreamPipes that is provided via SpB
- mapping the SpB payload structure to the StreamPipes internal data structure
- acting as a SpB compliant client (e.g. handling NCMD, DCMD, NDEATH payloads)

DataSink:
- building SparkplugB payloads according to the SpB specification
- mapping StreamPipes data to the SpB payloads
- publishing the SpB payloads

In #1289 we introduced a large refactoring for our adapters.
This significantly improves the way we can define adapters.
Therefore, we should write and adapt the existing documentation to answer the following questions:

- [x] how to create an adapter with the new interfaces?
- [ ] how to implement additional parsers?
- [ ] how to use the adapter migration?

To bump the current StreamPipes version in the various installers (docker-compose, CLI and k8s helm charts), we use the `upgrade_version.sh` script in the `installer` folder.
After some changes to the `values.yaml file, the versions script seems to be broken as it not only replaces StreamPipes versions, but also the versions of Consul, CouchDB and InfluxDB.

* How to resolve
Revisit the logic in the `upgrade_versions` module and make sure that only the versions related to StreamPipes are updated.

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes and like to apply some bash magic..

Thanks for the information. If the OSPP participants will refine this feature, I'm willing to stay engaged in the discussion, or I'll continue to follow this issue. @bossenti 
After consideration, I think the following approach aligns better with our goals: incorporating specific comments before and after the version number, similar to [this example](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/7130732f53b603db1c805b6d7785c609ac107024/installer/k8s/README.md?plain=1#L21-L23), and utilizing a script to match the version number within the restricted section.

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **luoluoyuyu** May 27, 2023</sup>
### Problem Description
SpKafkaConsumer's process of creating consumers is an asynchronous process. If the connected topic has not submitted data, the data produced by the producer to the topic will be lost in the process of the consumer connecting to the topic. (The situation that creates the problem can be found in https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-integration-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/streampipes/integration/adapters/AdaptersTest.java#LL28C1-L28C1)
```
public class AdaptersTest {
  public void testAdapter(AdapterTesterBase adapterTester) throws Exception {
    adapterTester.startAdapterService();
    AdapterDescription adapterDescription = adapterTester.prepareAdapter();
    adapterTester.startAdapter(adapterDescription);
    List<Map<String, Object>> data = adapterTester.generateData();
    adapterTester.validateData(data);
  }
}
```
### Reason
In AdaptersTest, for example, consumers and producers are created asynchronously. When the created topic has not been submitted by a consumer for the same consumer group, the default behavior of the consumer in this case is to consume only the newly generated data after the consumer connects to the topic. When the producer produces a message during the consumer's connection to the topic, the consumer also loses the corresponding data.

### Solutions
Add the corresponding configuration items, for the same consumer group, if no offset has been submitted, then start consuming from the beginning

```
public class ConsumerConfigFactory extends AbstractConfigFactory {
    private static final String AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG_DEFAULT=""earliest"";
    
    @Override
  public Properties makeDefaultProperties() {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    //.....
     props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG,AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG_DEFAULT);
    return props;
  }
}
```

### Description
A user should have the ability round numeric values in a pipeline. Therefore, a new processor is required that provides the functionality to round numeric numbers of the event.

### Example Configuration
- **Multiselect**: The processor should allow the user to select all numeric values in the data stream for rounding.
- **Numeric Input**: The user should be able to specify the precision to which the values should be rounded.

### Output Schema
The input schema should not be changed

### Additional Functionality
If you have any other ideas for the functionality of this new processor, please feel free to add them here.

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.

- I am using Labels.from() to create a label and according to source code this method is marked as deprecated. Is this a problem?
- Just want to confirm the exact meaning of rounding, currently I am using the conventional round half up.
- When I try to update the new processor, there's an error message ""Icon missing"", is there a place to add an icon to the processor?
- This question is not really related to this processor but I am curious: Why only event.addField()'s implementation uses runtime name (what's after s0::) and other functions such as getFieldBySelector() and removeFieldBySelector() use the selector?

Here are some answers to your questions:
* Instead of Labels.from, you can use `Labels.withId` by providing an ID only. By doing so, you can provide a `strings.en` file in the resources folder where you can provide titles and descriptions for every ID that you refer to. The advantage is that this approach allows us to add more translations in the future, once a multi-language StreamPipes version is available. There are many examples in the `streampipes-extensions` folder, e.g., `streampipes-processors-filters-jvm` that might help to see how IDs can be provided.
* I think conventional rounding is ok, or we could think of an advanced version where the user could provide the number of digits to round to.
* The icon can also be placed in the resources folder similar to the `strings.en` file. In addition, a markdown file with a documentation of these elements can be placed here. I hope the examples in the extensions folder are helpful (the `appId` of the pipeline element must match the folder name in the resources folder.
* The reason why we use a prefix here is that a pipeline element can have more than one input stream, where both streams provide fields with the same name. To uniquely identify a field, we use the selector. Since there is only one output stream, this is not needed when adding a new field to the event. You could also use the `updateFieldBySelector` method to update the field, and I think there is also a method like `getFieldNameOut` which should return the field name without selector.

This may be something wrong with the encoding when reading the file.

Do you have any ideas to solve this issue? Thanks!

## Description
When a user selectes the `FileReplayAdapter` with the configuration `Use current time: true` or `Replay Speed: Keep original time` and applies a `Timestamp conversion` e.g. ""2023-06-18 01:20:00"" -> ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"" the following errors occur:

```
ERROR 34003 --- [pool-5-thread-1] o.a.s.c.i.p.stream.FileReplayAdapter : The timestamp field is not a unix timestamp in ms. Value: 2023-06-18 01:20:00
...
ERROR 34003 --- [pool-5-thread-1] e.m.c.a.p.t.v.TimestampTranformationRule : java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: ""1687325253093""
```

## Problem
The problem is that the the timestamp conversion from `String` to `Long` happens in the preprocessing rules of the adapter which are executed after the event is processed in the adapter.
In this case however the adapter already requires the timestamp value, because it is needed to publish the events in the correct frequency.

## How to reproduce
Use the following csv and create a File Stream Adapter.
```
timestamp,value
""2023-06-18 01:20:00"",1.1
```

Currently only a limited number of data types are supported for the `PLC4X S7` adapter. This should be extended to support all data types that PLC4X offers.

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes and ideally (but necessarily) have some experience with PLC4X.

### What happened?

Hi,

When creating and an MQTT adapter, I can have the schema recognized, but the MQTT adapter would not start. This is SP 0.92.0

### How to reproduce?

I create a new MQTT adapter

### Expected behavior

Expected behavior is Adapter to be successfully created and started.

### Additional technical information

SP 0.92.0 runs in docker compose on an Ubuntu host ; browser is Chrome on a Mac

thanks to your detailed error description, I already have a suspicion what your problem is.
Within the the third step of the adapter creation (`Configure fields`) , a warning with respect to the timestamp is shown. Did you resolve that?
If not, this may be the root cause. Please ensure that the timestamp field is configured as such:
<img width=""716"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/50115603/8cab243b-1e72-490b-88fe-7ad211d23d2c"">

Then the timestamp field should look like the following:
<img width=""1245"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/50115603/bf80c7da-2d3a-48b6-a1b9-0f8c41d0d2a5"">

Alternatively, you can also simply add a pre-configured timestamp field by clicking the <kbd>ADD TIMESTAMP</kbd> button. Please do not forget to adapt the field name to avoid a duplicate field name.

Hope this helps 🙂 ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5hG9ZM/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thank you for your kind response. As a matter of facts I forgot to include
the screenshot for the timestamp resolution. Yes, I had resolved it
(otherwise, I guess that I could not have validated the creation of the

I am not quite sure what the problem is because your configuration looks good. And as you stated, when the schema is guessed correctly the docker container running the adapter should work as expected.
Did you change anything in the schema configuration (e.g. remove a property)?
Is it possible that the event schema of the events on this topic changes?
Did you try to restart StreamPipes by stopping all docker containers and starting them again?

Yes, I tried many things ; restarting just the backend, restarting the
adapter-iiot, restarting everything...
The event schema does not change. It is streamed by a SP instance with the
MQTT Publisher btw.

I tried to reproduce the problem with StreamPipes (0.92.0).
For this I started a StreamPipes instance with an additional Mosquitto MQTT broker.
I created a pipeline to write to MQTT and an adapter that subscribes to this topic. Unfortunately, I could not reproduce the error.
Can you please provide the logs for the `extensions-all-jvm` container? This is the container where the adapter instance is started, maybe this will give a hint what is going wrong.

Several dependencies of `streampipes-service-core` rely directly on the various supported protocols such as Nats, MQTT, Kafka, Pulsar.  Similar to extensions services, we should remove direct dependencies to `streampipes-messaging-*` protocols and instead register supported protocols in the `streampipes-service-core` startup configuration.
This will allow us to build core services that support only a single supported protocol, leading to smaller JAR sizes and removal of unnecessary dependencies.

Add an endpoint to the REST API that returns a list of registered userIds and their usernames.
The endpoint should be restricted to registered users.

This is a prerequisite for improvements of the notifications component (#1533), so that users will be able to target notifications to other users.

### What happened?

In the jvm processor archetype class `ExampleGenericAdapter` and `ExampleSpecificAdapter` are used [1]. 
But I could not find the declearaton of this classes in the sourcecode.

I thik this is possibly a bug.

[[1] ExampleGenericAdapter usage](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/2a49d0227cbc9af7366599b3b6c877f899fb0033/archetypes/streampipes-archetype-extensions-jvm/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/src/main/java/Init.java#L57)

### How to reproduce?

Create a processor with the current java archetype.
E.g.
`
mvn archetype:generate \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.streampipes \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=streampipes-archetype-extensions-jvm \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.93.0-SNAPSHOT \
 -DgroupId=com.example.test \

With this permission it is possible to access the dashboard without login, e.g. with the standalone link (/standalone/sp:dashboardmodel:...)

But the data are not shown because the measurement API requires an authentication. (/streampipes-backend/api/v4/datalake/measurements/)

A user should have the ability parse datetime values from string values in a pipeline. Therefore, a new processor is required that provides the functionality to convert a string value to a datetime value based on a given string format.

### Example Configuration
`DatetimeFormat` : A format string that describes the format of the datetime string

The datetime format should be configurable with a conveniant UI dialog, ideally similar to the our [Notification sink](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/dev/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-sinks-internal-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/sinks/internal/jvm/notification/NotificationProducer.java):

thanks for your interest in contributing here 🙏🏼 
Don't worry, we are happy to assist you and guide you through your first steps on GitHub.

One important thing is the git flow for open source projects: https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/
Please read through this to know how you can open a PR in our repository.

Since this issue involves introducing a new pipeline element, the following tutorial might be relevant for you: https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/extend-tutorial-data-processors
There might be some parts that are not completely up to date, we already have this on our radar. But if you face any issues, we are ready to help 🙂 

Since you asked, where to place the new processing element in our repo, I'd recommend you choose `streampipes-processors-transformation-jvm`: https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/eccb29ff437ea5c560d16bbf86e95e7f1011502f/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-processors-transformation-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/processors/transformation/jvm/processor

Yes, that's probably the only thing we need 🙂 When writing this issue I thought way too complex, so I really liked your proposal.
The only aspect we need to pay attention to is the target time zone. Your snippet would just use the timezone of the JVM where the processor is running, right?

The setup should work out of the box - here is a short description what I do when developing a pipeline element:
* Stop the `docker-compose` instance of the basic installation (you might also consider to clean this instance by executing `docker-compose down -v`.
* To set up the development environment, go to `installer/cli`, configure a template (`./streampipes env --set pipeline-element`) and run `./streampipes up -d`.
* You should then have a running StreamPipes instance including the UI with backend ports which are configured for local development.
* When you open the IDE of your choice, create a new pipeline element and execute the `Init` method (e.g., try with the `extensions-all-jvm` module. Here is the place where you need to configure the environment variables as startup env variables (`SP_DEBUG` and `SP_CONSUL_HOST`). This will internally configure the extensions service for local development.

* If you have any problems, you can check the logs of the extensions service (there should be a log message which shows where the system tries to connect to the core to register pipeline elements). 

Hope this helps! Please ask if anything is unclear.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5mOtO3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### How to reproduce?

### Expected behavior

_No response_

### Additional technical information

From the log, we can see that the Pulsar client already thrown the exception as SpRuntimeException to the StreamPipes. But I'm curious why it couldn't fail the adapter creation.

### Description
A user should have the ability to apply operations on datetime values (adding & subtracting time deltas, e.g., one day). Therefore, a new processor is required that provides the functionality to apply operations to a datetime object.

`Operation`: Allowed values: `add` & `substract`
`delta` : time delta, e.g. 1 day or 2 minutes (probably this needs to be split into two input parameters)

### Additional Functionality
If you have any other ideas for the functionality of this new processor, please feel free to add them here.

### Mentoring
As this issue is marked as a good first issue: one of @dominikriemer, @tenthe, or @bossenti are happy to provide help for getting started, just tag (one of) them if you want to start working on this issue and need some help.
This issue is ideal for people that are interested in getting started with StreamPipes and its SDK.

Currently, we use three different frameworks in StreamPipes to create visualizations in the data explorer and in the dashboard (plotly, echarts and one I can't remember yet). In the midterm, we should try to consolidate and focus on one framework here

In StreamPipes connect's schema editor, users can assign a measurement unit to a field. The list of measurement unit is currently unordered, making it hard for users to find an appropriate unit.
The list should be sorted by name.

In the schema editor of StreamPipes connect, form fields are not properly validated. E.g., when users configure a value transformation (such as multiplying a value by x), a value such as `0,1` is affected, but we expect a dot style like `0.1`.

Also, when applying a transformation rule which e.g. results in a floating-point value and the field is defined as integer, the datatype doesn't change.

dev (current development state)

### Affected StreamPipes components

UI

### What happened?

As [discussed](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/discussions/1872), this isn't really a bug but is a very confusing default setting. I'll paste that discussion here:

I modified the Property Scope of **BooleanOperatorProcessor** from PropertyScope.NONE to PropertyScope.MEASUREMENT_PROPERTY:
![e0d8a1f72a0936a0a38a1a77a08fd0c](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/76769570/690652c7-aeb2-4797-af76-9c077bdf28be)
So now b4, whose Property Scope is PROPERTY_SCOPE.HEADER_PROPERTY, is not shown in the UI:
![80b4a16200255c673f81afbdede7e22](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/76769570/3d4f7e09-3d21-4926-82fb-d7fd9ecfbbf0)
But its value is always **true**:
![d0b42b32f7a8a91437c2dd723376706](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/76769570/a4dbbbca-07ef-4d97-bdbf-df5aa273e3b7)
After I clicked `SELECT ALL` in the UI and connected to a DataLake, the result is:
![dca3d141ff4db8f6b1806c0460e1e05](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/76769570/b2a51e62-eaf6-47f2-a6ca-eca41208877d)
Clearly this is not what I expected since the UI only shows b0, b1, and b2. However, it seems that the result takes into account of b4. As evident not only by the above picture but also my debug message that prints all input streams:
![1693950191187](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/76769570/3c673bf5-d19c-49f0-8989-e6f043abb96f)
However, if I didn't click `SELECT ALL` but instead clicked b0, b1, and b2 one by one, the result becomes correct:
![a614bdecdddeeecca9687304d913165](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/76769570/add51311-a96d-4d1f-90a1-84fe7dc56037)

### How to reproduce?

Requirements:

1. Any processor that uses Nary Property Mapping (so that there's a `SELECT ALL` button in the UI)
2. Property Scope set to anything that is NOT PropertyScope.NONE
3. There exists a property in the input stream that satisfies EpRequirements but is not the same Property Scope as in the code
4. Click `SELECT ALL` in the UI

Currently there's no processor that satisfies both 1 and 2, but one can easily modify Property Scope to achieve this.

### Expected behavior

For NaryMappingProperty, `Show only recommended` should be default to false.

### Additional technical information

I originally thought a simple one line change is going to work, but unfortunately that is not the case. If I only change line 46 of [static-mapping-nary.component.html](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/312b55bb978d67ebbe65e3746a5345b579ac6da5/ui/src/app/core-ui/static-properties/static-mapping-nary/static-mapping-nary.component.html#L46) either by hardcoding a false value or adding a variable in [abstract-static-property.ts](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/312b55bb978d67ebbe65e3746a5345b579ac6da5/ui/src/app/core-ui/static-properties/base/abstract-static-property.ts), b4 is indeed shown but the `Show only recommended` slider is still slided to the right, causing an inconsistency:
![1694072603617](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/76769570/7dd3231b-f05d-424a-9d00-56542d94530f)
Therefore, I believe a new file/change in [display-recommeded.pipe.ts](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/312b55bb978d67ebbe65e3746a5345b579ac6da5/ui/src/app/core-ui/static-properties/filter/display-recommended.pipe.ts) is necessary. Since this file is used by all static properties. I am thinking about creating a new file like ""nary-display-recommended.pipe.ts"" and then modify all relevant files.

I am not sure if the above approach will work as I don't have the time to experiment yet, but I feel that this is a non-extensible hotfix. Is there a better way to do this?

I have made a [PR](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/1981) that should make default selection and selectAll match show only recommended setting. For example, if the user toggles the `Show Only Recommended` slider to the right, then `SELECT ALL` will only select the properties whose property scope is the same as desired property scope (this is also true for the default selection since `Show Only Recommended` is default slided to the right). Otherwise, `SELECT ALL` will select all available properties. Basically the UI and the backend are in sync now. The result of my particular problem also changed to the expected behavior:

- Does the directory structure seem good? Since no one has written any unit tests for module `streampipes-processors-filters-jvm` yet, I followed the directory structure convention of module `streampipes-processors-transformation-jvm` and created some new packages. I am not sure so please let me know the correct directory structure.
- In order to test all filter processors, one needs to be able to tell the number of events being filtered. However, because SpOutputCollector is just an interface, one must define a class that implements the interface so that he can get the number of events. I followed the class in [this test](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/ca4e0c2d44c1a713caaee3e9c1bff46096f41c53/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-processors-transformation-jvm/src/test/java/org/apache/streampipes/processors/transformation/jvm/processor/value/change/TestChangedValueDetectionProcessor.java) and I think other developers implementing unit tests for filter processors will probably do the same. Do you think it's a good idea to extract this class to make it commonly usable?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5o6k6G/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The structure you have created is totally fine and exactly what I would have expected

Yes, this would be great! How about putting it into `streampipes-test-utils` creating a package called `org.apache.streampipes.test.extensions.api`?

In StreamPipes Connect, the Modbus adapter currently does not return a preview of the incoming event.
This can be added by adding an `EventPreview` to the `GuessSchema`  object returned in the `onSchemaRequested` method of `Plc4XModbusAdapter`.

Users should not be able to delete adapters which are used by an existing pipeline.
The current dialog prevents deletion of such adapters, but has some drawbacks:
- [x] There is no hint to the name of the pipeline which uses the adapter, just the number
https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/2070
- [x] From a usability point of view, it would be better to ask users if the related pipelines should be deleted as well. In this case, adapters and pipelines can be deleted with a single click without needing to navigate to the pipeline view, find the right pipeline, delete the pipeline, and go back to the adapter view.
https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/2070
- [x] It is possible that the user who owns an adapter has shared the adapter with other users and the adapter owner does not have access rights to this pipeline. Pipelines that are created by other users using the adapter should not be deleted, in this case an error message should appear.

You should be able to do so by following these steps:

1. `streampipes down`
2. `streampipes env --set basic`: This setup only runs the prerequisites of StreamPipes, e.g., the message broker

### What happened?

Hello, when I install the StreamPipes Python client using the command `pip install streampipes`, I encounter a runtime error with the following message:
```PydanticUserError: `regex` is removed. use `pattern` instead```

This error is due to the incompatibility between versions 1.x and 2.x of pydantic.

Is this still an issue or will it be resolved in the next release with [ this line](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/f44f50307f9c62552f1ec90a3a155fb40ab242fa/streampipes-client-python/pyproject.toml#L60)?

Hi, I updated between two 0.93.0-SNAPSHOT versions and realized that I get a NPE during the execution of ConsulConfigMigration in the latest version. It is searching for a SP_PULSAR_URL entry in Consul and if it does not exists the backend terminates.
Adding a  SP_PULSAR_URL entry to Consul is a quick hack.

Currently, it is quite hard to modify existing adapters:
* Adapters can only be edited if no pipeline that uses the data stream is available
* There are several bugs when opening the adapter modification view (e.g., timestamps are duplicated)
* For users, it is quite time-consuming (and frustrating) to delete and re-create all existing pipelines even if the modified adapters doesn't remove existing fields.

To allow convenient modification of adapters, we need to migrate existing resources that depend on an already existing adapter:
* Pipelines need to be re-validated and updated
* Data Lake Measures, used in dashboards and data views, need to be re-validated and updated
* Adapters need to be checked for obsolete transformation rules after modification

In case an adapter is modified which doesn't affect existing resources, all resources should be auto-migrated.
In case an adapter is modified and a dependent resource will break (e.g., a pipeline uses a field that is removed in the adapter), the resource should be flagged for manual investigation/migration.

0.92.0

### Affected StreamPipes components

Backend, Connect, Processing Elements

### What happened?

After failing to get the pipelines to show up through the developer tutorial, I decided to follow the user tutorial in YouTube. Here is the first YouTube video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80TlDLH8ayY&t=317s&ab_channel=YaserAliHusen. I would say the problem is severe because the user would not be able start tracking any real-time data. 

I downloaded the Apache Streampipes from the website. I then launched docker as the Youtube video says. Afterwards, I went to the installer/compose folder to launch the program (docker-compose up -d) . Upon navigating to port 80 and going to Install Pipeline Elements, the search for pipeline elements never ends. This also happens to be the same problem that I had when I tried through the developer tutorial at this website: https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/extend-cli/

At the moment, I am a little stumped because the project is new to me. I also am unable to work on one of the issues because I would be unable to test the code. I was able to see that the server was returning an error code with number 500. I found a consistent error through Docker Desktop in the Streampipe service titled, ""streampipes-extensions-all-jvm-1"". Here is the error:

I am not entirely sure what it means, but I think this may help whoever is more knowledgeable than I to reproduce the error. 
Thanks everyone.

After this, errors were thrown. I believe that the backend should point to localhost, as I am not sure what the current address is. I think I saw on the cli that this was a common issue and that I need to manually change the ip address. I will look into the manual to see what I need to do. Any advise in the meantime would also be appreciated.

I'm not 100% sure what's the reason for the error you get, but it seems the extensions service uses a wrong hostname to connect to the backend. 
I would suggest that you stop StreamPipes, clean the volumes (to make sure there is no clash between the CLI version and the docker-compose version since the CLI overrides some environment variables) and then try to start the plain docker-compose at first. This shouldn't cause any problem.

If you still get an error, I would suggest to check the registered IPs of the core and extensions service in Consul (check the UI running on port 8500). 
I'm pretty sure we can get this resolved, sorry for the problems ;-)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5oKNoq/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks for responding. I am still having the problem. I used mvn clean on the eclipse development version, I also deleted that version from my hard drive and reinstalled it. Then for the 0.92.0 version, I fully stopped all the containers with docker-compose down. I even verified that the containers were down with docker desktop. Unfortunately, the problem is still there: the install pipeline elements will not load. 

On my computer, the Consul is not on port 8500. I tried looking at netstat (with the options) to see if anything was running there, but nothing was running on port 8500. Surprisingly, with the command ""netstat -a -n -o"", I saw that a program with a name ""com.docker.backend.exe"" was running on two ports: (1) [0.0.0.0]:80 and (2) [172.0.0.1]:6443.  I checked the logs for Consul, and I found the following at the start:

I'm unfortunately still unsure what causes the error...I would advice the following for troubleshooting:
* When you clean the initial version, did you also remove all volumes? Maybe it's worth trying to run `docker-compose down -v` and then check if there is no volume present with `docker volume ls`.
* If the problem reoccurs after restarting StreamPipes (the logs of `streampipes-backend` should show some log output referring to the initial setup), I'd suggest to check if the individual containers can communicate in the Docker network.
* For that, you can attach to e.g., the extensions container and check if you can ping the backend container.

I hope this helps us to further track down the problem.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5okvzN/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently a user can not read arrays from an S7 PLC.

## Reason

In the current implementation, a user cannot read PLC values as arrays because the option is not provided through the GUI.  
In PLC4X this can be done by appending the array information to the address configuration.  
Since we concatenate the `Data-Type` (selected in a drop-down) to the `Start-Address` in the code, a user has no way to provide this information in the GUI.  
Here is an example for an array: `%{Memory-Area}{Start-Address}:{Data-Type}[{array-size}]`.

## Open Questions

### How can we support arrays for each data type?
#### Possible solution:
For basic types we can use an array of this type.
**Sample event:**
```
{
'number': [1,2,3],
'string': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
'bool': [true, false, true]
}
```

### How is the user option displayed in the GUI?
Add a block of code where the user can add a new line for a new variable.
On the left is the variable name and on the right is the PLC4X S7 address.

**Sample:**
```
# VariableName=%{Memory-Area}{start-address}:{Data-Type}[{array-size}]
temperature=%DB3.DB0.0[BOOL]
```

### What happened?


StreamPipes 0.93.0-SNAPSHOT has new attributes to configure a Kafka source like ""Auto Offest Reset"". If the configuration was created in 0.92.0 this attributes could not be accessed[1],  which leads to errors in the UI and during runtime. 

What do you think of the idea to use a default value if no other value is provided? If I see it correctly changing the value should still be possible.

Currently, no mechanism exists to update the configuration of pipeline elements. For instance, when a new configuration is added to an adapter or data processor, existing processors can stop working since the configuration of installed pipeline elements and pipelines which use these elements is broken.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The current implementation only allows modifications that affect the configuration of 
> an element. Changes that affect the event stream are out of scope for this iteration
> (see more at next steps).

This can be split into major parts:

- update description for new elements: adapter, processor, sinks
- update descriptions for existing elements: adapter, processor, sinks

### Rationale
As of now, a user cannot simply upgrade to a recent StreamPipes version if this version introduces changes in a pipeline element (adapter, processor, or sink). To create new instances of an affected pipeline element the user needs to update them first via the UI.
Secondly, existing instances of an affected pipeline element were required to be recreated manually.
Therefore, we now introduce so-called migrations to update both the descriptions used for new elements and the existing elements automatically in the background.

### General Approach

A developer is now enabled to define one or multiple `Migration` for a pipeline element.
Therefore, one of `AdapterMigrator`, `DataProcessorMigrator`, or `DataSinkMigrator` from `streampipes-extensions-api` needs to be implemented. In addition, the migration needs to be added to the service definition in the extensions model submitter, e.g., `AllExtensionsIIoTInit`.

From now on, the migration is fully automatically handled according to the following flow:

![image](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/50115603/da35738b-58bf-442b-bd94-d669ecfe6b89)


### Update Description for New Elements

For every migration that is sent from the extensions service to the core, the core does update the description of the corresponding element in the storage (couchDB). This is done by requesting the current configuration from the extensions service and overriding the existing one in the storage. This automatic update of all element descriptions makes the manual update in the UI redundant. Thus we can remove this functionality as an upcoming step.

### Update Descriptions for Existing Elements

For every migration that is sent from the extensions service to the core, the core checks if there are any existing elements that are affected by this migration. If so, the migration is requested by the extensions service which then executes the migration on behalf of the core.
In case this is successful, the core can simply update the configuration.
If not, we stop the corresponding pipeline element. For processors & sinks, the corresponding pipeline is even marked with ""needs attention"".
However, (at least for adapters) this is not yet the ideal solution for handling migration failures.

### Important Information

- The description of all pipeline elements is extended by an additional field `version` which needs to be provided in the future. However, we can make this change step by step since the version always defaults to `0`.
- The order in which a migration is registered at the service definition does not affect anything. The order of the migrations is always ensured so that the earliest migrations are always applied first.
- Before a migration is applied to an element, it is checked if this element needs the migration. So we don't need to worry about migrations being applied multiple times to the same element.

### Next steps 

The following steps need to be handled (at least) to fully support migrations at StreamPipes:

In the configuration view, the counts of data lake measurements are fetched asynchronously for all data lake measures. In deployments with many different measurements, many queries are sent from the UI to the core, leading to slow response times.

We should add a new endpoint to the core which allows to receive the count values for measurements all at once.

Since the version of ditto client that we use is really outdated (#2050), we should check & test if our [ditto sink](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/3a61b29916b53a5809760e7f59656c495eca6e43/streampipes-extensions/streampipes-sinks-databases-jvm/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/sinks/databases/jvm/ditto/DittoSink.java) still works. In addition, the client needs to be updated to the recent version and potential problems need to be fixed.

At multiple places in our codebase, we need to distinguish the different types of processing elements (adapter, data processors, and sinks) and other StreamPipes entities/concepts.

For this purpose, there are already some enums defined that try to model this consistently, e.g., `PeType` and `SpServiceTagPrefix`.
However, they are not really used consistently and have some intersections. In addition, we have some legacy identifiers like `sepa` hard-coded across our codebase.

This issue seeks towards a unification of the existing concepts and the removal of hard-coded references. 
A possible solution would be to introduce a joined enum in `streampipes-model` that supports also old/legacy values with a custom function. This allows us to replace hard-coded values step by step and in the end remove the legacy usage completely.

While StreamPipes can already send notifications, e.g., for password recovery, account registration and from data sinks, the used email template is currently static and can't be changed.
Admins should be able to configure the template so that e.g., colors and placeholders can be changed.

The email configuration in the settings view should be updated so that templates can be easily modified.

Currently, our measurement units are only defined in the [ui](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/a168786190952bd7f62f020fae2d2e90efb3bd14/ui/src/app/connect/services/unit-provider.service.ts).

StreamPipes allows the upload of files for various reasons. All uploaded files can be viewed in the module `File Management`.

Unfortunately, there is currently no way to download a file and inspect it, in case one wants to see what the file contains.
Therefore we should add a download action directly beneath the remove action for every file.

### Description:
The `streampipes-logging` module contains legacy code that should be removed. 

### Implementation Steps:
1. Replace `PeLogger` with `LoggerFactory.getLogger(ClassToBeLogged.class)` for default StreamPipes logging.

2. Verify that logging functionality remains intact.

3. Once `PeLogger` is not used anymore the module `streampipes-logging` can be removed.

This change aims to remove deprecated components and improve the codebase.

Within #2001 we introduced basic support for migrating pipeline elements.
There we only implemented a rather simple handling of failed migrations (simply stopping the corresponding elements).
This is not really user-friendly yet and should therefore be improved.

Within #2001 we introduced a basic support for migrating pipeline elements.
One corner case that was thereby neglected is the following:

Let's assume an existing StreamPipes instance has an adapter of type `AdapterA` that is still in version `0`. This StreamPipes has now updated to a new version that is far ahead of the current one and therefore only provides migrations for `AdapterA` from version `1` onwards.

As of now, this adapter instance is simply not recognized and the adapter is not usable anymore.
This case should also be handled properly, at least by logging it somewhere.

to your first question. I would say that the adapter should be stopped if it cannot be migrated. So if this has not been done yet, I would suggest implementing this.

Regarding the second question: I think it is good that it is logged.

However, the logs are not shown to the user in the UI, so it's not obvious to the user. 
It would be cool to have a similar mechanism in the adapter overview as we have for pipelines to indicate problems.
For adapters, the status currently only shows whether the adapter is running or not:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f1fc654-8e94-4d8c-a7e1-88a12a5f8105)

Pipelines have a health status (`PipelineHealthStatus`) which is used to indicate problems to the user, maybe we can do something similar for adapters here and indicate to the user that the migration has failed and some manual work needs to be done to fix it.

The UI code for the pipelines is in `PipelineOverviewComponent` and for the adapters `ExistingAdaptersComponent`. 

What do you think of this? If you are interested in implementing this, let me know, I can also try to help you if you have any problems.

Within https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/2001 we introduced basic support for migrating pipeline elements.
This makes the manual update of pipeline elements in the UI redundant.
Therefore, we can safely remove it.

One aspect that is not yet covered is the update of the corresponding assets (string values, documentation & icon) for adapters.
So we need to include the update of the assets in the migration process of an adapter at the core.

I agree with you that this kind of workaround should be avoided.

I would propose that we change the configuration of the InfluxSink such that it can only expect primitive fields.
In this case, the user is directly warned in the UI that the data stream is not suitable for being persisted in the influx storage.
However, this might cause some inconveniencies but is definitely better than the current state of just ignoring these fields. To slightly improve here, we could think about providing a hint somewhere in our documentation proposing workarounds for the user.

In addition, we need to think about how this affects the automatic pipeline creation in case the user selects `persist data` during the adapter creation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5rvR-o/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I agree we need a better solution for this. However, I am not quite sure yet what the best solution might be.

The current challenge is that simply removing properties removes the user's ability to persist them. On the other hand, using a special encoding for arrays and serializing them as strings raises concerns about the use of the data for downstream processes such as visualization.

To move forward, it would be beneficial to collectively define the user's goal when dealing with array data. I see two potential options:

**Option 1:** Enforce users to transform arrays into an alternative representation before storing the data.
**Option 2:** Modify the representation of an array to a string format for storage in Influx.

And as @bossenti stated, we need to consider the side effects on other functions (such as the automatic pipeline generation)

I'm open to both options but would also appreciate any additional ideas or insights you might have.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5rvr5w/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In my opinion, option 2 is better because users should definitely be able to store arrays. And I am willing to provide an implementation of array serialization/deserialization and modify downstream processes accordingly. However, this is a non-trivial task and may take some time. For now, we should let users know InfluxDB can only store primitive types when they have non-primitive types and are connecting to DataLake (such as when creating a pipeline or selecting `persist data`) so that they can at least expect that data to be lost.

I will first implement the reminder. Then, we should further break down the task ""support array in influx sink"" to multiple tasks/issues, after figuring out what downstream processes need to be modified (we can collect them in this thread).

Just generally, since this is a change that affects the end user directly (although only positively), I would really appreciate so see some documentation & and E2E test once the workaround is in place. That would be awesome 🙂 

With respect to the reminder: Please be aware that sinks (and processing elements as well) can define a `requiredStream` within their `declareConfig()` method.
Would be great if we could solve it this way. (Maybe you are already aware of it, but just to mention).
In this case, we would need to check how we handle the automatic pipeline creation.
Out of my thoughts, I would suggest stopping & flagging the pipeline and setting a corresponding notification within the pipeline.

I really like your systematic approach. 

When considering the implementation's complexity, I'm uncertain if Option 1 is easier to implement due to its broader impact on components like UI and pipeline creation. It might be simpler to change only the Data Lake sink, serializing arrays to strings. This way, users won't need to modify the data stream or receive notifications. 
For the serialization I would suggest a simple format e.g ""[1,2,3]"".

But if we don't give users some notifications, wouldn't it be the same situation right now? Currently the user is unaware of the data lost so @bossenti raised this issue. If I am not mistaken, are you suggesting directly start working on Option 2?

Please let me know if I am misunderstood something, but if the worry is about limiting/decreasing usability of Option 1, I would suggest this: instead of making changes that impact usability such as modifying `requiredStream` or stopping the pipeline created by `persist data`, we could simply just add a text saying something like ""NOTE: This will not affect pipeline creation but currently the visualization of non-primitive types is not supported."" in the `strings.en` of DataLake sink and the place where `persist data` is in. This way, the user is aware of the limitation, can expect the data lost, and are not hindered from creating the pipeline. Meanwhile, let me work on serialization and submit a PR together with the `strings.en` change so that we can open separate issues only relevant to the deserialization/visualization.

I see, I just realized after serializing the array to string the influx store will store it which will be displayed in the dashboard (as opposed to nothing) so the user will notice a difference between the current situation.

Within the File Management module in StreamPipes, one can directly assess the file type of each file.
<img width=""821"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/50115603/ac9c1f72-9cc5-4689-8e0c-2e404e52ccfb"">

Unfortunately, all file types are colored the same color. To provide a better overview and to distinguish different file types visually, every file type should have a different category.

Currently, we provide many different bundles of extensions as fat jars and docker images:
* Connect adapters
* Connect adapters IIoT
* Pipeline elements all jvm
* Extensions all jvm
* Extension IIoT jvm
* and more

We can harmonize these to ease the installation.

I suggest the following three ""flavors"" that we can offer in the standard installation:

* `extensions-all-jvm`: Includes all adapters and pipeline elements in the codebase, as well as support for all protocols (Kafka, JMS, Pulsar, MQTT, Nats)
* `extensions-all-iiot` Includes a subset of pipeline elements and adapters which are relevant for IIoT scenarios, e.g., excluding image processing and geo components and including support for all protocols
* `extensions-iiot-minimal`: A docker image minized for small image size with reduced dependencies, only relevant IIoT adapters and sinks, and only providing support for Nats as a broker.

This would allow us to also ship smaller installations so that first-time users don't need to wait too long when pulling all the docker images.

# Description
This issue is created to deprecate several outdated adapters in the streampipes-connect-adapters module in preparation for the upcoming release (version 0.93.0). Deprecating these adapters will pave the way for their removal in the subsequent release. The module currently contains adapters that are no longer maintained or relevant, and we aim to remove them to improve maintainability and reduce unnecessary bloat.

Currently, user input that is collected via the UI when configuring adapters & pipeline elements is not validated, e.g., for being an integer.
This can lead to frustration for the end user.
Therefore, we should try to build in validation for our static properties so that at least data types are validated automatically and maybe even additional validation criteria can be defined.

Currently query results retrieved from the time series storage are represented as a `SpQueryResult`. This class allows us to abstract from the underlying time-series database but introduces some parsing effort. Therefore, we should investigate if it's possible to adapt this class as such that the corresponding query can be executed with ORM capabilities.

Instead of starting the jar file in Docker with `java -jar`, we can use layered images with Spring Boot's `JarLauncher`.
This should reduce startup times a bit and reduce the download size when updating docker images.

The event is ""correct"" (""correct"" meaning key value pairs are the same with the file) in frontend, Kafka producer, and Kafka consumer.

The root cause is that ""name"" key in the file stream is a keyword of [Influx reserved keywords list](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/8bb9168c0e6e7e1770e1b9d1291978d75bd00890/streampipes-data-explorer-commons/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/dataexplorer/commons/influx/InfluxDbReservedKeywords.java) and Streampipes [sanitizes](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/8bb9168c0e6e7e1770e1b9d1291978d75bd00890/streampipes-data-explorer-commons/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/dataexplorer/commons/influx/InfluxNameSanitizer.java#L21) DataLake measure for those keys conflicting with Influx reserved keywords.

you are right, changing the column name makes it work.

As you said, sanitation should prevent naming conflicts and therefore rename the `name` column. But the expected outcome is then that the values are part of the DataLakeMeasure with the sanitized measure name, which doesn't seem to work here.

With `org.apache.streampipes.storage.couchdb.utils.Utils` we have a utils that collects a lot of functionality in one class and is not really testable.
We should redesing this class and split it up.

As of now, every file uploaded to StreamPipes receives a unique identifier.
While this is conveniant to handle multiple files with the same name, it has some drawbacks for document retrieval. One is, that it is not possible to query a file by its original name safely.
Furthermore, it might get confusing for users if there are, e.g., five files displayed with the same name.
Therefore, we should aim to use the file name as identifier.
But we need to consider here how we can allow the user to upload a file whose file name is already in use, e.g, by opening a dialog that allows to enter a new file name or proposes an adapted file name.

thank you very much for bringing your ideas in here!

I really like the idea of providing the option to delete the existing file.
As you already said, we would need to check carefully if this file is used anywhere.
In addition, access to files is exposed via the API so someone might rely on this file which we can't detect. But for this case, I would consider a friendly reminder in the UI as sufficient.

If we want to add the deletion feature (and I don't see a real show-stopper here), I'd propose doing it as a second step. This way the changes are smaller and more comprehensible.

I have one question on backward compatibility though:

Currently the `FileMetadata` class has an internal file name and an original file name and I plan to just merge them into one file name. However, this may cause negative effects on current processes because of backward compatibility. For example, the [delete](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/blob/cb07ea3590733709075e3f30b7b5210fe9d117d0/streampipes-pipeline-management/src/main/java/org/apache/streampipes/manager/file/FileManager.java#L84) functionality relies on the internal file name. After letting this delete function use the merged single file name, users will not be able to delete the old already existing files because they are not found since they use internal file names.

I propose 3 solutions:

1. Keep the internal file name, also let fetching/deleting/other processes keep relying on internal file name. Changes are **1)** when storing new files, just set internal file name to be the same as uploaded file name instead of random UUID and **2)** delete original file name and change all places using it (this is safe because no modification actions rely on original file name, but some import/export/preview that relies on original file name is going to fail) to use the new internal file name. This approach solves the issue of backward compatibility and later uploads will follow the expected behavior outlined in this issue. But this causes the storage to have some (already existing) files' internal file name set to random UUID and some (after this change) files' internal file name set to uploaded file name. Also, for those existing files, users will lose original file names and see a bunch of random UUIDs in the front end which is confusing.
2. Keep both internal file name, original file name, and don't touch any places using them. Only change is setting internal file name to original file name instead of random UUID. This causes no problems for users but the codebase looks really weird. Later developers may wonder why there's both an internal file name and an original file name since they are always the same (only looking at the code).
3. Make an announcement to users to let them delete existing files before a release. This is better technically but is going to cause troubles to users.

thank you for outlining the different options and discussing the pros and cons.
Since they all have a disadvantage, I would suggest a 4th option, with a combination of your solutions.

Perhaps you can provide a migration script (see [1]). With this we can update all entries to the new version. This should (hopefully) solve the backward compatibility issue.

Thanks for the reply! It sounds like we have a little bit different definition of **migration** here. Before this quoted reply, I thought by **migration** you mean in `FileMetadata` class, remove attributes `internalFilename` and `originalFilename`, then add a new attribute `filename` which represents the merged filename. However, after this reply, if I understand correctly, I think you might want to keep `internalFilename` and `originalFilename`. Then to avoid users to see/upload files of duplicate `originalFilename`, 
1. Modify REST endpoints and ui to disallow the upload of files with duplicate `originalFilename`.
2. For files already having duplicate `originalFilename`, initiate a **migration** to change their `originalFilename` to something else.

Either way, I think there are a lot of vague terms. Probably code explains better. I’ll submit a PR with my current understanding and we can always iterate on that :-)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs5tpn3c/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

#2300 is just a temporary PR so that everyone can see my current approach, for merging the `internalFilename` and `originalFilename`, I plan to achieve this by the migration too. I am not sure what will happen if I modify the `FileMetadata` class structure and then commit the update to CouchDB. I will check it out later. I propose #2300 first because

1. That at least allows users to see no duplicate `originalFilename` and the REST and UI change are necessary even after merging `internalFilename` and `originalFilename`.
2. I will be traveling around in the upcoming 3 weeks. So I might not be able to work until early January. I don't think I can finish the merging before my travel so I submitted #2300 as a temporary solution.

StreamPipes allows the creation so called assets. All assets can be viewed in the module `Assets`.

![image](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/50115603/ed1791b3-3107-48e9-bdd3-1cc2975a47d3)

Unfortunately, this view currently does not allow to download an asset directly.
Therefore we should add a download action directly beneath the remove action for every file.

Similar to #2074

### Affected StreamPipes components

UI

### What happened?

When selecting multiple files in the file management component to be uploaded, only the latest is really uploaded.

### How to reproduce?

Go to the file management module and click on `upload new file`.
Select multiple files in the upload dialog.

### Expected behavior

Either clearly indicate that only one file is allowed per upload by changing button labelings and the upload dialog or enable the upload of multiple files.

The endpoint in `org.apache.streampipes.rest.impl.ResetResource` currenlty does not delete users.
This endpoint is used for the automated e2e tests to remove clean up all StreamPipes resources before each test.

The endpoint should be extended to also remove resources and user accounts of other users that have been created. 
This ensures that each e2e test starts on a clean StreamPipes instance.

When setting the parameter `horizontalRendering` to `true` in the `requiredSingleValueSelection`, the selection is rendered as a dropdown menu instead of a radio button group in the UI.
Although, this is cool feature, the effect is hard to grasp from the parameter name and also not accessible from the documentation.
Therefore, we should investigate where and how `horizontalRendering` is used (both in the backend and in the UI) and rename the parameter where applicable and especially improve documentation.

## Current Behavior:

In the current version, the `Data Lake Sink` utilizes the `TimeSeriesStore` to write events to the time series storage (InfluxDB). When the `event schema` of the pipeline changes, the new `event schema` is stored for the pipeline.

In `DataExplorerSchemaManagement.createMeasurement`, it checks if there is already a schema for the measure name. If a schema exists, it gets updated; otherwise, a new entry is created.

## Proposed Enhancement:

Introduce a user-configurable option within the Data Lake Sink, presented as radio buttons, to choose between two schema management strategies:

- **Option 1 (Default):** Update the schema of the `DataLakeMeasure` when it changes.
    
- **Option 2:** Extend the existing event schema. This option should only append new and changing fields without removing existing ones.
    

This enhancement provides users with more flexibility in managing schema changes based on their specific requirements.
Especially users will be able to see old data in the `data explorer` even when the schema changed.

For authentication, we only support Bearer tokens and API user authentication. Since bearer token have an expiration date and Prometheus should be able to access this endpoint with long-living credentials, we should support HTTP basic authentication for the monitoring endpoint. Basic auth should be enabled for this endpoint only.

Although we moved to Spring Boot as base technology for all StreamPipes services, the REST interfaces are implemented in JAX-RS using Jersey. This causes conflicts with Spring and adds overhead.
For simplification reasons, we can refactor the REST interfaces to use Spring Web instead.

The class `DataExplorerSchemaManagement` has a method called `deleteMeasurementByName`.
There is a chance that our storage implementation for measurements provides the same functionality. Let's check if we replace/remove `deleteMeasurementByName()`

Currently, we have three notification sinks without the option to configure a silent period:

- OneSignalSink
- SlackSink
- TelegramSink

With https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/2311 we introduced the `StreamPipesNotificationSink` which provides this functionality for all notification sinks centrally.

The purpose of this issue is to adapt this class as the parent class for the above-mentioned sinks (same adaptions required as for the MS teams sink in #2311.
In addition, we need to implement a migration for these three sinks that adds the new config option for existing elements as well.
An example for such a migration can be found in this PR [#data lake](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/2263/files#diff-bfa48e11482b1ca1dadc56b9f16be57a923c7972d13bd2f709cf29903b36c715)

Currently, before executing data explorer queries, we perform a count query to get the expected number of results.
This makes queries over longer duration very slow since InfluxDB doesn't perform well on count queries.

By eliminating the count query before each query, we can gain significant performance improvements. To still show a warning message when a request returns too many events to be displayed in the browser, we can use the number of returned rows from the raw query.

In most cases, we use a custom `JacksonSerializer` to serialize and deserialize messages over the REST interfaces. This serializer adds class information to the serialized object.
In some cases, we don't want this kind of serialization and therefore want to support a default mapper.
It should be possible to select the serializer with an annotation for each RequestMapping, with our customized serializer as default.

**Feature Requirements:**
1. **Input Stream Compatibility:**
   The processing element should be capable of accepting any input stream, making it flexible and interoperable with various data sources.

2. **User-Defined Metadata Configuration:**
   Users should be able to define a collection of static properties. Each property should include the following information:
   - **Runtime Name:** Unique identifier for the property during runtime.
   - **Value:** The value associated with the property.
   - **Data Type:** The data type of the property value.

3. **Dynamic Output Strategy:**
   The processing element should dynamically resolve its output strategy based on the provided metadata. The output strategy should be determined at runtime.

4. **Event Processing:**
   For each input event received, the processing element should append fields according to the user-provided metadata configuration. The appended fields should reflect the specified runtime `name`, `value`, and `data type`. The final processed event should then be emitted by the processing element.

### Example Usage:

#### Consider a scenario where the user defines metadata as follows:
```csv
runtimeName,value,dataType
sensorType,temperature,string
temperature,5.5,float
```

#### Input Event
```json
{
  ""reading"": 25.5
}
```

#### Output Event
```json
{
  ""reading"": 25.5,
  ""sensorType"": ""temperature"",
  ""temperature"": 5.5
}
```

## Description

When a developer misconfigures the resource files for a processing element in StreamPipes, a `NullPointerException` is thrown during the generation of labels for the processing elements. This error occurs in the extensions service. The stack trace indicates that the issue originates in the `LabelGenerator` class of the `org.apache.streampipes.extensions.management.locales` package.

## Error Message
```
jakarta.servlet.ServletException: Request processing failed: java.lang.NullPointerException
...
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at java.base/java.io.Reader.<init>(Reader.java:168)
	at java.base/java.io.InputStreamReader.<init>(InputStreamReader.java:112)
	at org.apache.streampipes.extensions.management.locales.LabelGenerator.makeProperties(LabelGenerator.java:131)
...
```

## Steps to Reproduce
- Misconfigure the resource files for a processing element (e.g. resource directory name does not match processor id)
- Trigger the generation of labels for the processing elements (e.g. go to http://localhost:8090/)

## Expected Behavior
The system should provide a meaningful error message for the developer to see why the labels could not be generated for a given processor.

Both classes seem to provide similar (or even the same?) functionalities but to different extents and with different parametrization capabilities.
We should try to harmonize both classes and remove duplicated code.

Currently, the UI allows for the tutorial button to be clicked multiple times, which results in multiple tutorial windows being opened simultaneously.

### What do you want to report?

I am trying to setup streampipes. I followed the documentation from this website - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STREAMPIPES/Core
I did the following:
1. Cloned the github repository.
2. `git checkout dev`.
3. `cd installer/cli && ./streampipes env --set backend`.
4. `./streampipes up -d`
5. Opened the Poject in IDE (IntelliJ IDEA).
6. There are 2 run configurations:
    A. core
    B. StreamPipesCoreApplicationMinimal
7. I ran `core` configuration.
8. I can see that the application is running on port `8030` with context path '/streampipes-backend'.
9. I opened http://localhost:8030/streampipes-backend/ in the browser.
10. I am getting 401 Unauthorized (visible in network logs) and a Whitelabel error page.
11. I have tried some other paths as well which are listed in `UnauthenticatedInterfaces.java` file. But, I am getting the same error for all of them.

I see the following logs in the console repeating. But, I think they are not relevant to the problem:
```bash
2024-01-08T21:40:15.858+05:30  INFO 84218 --- [pool-3-thread-1] o.a.s.s.SpServiceDiscoveryCore           : Could not find any extensions services, retrying (1/3)

Assets are not removed from a StreamPipes instance when triggering the `ResetResource`.

### Context
- The issue is observed in the e2e test `createAsset.spec.ts`.
- Test retries fail consistently due to incomplete asset cleanup.
- Subsequent tests are affected as the system retains dangling assets after test failures.

### Desired Solution
- Ensure assets are properly removed during the `ResetResource` process.
- Modify `ResetManagement` to handle the removal of all assets associated with a user.

Normally, external networks should be reachable from the containers.

One ""common"" cause of this error could be a timeout when the MQTT-Adapter is trying to determine the event schema. This issue often occurs if no data are published during the schema-guessing phase.

When a user edits an adapter utilizing the `add timestamp` functionality, the adapter fails upon restarting.

Additionally, the live preview in the configuration step `Configure fields` displays `timestamp: {}` instead of an actual timestamp.

To resolve the issue, users must manually remove and reapply the timestamp.

**Expected behavior:**

The `add timestamp` rule should function properly post adapter edit, displaying the timestamp accurately.

What can be done to fix this error?

### How to reproduce?

Configure the mail settings under configuration / mail and send a test mail which is delivered.
Create a pipeline with a mqtt adapter and a email notification.
No email notifications are sent, an error can be seen in extensions-all-iiot

### Expected behavior

As far as I understand this is an internal request to /api/v2/mail which is failing. In our mail server we could also not see a connection attempt

### Affected StreamPipes components

Backend, UI

### What happened?

In version 0.95.0, the Nginx configuration could be generated based on a template file. 
However, this template file is not accessible in the filesystem if the underlying volume was previously used for another instance. 
As a result, Nginx fails to start due to the missing configuration.

Workaround:
A workaround for this issue is copy the missing template file to the correct location from a second locaton (/etc/opt/nginx/). 
This step is only necessary when migrating from version 0.93.0 to a newer version. 
It is advisable to remove this workaround after the release of version 0.95.0 to maintain cleaner code.

What do you think of this ideas?

Start StreamPipes 0.93.0 and than start 0.95.0-SNAPSHOT with the same volumes.

- Files are being cached within the extensions service as expected.
- However, when a user deletes a file (such as a file stream adapter), it's correctly removed from the backend but remains in the extensions service cache.
- Consequently, when a new file with the same name is uploaded, the extension service incorrectly uses the old cached file instead of the updated file.

This behavior is also the reason for the failing nightly e2e tests.

## Question
Uncertainty regarding the necessity of the parameter in `org.apache.streampipes.rest.impl.PipelineElementFile.getFile` after the changes in #2300.

Consider assessing if `isOriginalFilename` is still required and if the methods `FileManager.getFileByOriginalName` & `FileManager.getFile` can be streamlined accordingly.</div>","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/2529/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Due to the update from JUnit4 to JUnit5, we had to deactivate some tests that do not use the JUnit5 syntax for parameterized tests. Below you will find a list of these tests that should be migrated step by step.

To see an example, I have started to migrate a first test (see `TestBooleanFilterProcessor`).

If you are interested in working on one of the tests, please let us know and we will create an issue for each test and assign it to you.

Actually, I already mentioned that earlier: https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/2754#issuecomment-2069513982

Would you be interested to contribute to #2375 by adapting your migrated tests to the framework introduced there and help to improve it?

If not, we can merge the migrated tests that are not part of #2375. Otherwise, we would cause a lot of migration effort in #2375.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs57x4HM/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The PR also contains some examples how this approach can be applied, e.g., https://github.com/apache/streampipes/pull/2375/files#diff-49a3517e7b83d0021ebf95c11e120d451297aff1c3eea3aab3f43dc8042cf9f0

So the task now is to update your PRs accordingly. This includes updating your branch with the recent changes in the dev branch and change the implementation of the tests so that they use the above described approach. As @tenthe already said, this approach is not fixed yet, so if you have any feedback, improvements we are happy to hear and address them or you can directly improve the proposed approach.

Does that make it clearer? 🙂 ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs58lZ_I/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In the data explorer, the time series chart shows weird results in case data with higher frequency is shown, e.g., 10ms intervals.
In this case, Echarts doesn't properly recognize the time string returned by the query API.

Currently, there are multiple locations within the UI codebase responsible for generating random UI elements. These locations include:

- `AssetOverviewComponent`
- `UserDefinedOutputComponent`
- `CreateAssetComponent`
- `StaticPropertyUtil`
- `JsPlumb service`
- `EventSchemaComponent`
- `EventPropertyRowComponent`

Additionally, the library angular2-uuid is being utilized.

To enhance code coherence and eliminate dependency on the angular2-uuid library, the random UI generation functionality across these components needs to be harmonized.

There are different definitions for types and semantic types in the following UI code. The following classes should be harmonized:

- `core-services/semantic-type/semantic-type.service`
- `dashboard/sdk/model/datatypes`
- `connect/services/datatype.service`.

Additionally, the class `platform-services/src/lib/apis/semantic-types-rest.service` provides the functionality for auto-completion of semantic types by calling the backend to provide suggestions.

One open question is where we should place the type definitions. We could move them to the ""platform-services"" or ""core-services"".
Any thought on that?

Currently, we support only two PLC adapters provided by Apache PLC4X (S7 and Modbus). Both adapters only support a fraction of the configuration options PLC4X offers.

With the latest release, PLC4X has added a very cool functionality to retrieve metadata for all available drivers. We can make use of this feature by automatically creating adapters for all protocols supported by PLC4X and can also automatically generate all available configuration options per driver.

This will greatly enhance the number of protocols supported by StreamPipes, while at the same time reduce maintenance efforts since we don't need to manually specify adapter configurations.

This is required that the self registration is activated. Then StreamPipes tries to send an email to the new user asking for confirmation. If the Email server is configured wrongly, the email dispatching fails, the backend should return a 500 error code

## Content 
Currently, only reading PLC data via PLC4X is supported. However, users should also have the capability to write results from a Pipeline into a PLC.

## Open Points
- Clarify whether the sink should support writing one or multiple values in the PLC.
- Determine how to handle the various PLC types supported by PLC4X:
  - PR #2637 introduces auto-generation for adapters for different PLC types.
   - Decide whether one sink can cover all PLC types or if separate sinks are necessary.
 - Identify required user configurations for such a sink.

Currently, the number data type serves both as a data type and a semantic type, causing inconsistency across the code base.

The PR #2616 initiated some harmonization steps, but there are still dual definitions for the number type:
- One in `DataType` (`XSD:number`)
- One in `SemanticType` (`SO:number`)

I propose supporting number solely as a data type and eliminating its role as a semantic type. 
However, prior to making this change, it's crucial to assess which pipeline elements rely on number as a semantic type.

I pushed my changes to the branch apache:2374-provide-a-framework-to-easily-unit-test-processing-elements. I am having issues with moving the code to a different module. When I tried moving it to streampipes-test-utils I had errors with cyclic dependencies. I created a new module streampipes-test-utils-executors, but getting this  error:

All tests are working. I have identified 4 scenarios for the selector prefix:

1. Default. By default the prefix will be an empty string
2. SAME_PREFIX. Will use s0 for all events
3. ALTERNATE. Will alternate between s0 and s1
4. Custom. Accepts a list of prefixes that will be iterated over during event generation.

I have created an issue to fix the test `TestSizeMeasureProcessor`. If you comment on this issue, I can assign it to you.
Generally this issue is about to fix the test again, it is not necessary to use parameterized tests for that.

I suspect that the old test used these parameters:
```
/*
 249 bytes is the base size of an object when first tested.
 Allowing up to 250 bytes comparison error in case of inconsistent base sizes across platforms
*/
return Arrays.asList(new Object[][]{
  { BYTE_SIZE, 10240 - 249, 10240.0, 250.
  { KILOBYTE_SIZE, 10240 - 249, 10.0, 0.025},
  { MEGABYTE_SIZE, (1024 * 1024) - 249, 1.0, 0.0025}
});
 }

Sure. Feel free to perform any adjustments

Exactly

We do not have a strict naming convention for feature branches
In general you are free to call the branch as you like, but we suggest to use the `Create a branch` feature of GitHub","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs57Wiad/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In some cases,. when detaching and re-attaching pipeline elements to a source in the pipeline editor, the validation is not working as expected:
* Coloring of edges does not resemble the state of pipeline elements
* Configuration status icons don't change
* Validation is not triggered

Other StreamPipes version (please specify below)

### Affected StreamPipes components

Connect

### What happened?

Pipeline loosing connections between data processors and data sinks despite the fact that the pipeleine was running properly before edition.



### How to reproduce?

The problem occured once I tried to introduce a Trend Data Processor. After deleting the Trend block and reconnecting the blocks, I was able to save and run the pipeline but everytime I open it in edition mode, connections are lost. 

### Expected behavior

_No response_

### Additional technical information

_No response_

We try to replay a CSV file with a File Stream Adapter but it is not working properly. 

The target is to replay 1 row every 100ms, store the rsults in a Data Lake and publish in parallel the results to a websocket Sink.

It seems that csv files (we tried different CSV formats, delimiters and options) rows are processed for all lines immediately. 

In „Basic Settings“ „Replay Speed“ gives no change. Any changes in „Speed Up Factor“ result in the same result.

We tried to add a column with milliseconds and convert to DateNumber and mark it as TimeStamp but this was not working.

The UI is losing after saving several options such as: 
- Selected file
- Timestamp conversion options Milliseconds/Seconds 

There is no help available for this Adapter.

If a user deletes a nested property and its parent, it can cause a null pointer exception.

I already provided a test case, see below.

## Extend the test code
- **File:** deleteTransformationRule.spec.ts
- **Test:** Test delete nested properties
- **Add the following code to the bottom of the test:**

```
ConnectBtns.refreshSchema().click();

// Test to delete the parent property
ConnectEventSchemaUtils.deleteProperty('parent');
cy.dataCy('schema-preview-result-event')

## Problem Details
- The problem occurs in the `DeleteTransformationRule.applyTransformation`
  - The value event is null
- Another problem is in the `SupportsNestedTransformationRule.applyNested`
  - A copy of the child object is added to the event in line 45, but the child could also be null

## Issue: Remove Deprecated Quick Edit Functionality and Integrate Pipeline Editing

### Description
- **Module**: `pipeline-details`
- **Issue**: 
  - The `quick edit` functionality is outdated and broken.
  - This feature originates from a time when pipeline editing was unsupported.
  - The tab can be removed.

### Proposed Solution
- Remove the `quick edit` functionality from the `pipeline-details` module.
- Integrate the editing of running pipelines into the standard edit pipeline module.

### Impact
- Simplifies the user interface.
- Consolidates pipeline editing features into a single module.

## Description
The class `JsonLdSerializer` is a legacy name from when we used JSON-LD for serialization. To better reflect its current functionality, it should be renamed to `CouchDbJsonSerializer`.

## Task
Rename the class `JsonLdSerializer` to `CouchDbJsonSerializer`.

## Impact
Improves code readability and clarity regarding the class's purpose.

dev (current development state)

### Affected StreamPipes components

Connect

### What happened?

The creation of an new adapter (PLC4X S7 Basic) is working only once at the first try. 

### How to reproduce?

If all the parameters and the Tags are configured correctly, the preview for the ""Configure fields"" dialog is working. If the Adapter is then created and started, everything is fine. If the ""Back"" button is activated to get back to ""Settings"" or if a new adapter is going to be created, the error message ""Could not read plc"" is shown wehn you return to ""Configure fields"". The only way to create a new adapter, or edit the existing one is to delete the existing ones and restart the Streampipes.

### Expected behavior

New adapters, should be createable and existing ones should be editable.

### Additional technical information

It seems, that the connection of the first try is kept open and a new connection could not be established.

But then I tried it again and it seems that the error only _sometimes_ occurs. E.g., when clicking the refresh button in the schema editor, I sometimes get the `Could not read PLC` error and (sometimes after 3-5 times), everything works again.
Can you confirm this behaviour?

The logs show the error below which seems to be somehow related to apache/plc4x#1593 with a similar error message below.
@ottlukas @chrisdutz do you have any idea?

PR #2946 contains the latest code after I made some improvements but still has the same issue - the problem occurs in the `OneTimePlcRequestReader` class.

## Problem
If you edit the adapter and change the data type, the data will no longer be saved in InfluxDB.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Create an adapter with a temperature field as an integer and create a pipeline to store it in the data lake.
2. Change the data type of the temperature field to double.
3. An exception appears in the data lake sink because it tries to write into the same measurement ""temperature"" with two different data types.

If a user adjusts the event schema of an adapter, this is also updated in CouchDB, but the old data remains unchanged in InfluxDB.

## Problem
- Adding new properties or renaming a property works without issues.
- Changing the data type of a property causes a runtime error when writing the data, due to the column in the database having a different data type.

## Potential Solutions
- Migrate old entries in the database to match the new schema.
- Adapt the schema internally to prevent the issue. This requires checking for pipelines that write data to the DataLake when editing the adapter.

## Current Workaround for Users
- For now we will show a warning when the user changes the data type
- Change the name of the data type.
- Write data to a new measurement.

## Description
When a user tries to use the timestamp conversion in the event schema editor during the adapter creation, the timestamp is converted correctly in the live preview, but no events are emitted when the adapter is started.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the event schema editor for a new adapter.
2. Configure a timestamp conversion.
3. Observe the timestamp conversion in the live preview.
4. Start the adapter.

## Expected Result
Events should be emitted with the correctly converted timestamp.

## Actual Result
No events are emitted when the adapter is started.

## Note
There seems to be an end-to-end test for this feature, but it is currently deactivated: `adapter/rules/valueRules.ts`.

Currently, StreamPipes provides several links to the documentation in the UI (login page and profile menu).
To better support third-party production deployments, users should be able to configure StreamPipes to disable link visibility and to configure other links.

### Affected StreamPipes components

Processing Elements

### What happened?

When a MQTT adapter with a nested JSON data format is configured and  started, the data isn't accessible in the pipeline nor possible to visualize in Dashboard. 

Data schema configuration:

![Screenshot 2024-07-02 at 14 43 20](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/assets/174210337/47714744-f24a-4e89-bcb1-120db7f58204)


Live preview of the data:

Even using a pipeline element, such as javascript eval, we cannot access the properties of nested objects. 

When creating dashboard visualizations, it´s not possible to access values from nested object properties. 

### How to reproduce?

Create a MQTT adapter in Streampipes with nested JSON data. In the pipeline try to view (using live preview) or access atribute values in the pipeline. After creating and starting both the adapter and the pipeline, try visualize object property values in dashboard visualizations. 

### Expected behavior

In the pipeline access values from nested object attributes. 
In the Dashboard, access and visualize data using nested objects. 

### Additional technical information

Streampipes version - 0.95.0
On a dashboard, if we select the raw widget to display the message, the nested objects appear as java.util.map, which implies that they are passing through the pipeline , but we have no way of accessing the data.

thanks for opening this issue.

Nested structures are not completely supported in all StreamPipes components. However, you can flatten the events in the adapter, enabling you to move nested properties to the top level.

In the schema editor (as shown in your screenshot), you can drag and drop the entries to the top level, placing them next to the timestamp. As a result your event shoud look like this:

```
{
  ""eixo_1"": 4
  ""eixol posição"": 0.15,
  ""eixol_velocidade"": 17.1,
  ""eixol aceleração"": 1.6,
  ""eixo1_ temperatura"": 50.7
  ""timestamp"": 171992775938
}
```

If you encounter any issues during this process, please let us know. Additionally, we are planning to include a flatten feature in the adapter to assist you with this process in the future.

It is also possible to change the `runtime names` of your properties by clicking on `Edit field`.

Cheers,
Philipp

In cases where a StreamPipes instance is only accessible over a proxy, the Python client fails to retrieve resources.
We can add an option to add custom HTTP headers to all requests sent by the client.

## Description
Python functions that produce an event stream stop producing events when the function is started for the second time.

## Problem
The Python client creates a new topic for the broker producer without checking if the topic already exists on the backend.

## Description
Currently, new data streams can be created in Python and registered in the backend. However, problems arise if the data streams change after a function restart, such as changes to the data stream name or properties in the event schema.

## Expected Behavior
- The Python client should automatically handle changes to data streams if possible.
- If automatic handling is not possible, a warning should be displayed to the user.

## Proposed Solution
- Implement functionality similar to migration when changing adapters.
- Add necessary functions to the REST API, such as updating data streams (PUT).

**Description:**
The current unit test runner does not support checks for double values when asserting the equality of an event property in `ProcessingElementTestExecutor.run`.

**Idea:**
Provide rounding for event validation. Users should be able to define a rounding parameter in the expected output events to dynamically set this value.

**Example:**
```json
{
  ""PROPERTY_VALUE"": 1.0
}
```
```json
{
  ""PROPERTY_VALUE"": { ""value"": 1.0, ""rounding"": 0.001 }

thank you for reporting this error.
I tried to reproduce it, but unfortunately I could not.

I created an OPC UA adapter as you described and changed the runtime name. Then I edited the adapter again I started it, but everything worked as expected. Can you maybe describe what kind of node you selected or maybe I am doing something wrong.

For my test I used this test OPC UA container `mcr.microsoft.com/iotedge/opc-plc`. We also use this in the CLI. Below you can see my configuration. Did I do anything differently to you?

we conducted additional testing and discovered an issue with the renaming rule. 
This problem seems to have nothing to do with the OPC UA adapter, rather the name of the event property seems to be the problem.

### Issue Description:

The rename rules fail when a dot (.) is present in a name. This is because the dot is currently used as a delimiter for nested properties, leading to conflicts.

### Steps to Reproduce:
- Use the attached CSV file with the CSV adapter.
- Observe the issues that arise with the rename rules.

### Suggested Solution:
Develop a test using the provided CSV file to identify and resolve the issue.

Currently, running pipelines cannot be opened in the pipeline editor. Users should be able to modify an existing pipeline in the pipeline editor and pipelines should be automatically stopped and restarted in case a running pipeline is modified.

Currently, users must select nodes individually from the tree editor. 
While this method is efficient for navigating an OPC UA tree, it becomes cumbersome when dealing with large trees or when multiple nodes need to be selected. 
To improve usability, we propose adding an alternative input method, similar to the code editor in the PLC4X adapter, allowing users to input multiple nodes more efficiently.

## Description:

Currently, users have the ability to add nested structures to event data using the ""Add Nested"" button in the Connect interface. While it's important for users to have the option to modify and simplify event structures by making them more flat, there is little value in allowing the addition of new nested structures.

## Proposed Change:

- Remove the ""Add Nested"" button from the Connect interface.
- Ensure users can still modify existing event structures to flatten them as needed.

This change will simplify the interface and focus on the most valuable functionalities for users.

## Description
Following the changes made in PR #3152, the functionality to add static properties in the UI was removed. Additionally, the `CreateNestedRuleDescription` functionality was marked as deprecated.

## Proposed Action:

- After the release of version `0.97.0`, all code related to the deprecated static properties functionality, including `CreateNestedRuleDescription`, can be safely removed from the codebase.

This cleanup will help maintain the clarity and efficiency of the code by removing outdated elements.

## Feature Requirements

### Input Stream Compatibility
   The processing element should accept any input event.

### User-Defined Limit Configuration
   Users should be able to input four numeric values to define the control and warning limits for their quality control process. These limits include:
   - **Upper Control Limit (`upperControlLimit`)**
   - **Upper Warning Limit (`upperWarningLimit`)**
   - **Lower Warning Limit (`lowerWarningLimit`)**
   - **Lower Control Limit (`lowerControlLimit`)**

### Event Enrichment Strategy
   The processing element should enrich each incoming event with the user-defined limit values.

### Example Usage:

#### Consider a scenario where the user defines the following limit values:
- `upperControlLimit`: 80.0
- `upperWarningLimit`: 70.0
- `lowerWarningLimit`: 30.0
- `lowerControlLimit`: 20.0

#### Input Event
```json
{
  ""timestamp"": 1627891234,
  ""temperature"": 65.0
}
```

#### Output Event
```json
{
  ""timestamp"": 1627891234,
  ""temperature"": 65.0,
  ""upperControlLimit"": 80.0,
  ""upperWarningLimit"": 70.0,
  ""lowerWarningLimit"": 30.0,
  ""lowerControlLimit"": 20.0
}
```

**Feature Requirements:**
1. **Input Stream Compatibility:**
   The processing element should accept events containing fields with upper and lower limits for monitoring sensor values.

2. **User-Defined Mapping Properties:**
   Users must configure five mapping properties:
   - **Upper Control Limit**
   - **Upper Warning Limit** 
   - **Lower Warning Limit** 
   - **Lower Control Limit**
   - **Sensor Value**: The value to be monitored.

3. **Functionality:**
   The processing element will evaluate if the sensor value falls within the specified limits:
   - If the value is within the defined range, no event is emitted.
   - If the value is outside any limit, the processing element will emit an event with two additional fields:
     - **Alert Status** (`alertStatus`): Indicates if the event is a ""Warning"" or ""Alert.""
     - **Limit Breached** (`limitBreached`): Specifies which limit was breached, such as ""Upper Control Limit"" or ""Lower Warning Limit.""

### Example Usage:

#### Input Event
```json
{
  ""upperControlLimit"": 100,
  ""upperWarningLimit"": 90,
  ""lowerWarningLimit"": 10,
  ""lowerControlLimit"": 0,
  ""sensorValue"": 95
}
```

#### Output Event (if within limits)
*No event emitted*

#### Output Event (if outside limits)
```json
{
  ""upperControlLimit"": 100,
  ""upperWarningLimit"": 90,
  ""lowerWarningLimit"": 10,
  ""lowerControlLimit"": 0,
  ""sensorValue"": 105,
  ""alertStatus"": ""ALERT"",
  ""limitBreached"": ""UPPER_CONTROL_LIMITS""
}
```

## Issue Description
In the Data Explorer, when the event schema is edited (e.g., in a pipeline or an adapter), the widget configuration may break because the event schema is not updated.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a machine data simulator with the ""persist"" option enabled.
2. Create a data view.
3. Edit the event schema of the adapter (e.g., rename a property).
4. Choose the option to migrate pipelines.
5. Return to the data view.

**Expected Behavior:** The event schema in the data view should match the updated schema.
**Actual Behavior:** The event schema options in the data view may differ from the actual schema.

## Resolution Requirements
Before resolving this bug, it's crucial to determine how to address this issue, particularly in handling old data and the outdated schema.

## Problem Description
The `RuntimeResolvableTreeInputStaticProperty` currently stores the `latestFetchedNodes` and `nodes` fields to render the tree in the UI. For large OPC UA servers, these nodes can grow significantly in size, potentially causing performance issues.

## Requirement
The processing elements only requires the `selectedNodesInternalNames`field. The storage of `latestFetchedNodes` and `nodes` is unnecessary and should be avoided to prevent any negative impact on performance.

## Proposed Solution
To enhance performance, the `latestFetchedNodes` and `nodes` fields should not be stored. There are multiple options available to remove these values from storage, and the most suitable approach should be implemented.

## Description
The Cypress test `startAndEditOpcAdapters.spec.ts` fails during the editing of the OPC UA adapter.

## Problem
- Nodes in the `Browse` tab are not loaded when editing the adapter.
- The issue is traced to the `StaticRuntimeResolvableTreeInputComponent`.

## Root Cause
- The static property in `StaticRuntimeResolvableTreeInputComponent` depends on other properties that do not send their status as `completedStaticProperty`.
- This behavior can be observed in `BaseRuntimeResolvableInput.ngOnChanges`.

#Description

Currently, we support two options for implementing processing elements:

- **Recommended**: `IStreamPipesDataProcessor` (interface)
- **Legacy**: `StreamPipesDataProcessor` (abstract class)

Most internal processors still rely on the legacy `StreamPipesDataProcessor` class.

## Tasks

- [ ] Migrate the `StreamPipesDataProcessor` class to the new API (`IStreamPipesDataProcessor`).
- [ ] Migrate all processing elements to the new API.
- [ ] Remove the deprecated `StreamPipesDataProcessor` class after one release.

Currently, StreamPipes has two simple processors to perform math operations. 
We can add an additional processor to perform more advanced expressions using the Apache Commons JEXL library (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/index.html).
This will enable users to use fields from input stream as variables and perform more complex expressions from `java.lang.Math`.

Currently, adapters are mainly created over the UI using the adapter creation assistant in StreamPipes Connect.
In some cases, it can be useful to programmatically create adapters, e.g., in case an adapter contains many custom configurations which are rather time-consuming in the user interface.
Therefore, we should introduce an API which supports programmatic creation of adapters. The configuration should be less verbose than the current `AdapterDescription` so that developers can create new adapters more easily.

### What happened?

Hello,

I was using the transform to boolean processor when I got an issue in my code that seems to be a bug : 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2654fc16-07ed-4c93-84e7-2c99ed69d20c)
As you can see, the ""s0::"" appears twice in front of the ""newValue"" field.

### How to reproduce?

Just try to input a value in the _Transform to boolean processor_

### Expected behavior

Should output s0::myField.

### Additional technical information

After looking in the code, I noticed this comment.

The current default behaviour in the data lake sink is that all events are written to the underlying database. In some cases, it makes sense that only values that have changed are written. This should be possible through an additional configuration option in the data lake sink.

As we have an increasing number of pipeline elements which users can use in the pipeline editor, it becomes more complex to find appropriate pipeline elements for a specific task.
To ease the creation of pipelines, we can introduce `Pipeline Templates`, which can be stored in the database and reused in the pipeline editor. Templates consist of a combination of data processors and sinks and can be connected to available streams.
We can also use the new template concept to improve the creation of the `Persist` pipeline in the adapter creation view.

As a user, I want to provide a regex expression to transform string properties of an event in the adapter.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can input a valid regex pattern in the adapter configuration.
- The preprocessing pipeline applies the regex transformation to string values only.
- No changes are made to the property's metadata during the process.

## Technical Details:
- Implement the new rule in the adapter's preprocessing logic.
- Validate user input to ensure the regex is valid.
- Ensure the transformation affects only the string values, not the metadata of the property.

Currently, the OPC-UA adapter only sends complete events. In cases where a single field has a bad status code, the full event is discarded. There should be a configuration option which allows users to change this behaviour so that also incomplete events are sent.

### What happened?

I am publishing a data stream to Kafka for a live Kafka data source in Grafana.
As Streampipes Kafka Publisher publishes data stream fields in a topic in inconstant order, the colours of Grafana Time Series panel series are continuously changing.  

### How to reproduce?

create a pipeline with a data stream, a projection processor to select fields and remove timestamp. Connect it to a Kafka Publisher Data Sink. Define Topic Name, Use kafka default Kafka Broker and port 9092. Select ""Unauthenticated Plain"" option.
In Grafana, install Kafka Plugin and create a new Kafka connection using ""kafka:9092"" parameters. Create a new dashboard with a Time Series Panel. Add a query with Kafka Data Source with the same topic name as defined in SP Kafka Publisher Sink. 

### Expected behavior

I would expect to receive all data stream fields in the same order for every Kafka publishing.

Currently, there are multiple run configurations in IntelliJ, some of which are outdated. To streamline and simplify, I propose:

- Retaining only one configuration for the `core` service.
- Creating a single configuration for all `extensions`.
- Creating a single configuration for all `extensions-iiot`.

When the property scope is not provided in the event schema of the `add` query, its value is set to `null`. This causes issues when the created data stream is used by other components, such as the pipeline editor or data lake.

### What happened?

After restarting the stack via portainer or even after restart the host the state of adapters an pipelines is NOT the same as before. Some adapters are started, some not. Some adapters are shown as running but they don't! Some of the pipelines are started, some not. 


### How to reproduce?

run a stack and connect multiple adapters to OPC-UA. Use pipelines to store current tag data in data-lake. After restarting the stack (or the entire docker-host-machine) not all items will be written to the influxdb - you will need to stop/start all adapters / pipelines manually!

### Expected behavior

When the adapters / pipelines are running before restart they should become the same state (running / stopped) as before.

Docker / portainer on ubuntu 24.4 server

### What happened?

I am using Streampipes on a Raspberry Pi. The data source is an HTTP server adapter that captures data and forwards it via a REST Publisher (Data Sink) to a Flask endpoint running in the background on the Raspberry Pi.
Problem:
After a reboot of the Raspberry Pi, data no longer arrives at the Flask endpoint. However, if the pipeline is manually stopped and restarted, the data transmission works correctly again.


### How to reproduce?

1.	Reboot the Raspberry Pi.
2.	Data does not arrive at the Flask endpoint.
3.	Stop and restart the pipeline.
4.	Data transmission works again after restarting the pipeline.


### Expected behavior

The pipeline should continue functioning correctly after a Raspberry Pi reboot, without the need for a manual restart of the pipeline.

We are using this baseline with minor modifications:

I didn’t notice any depends_on related to the backend service in the extensions section of your file, but we will add it to test the setup.
In the backend service, the only depends_on we see is for CouchDB.

### How to reproduce?

Create two PLC4X-S7 Adapters and start the second one. The problem occurs when you try to launch the second adapter.

### Expected behavior

I expected that the 2nd adapter launches correctly like the 1st one.

### Additional technical information

Runs in Docker v27.3.1 (and Docker-Compose v1.25.0) inside a Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS VM

thank you for reporting this problem. This is indeed a strange behavior.
In general, it is possible to have multiple adapters of the same type, so I suspect there is a problem with your particular setup.

Is it possible to start only the second adapter?
Is the configuration of the two adapters somehow different?
Maybe you can also check the logs of the extension service that starts the adapter to see if there are any exceptions","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streampipes/issues/comments/IC_kwDOB8jZEs6VlTDc/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks for the quick response. 
The 1st adapter works well, I can turn it on and off whenever I want without errors. But when I try to activate the second one it goes into a timeout for about 60 seconds and it fails (When I try to activate the 2nd adapter it doesn't matter if the 1st adapter is activated or not, it just doesn't work). 

Is it possible to start only the second adapter? No
Is the configuration of the two adapters somehow different? No, I just use more variables in one than the other. In the first adapter I use 3 variables and a timestamp; in the second one I use one of those 3 variables that work in the 1st adapter and a timestamp (I have also tried with other variables but the result is the same). 

It get this exception (AdapterException):

Currently, environment variables for Cypress need to be added manually in the terminal or modified in package.json. Updating the scripts for test-cypress-open, test-cypress-smoke, and test-cypress-all to include these variables would streamline the workflow and make it more convenient for developers.

When a user creates a time series chart widget, it cannot be edited afterward.  

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Create a data view with a time series chart.  
2. Attempt to edit the chart.  
3. Observe that the configuration menu is broken.  

**Additional Observations:**  
- For other widgets, the configuration is not stored correctly.  
- The widget configuration always reverts to displaying a table.

### What happened?

The refresh interval settings in the dashboard toolbar are only visible if the global time settings are selected. In the case of widget time settings, the refresh interval disappears and leaves no option to change the settings.

Add widgets to the dashboard and de-select the option ""Use global time settings instead of widget time settings"". Then, open the dashboard.

### Description  
The `version` property in `docker-compose.yml` files is now considered obsolete as Docker Compose automatically applies the latest supported schema. Including the `version` property can lead to warnings like the following:  

```
WARN[0000] /path/to/compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion
```  

This issue proposes the removal of the `version` property from all Docker Compose files in the Apache StreamPipes project to align with modern Docker Compose practices and eliminate unnecessary warnings.

The variable name `measurementID` in the `dropMeasurementSeries` method of the `DataLakeManagementController` class is misleading. It represents `measureName`, not a measurement ID, causing potential confusion and inconsistency.

The Data Lake Sink update script fails during version upgrade. Upon upgrading, the configuration schema update appears twice in the Data Lake Sink.  

**Steps to Reproduce**  
1. Start StreamPipes version 0.95.1.  
2. Create a simple pipeline: Data Stream → Data Lake Sink.  
3. Stop StreamPipes.  
4. Start StreamPipes version 0.97.0-SNAPSHOT.  
5. Observe that the configuration schema update appears twice in the Data Lake Sink (see below).

dev (current development state)

### Affected StreamPipes components

UI

### What happened?

I am using the OPC UA Adapter to collect measurements from an OPC UA server. The SampleNodeIds of the measurements have the format S7-XXXX.YYYY.ZZZZ.

The adapter considers only the last part of the SampleNodeId (the ZZZZ section) for the ""Field runtime name"". This leads to problems when multiple measurements share the same ZZZZ value.

Example:
SampleNodeId 1: S7-1234.0102.0034 → Field runtime name: 0034
SampleNodeId 2: S7-1234.0105.0034 → Field runtime name: 0034

 In the next step, multiple measurements with the same runtime name are available, making it difficult to distinguish between them.

In the preview of the adapter, only one of the measurements is displayed, even though multiple measurements share the same ZZZZ component in their SampleNodeId. This makes it harder to verify the data and can lead to missing measurements.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891ccf60-4ae4-4054-9be1-b960dce03a40)

### How to reproduce?

- Configure the OPC UA Adapter to collect measurements with similar SampleNodeIds. Ensure that multiple SampleNodeIds have the same last part (ZZZZ) and click on ""Next"".
- verify the generated Field Runtime Names.
- View the preview of the collected measurements 

### Expected behavior

Unique Field Runtime Names: The adapter should generate a more unique Field Runtime Name, for example, by considering the entire SampleNodeId.
Complete Preview Display: The preview should display all measurements, even if they share the same ZZZZ value in their SampleNodeIds.

Filtering for numerical dimension properties in the data explorer is not functioning as expected.  

## Steps to Reproduce  
1. Load data into the data lake with at least one numerical dimension property.  
2. Create a data view and apply a filter on this property.  

### Actual Behavior  
- No results are displayed after applying the filter.  

### Expected Behavior  
- Results should be correctly filtered based on the applied criteria.

The methods `testAdapter`, `startAdapter` and `addAdapter` in the `ConnectUtils` class are highly similar in functionality. To improve maintainability and reduce redundancy, these methods should be reviewed and harmonized into a unified implementation where possible.

**Description:**  
The `spnet` network configuration includes a subnet definition that was originally added for Consul. Since Consul is no longer in use, this subnet can be removed to simplify the configuration.  

**Affected file(s):**  
- `docker-compose.yml`  

**Proposed fix:**  
Remove the following section from `docker-compose.yml`:  
```yaml
networks:
  spnet:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: ${SP_SUBNET}
```

Extend the static metadata enricher so that also an added field's label and description is added to the event schema. Currently, only `runtimeName`, `dataType` and `value` are supported.

The PLC4X adapters currently only allow specifying a data type (e.g., `STRING`) but does not support custom-length definitions like `STRING(10)`. This limitation prevents certain use cases where shorter strings or string arrays (e.g., `STRING(10)[3]`) are required. To ensure full compatibility with PLC4X and S7 address syntax, we should fix this problem.
