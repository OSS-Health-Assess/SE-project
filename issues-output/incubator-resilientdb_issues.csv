./resilientDB-docker --clients=2 --replicas=4
The ./resilientDB-docker fails because the ifconfig file is not created properly. The reason being, multiple clients are added in the same line separated by \n. There is a small bug in the docker-ifconfig.sh file.

How to run your code on more than 1 cluster? For now, if I use ``./resilientDB-docker --clients=1 --replicas=4`` then I have 1 cluster wit 4 replicas. But I want 2 clusters with 4 replicas in each. I think there must be some configuration to be done because ``./resilientDB-docker --clients=1 --replicas=8`` wont split the replicas in 2 clusters.

I'm not sure if this is an issue specifically with Docker or WSL2 itself? I'm new to using Docker so if you could point me to a good resource that would be great! Let me know if I'm missing any information to add to my issue.

Thanks.

Best, 
Alejandro

Second, a lot of the code connects to the containers and executes commands instead of putting a startscript in the Dockerfile which is then executed after startup. This makes a multi-machine setup with swarm very difficult.

To guarantee data consistency, these transactions are forced through the consensus layer to obtain the correct results. Due to the nature of consensus design, each transaction will be written to the chain and written to the disk to support durability and recovery.

To improve read-only transactions, we can explore alternative designs without the need to participate in consensus yet retrieve consistent results.  

Here are a set of important considerations:

1. How to identify read-only transactions?
2. Should a fee be paid to process read-only transactions, if so, then read-only transactions will require payment, which must pass through consensus.
3. How to ensure data consistency without engaging in consensus. Without consensus, each replica will return different data. How to verify the data is consistent? Could we introduce read-only caching services (e.g., Coordination-Free Byzantine Replication with Minimal Communication Costs, ICDT'20)? Can we relax the need to provide the latest data, instead maybe we can support snapshot reads, where each query from the same client returns the same version of the data, i.e., repeatable.

1. After the view change occurs, a replica does not continue the transaction it was performing when the view change occurred
2. After the view change occurs, a replica is unable to receive/recognize transaction messages being sent towards it

From testing, type 1 is most likely an issue with when the view change messages are received and occurs it interrupts some process which was midway and the program is unsure where to continue. This problem is fixed if start_kv_service.sh is reran, so is likely a runtime issue with timing

For type 2, this is most likely an issue with the ports or memory, as what I have noticed is when the view change runs into type 2, whenever I try a view change on that computer session following that, it always results in a type 2 error. Meanwhile, if the view change works fine the first time, all subsequent star_kv_service.sh runs for that computer session(when the code remains unchanged) avoid the type 2 issue.

Your LICENSE file lists 3rd party libraries. Those should not be in your LICENSE file. Projects sometimes have binary artifacts that they release with the source releases. These binary artifacts should have LICENSE files and they will typically have the standard Apache License plus a list of the 3rd party libs that are in the binary artifact with their license details. Many projects put this sort of info in a file called LICENSE-binary. ResilientDB does not appear to be releasing binary artifacts at the moment so this is not strictly needed. But the info is useful for people you download your source release because it tells them what to expect when they run the install script.

It is not ideal to include any binary files in a release of an Apache project. Reviewers will find them and start asking why they are there. You cannot include compiled artifacts in a source release so ASF contributors are looking for binary files to see if there is anything untoward.

I launched 5 AWS instances as nodes for resdb. While running the command:

to test performance, I encountered the following issue:

During the execution of the script, the client node suddenly disconnects, resulting in an incorrect number of nodes being counted when calculating the results.

I saw you used c5a.xlarge which only contains 8GB mem.
The memory is not enough as the performance tool suit will generate a large
amount of requests.

You can reduce the number of requests by changing the number here:
https://github.com/apache/incubator-resilientdb/blob/master/platform/consensus/ordering/pbft/performance_manager.cpp#L111
Like 60000000 to 2000000.

Hope this can help you.


Thanks,
Junchao
