To be honest, this generic support already exists and sometimes I'm using it for CodeSniffer.

It is also cumbersome to setup for PHP_CodeSniffer because the ""regular expression"" of the output pattern rule is hard to match with the generated report. I got it working for parts of the report, but if the error/warning message also contains digits (e.g. ""expected 4 spaces but found 1"") then Eclipse does not parse it correctly. Did you have more luck with it?

A great benefit of both PHP CS Fixer and PHP_CodeSniffer, is that they allow team members to share a single set of rules, independent of the editors they use. So any stable mechanism to display their reports as errors and warnings in Eclipse adds great value. I would also be very much in favour of integrating popular static analyzers like Phan and PHPStan.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzU2MDMyMA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You are right, there are no big differences between in PSR-2 and PSR-12, however it was missing and PSR-12 is the standard in many projects by now.

ATTENTION: In meanwhile I realised the guys at dolibarr have not sticked to the PSR-12 standard.
In their PSR-12 profile they use tab policy = tabs. According to PSR-12 it must be be 4 spaces.
(see https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/ at 2.4)
I edited the dolibarr profile in Eclipse and changed:
Tab policy: Spaces
Identation size: 4

I suggest to do the same for the PSR-12 profile in Eclipse, if you have not yet done so.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAFsa6c5Hllnm/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The template file has the corresponding, `Variable '$pageTitle' is undefined` error, so hopefully the fix would be reciprocal in this case.

**To Reproduce**
Enter the following into a PHP editor. Note that code completions, mouse over floating windows etcetera, for $this->one inside the ModTwo class constructor show $this->one as a One class instead of the expected ModOne class.

```php
<?php

     *
     * @var string
     */

    public function __construct() {
        //$this->one still seen as a One class by IDE when it should be seen as
        //a ModOne class. The type hint does not help.
        /* @var ModOne $this->one */
        $this->one = new ModOne();
    }
}

$x = new ModTwo();
var_dump($x->one); //Outputs correct ModOne object
```

**Steps to reproduce the behavior**
See previous section.

**Expected behavior**
1. PDT should treat the $this->one property inside the ModTwo class constructor as a ModOne class, not its parent One class.
2. If a type hint conflicts with what PDT thinks a variable is, the type hint should take precedence, which is why the type hint was added.

After upgrade to 2020-06 the javascript editor does not work anymore. Instead you can open a javascript source in the Eclipse general text editor which naturally lacks all the relevant features - syntax highlighting, outline, syntax validation, source formatting.

This is in contradiction with the PDT documentation that says that a javascript editor is included in the package.

In fact a stub of Javascript development tools seems to be installed but it has no content. In 2020-03 you can unfold the item but not in 2020-06.

This problem was reported here: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=564496 for JSDT and answered with: Standalone JS Editor is not provided anymore. That is a pretty useless answer if you just experienced that your javascript editor has gone missing. 

The current state of 2020-06 is that I am better off using Notepad++ with just syntax highlighting than using the generic text editor inside Eclipse. I was forced to revert to 2020-03, even with the serious DLTK bug that plagues that version.

I am now at a loss how to get back to a fully functioning javascript editor including syntax highlighting, outline, syntax validation, source formatting in combination with Eclipse PDT.

I'm not certain if this a bug of PDT itself or the Eclipse platform, nevertheless since 2020-03 and then still present in 2020-06 when I move, cut/paste or delete files in the project explorer, it doesn't refresh.

Another side effect is that when I double click on the moved file (which still appears with the old name) it fails in opening it (since the file doesn't exist) but with a unrelated message, and tries to open the system editor instead, which at its turn yells because the file does not exist.

1. Add a new PHP project
2. Right click on a PHP file in the explorer, then select ""Delete""
3. See that explorer view didn't refresh
4. Double click on the old name still there.

Now, only the part in `new Destinataire((string) $contact->id, $contact->email` is underlined as being an warning, the rest is fine.

So there are two bugs here:

- first, it works with PHP 8.2 parser, but not previous ones (although I didn't tested using PHP 8.1, this project is kind huge to validate),
- now that it works in 90% percent of use cases, there are still some pitfalls in 8.2 parser.

It's an extremely powerful feature and I would love to use it, yet it seems you cannot tell PDT which namespace to match in which folder (I might be wrong). I don't know how it deduces it, but it actually never matches real PSR-4 or PSR-0 configuration from my `composer.json` file, so considers that ALL my PHP files are at an invalid location.

 - Why isn't the composer support automatically enabled if a `composer.json` file is found?
 - A lot of projects I'm working on, `composer.json` file is in a sub-directory (i.e. `/app/composer.json` for example) will it still work?
 - It should probably be configurable in the project properties when `composer.json` file is absent or composer support isn't enabled?
 - The feature should probably be in a disabled state until configured.

Some auto-discovery works during import/create project but not always. There is a plan to finally build one simple project creation/update wizard but after I finish new model without some DLTK limitations.

As for now composer support have couple limitations:
1. composer.json have to be in root directory
2. composer editor always open with name as project, so if you open something from vendor you might be confused
3. problems with synchronisation between buildpath update / workspace refresh / composer.json / composer.lock
4. have own php launch implementation that sometimes giving me crazy

As for now I personally use it mostly for correct ""new class"" , ""validation"" and buildpath refresh. I personally not use our powerful composer.json editor in my daily work ;)

2. Otherways, scan all namespaces and look for constant (our cpu hog)
3. If not found try to resolve similar to scalar (just by name).

ConstantDeclarationEvaluator and ConstantDeclarationEvaluator logic have to be changed. I'm not sure if in this case inferencing is really necessary.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NjE0OTc0Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

And I write the following class:

```php
class TestDispatcher implements Dispatcher, \Countable, \IteratorAggregate
{
    // Methods are missing.
}
```

When I click on the ""Add unimplemented methods"" quickfix, methods are generated in something that looks like a random order, I end up with:

```php
class TestDispatcher implements Dispatcher, \Countable, \IteratorAggregate
{
    public function process($message, array $properties = [], bool $withTransaction = true): void

 - order of methods are not the same as the declaring interface,
 - methods from each interface are randomly mixed.

Ideal world would sort the generated methods in the (declaring interfaces order, interface method order). I would end up with this order:

```php

It's not a traumatizing behaviour, I generally just re-order methods manually by copy/pasting it, but I try, most of the time, to give some kind of meaning to method order in my interfaces, and like to implement them in order.

I am skeptical about that request, but at this time, it does not contain anything concrete which would solve or help with this issue, and even if it was realized in the proposed timeline, it could take 2 years to complete that replacement.

I will try to get more information about the foundation's plans, but in the meantime, one possibility would be to go back to bugs.eclipse.org and attempt a new migration when a migration path is created. Otherwise, indeed, all references to tracker(s) should point to both.

When calling
`preg_match_all($pattern, $string, $matches), `
...the third parameter stores the matches, but PDT signals the parameter as ""Variable '$matches' is undefined"", and after the statement, it is still considered as undefined, even if it should be considered defined from the call.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
Eclipse 2020-06, PDT 7.2

**Describe your system**
 - OS: Windows

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a PHP file which calls a function which accepts passing by reference such as preg_match_all(). For example, [Parsedown.php](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/blob/master/Parsedown.php#L1036).
2. Hover over the yellow warning

**Expected behavior**
No warning on the call. PDT should understand that the call defines the variable, or if it can't, warn that such warnings are unreliable.

Code navigation is not working in PHP Project from Compose Package. I create a new project from yiisoft/yii2-app-basic project, open a model file and try to click on `use Yii` with Ctrl. No effect.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
Eclipse Version: 2020-06 (4.16.0)
PDT 7.2.0.2020052718
No any extra plugins just Eclipse PHP downloaded from a site.

**Describe your system**
 - OS: Fedora
 - Version 31
 - PHP Version 7.3.20
 - Composer 1.10.9

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a new **PHP Project from Composer Package**. As a starting point use yiisoft/yii2-app-basic. Don't use existing location.
2. Open models->ContactForm.php file from project tree.
3. Click on `use Yii` with Ctrl.
4. See no effect.

**Expected behavior**
Opened Yii.php file in new tab.

**Additional context**
It works when I use the same yii project but downlod manually with composer. In this case I use just **PHP Project**. But in this case navigation only works in vendor dir. After I played with Build paths I can get navigation in *controllers/SiteController.php*, *models/ContactForm.php* and *models/User.php*. But still no code navigation in *models/LoginForm.php*. 

Also I can't find info which explains how to setup lookup of include files. I mean *.php file contains `use app\models\MyModel` for example. How PDT can know that `app` means project dir and it must load MyModel.php from /path/to/project/models/ dir?

P.S. I never used Eclipse before and just try to use IDE for php coding.

I think the culprit is https://github.com/eclipse/pdt/blob/4c8d7f9dfc7842ca40ebfdb7b1b902910344985d/plugins/org.eclipse.php.core/src/org/eclipse/php/internal/core/language/DefaultLanguageModelProvider.java - it has no case for PHP 7.4, and defaults to 7.3.

When starting a phpunit testcase with the environment variable XDEBUG_CONFIG=""idekey=ECLIPSE"" on a remote webserver some breakpoints are triggered, some are not.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
epp.package.php 4.17.0.20200910-1200

**Describe your system**
 - OS: macOS Catalina
 - Version 10.15.6
 - PHP Version 7.4.10
 - Webserver Version apache2 2.4.38-3+deb10u4
 - Utilis composer, PHPUnit 5.7.27, Xdebug 2.9.7

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Set a breakpoint in Eclipse project (/Users/me/Dev/myapp)
2. Set another breakpoint in one Eclipse project (/Users/me/Dev/nextcloud-server)
3. Start phpunit via ssh on webserver => Eclipse stop execution on Breakpoint 1, but not on Breakpoint 2
4. Check xdebug log on webserver => breakpoint_set for Breakpoint 2 contains local(macOS) path, not remote/webserver(Debian GNU/Linux 10 as docker container) path

**Expected behavior**
Eclipse PDT debug should translate local path to remote path when transmitting xdebug breakpoints so breakpoints can be hit

**Screenshots**

I tried Workspace and File system mappings too. Also no mappings at all seem to work as well

**Additional context**
Paths on webserver:
/var/www/html <- Breakpoints don't work in these files. If I add xdebug_break() code execution stops as expected.
/var/www/html/custom_apps/myapp <- Breakpoints work in these files as expected!

Eclipse Projects in workspace:
/Users/me/Dev/nextcloud-server (local mount of /var/www/html)
/Users/me/Dev/nextcloud-myapp (local mount of /var/www/html/custom_apps/myapp)

How I start phpunit:
```
www-data@d30abd6a29e5:/var/www/html/custom_apps/myapp$ XDEBUG_CONFIG=""idekey=ECLIPSE"" ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit -v
```

Executed test calls methods in two files:
/var/www/html/custom_apps/myapp/tests/Unit/Migration/MigrationTest.php <- Breakpoints work here
/var/www/html/lib/private/DB/MigrationService.php <- Breakpoints don't work here

```

Notice how in the above log two breakpoints are set with different paths:
```
[327] <- breakpoint_set -i 317 -t line -f file:///var/www/html/custom_apps/myapp/tests/Unit/Migration/MigrationTest.php -n 
...
[327] <- breakpoint_set -i 318 -t line -f file:///Users/me/Dev/nextcloud-server/lib/private/DB/MigrationService.php -n 413
```

**Workaround 1**
Don't use Eclipse to set breakpoints, edit files manually and insert ""xdebug_break();""

**Workaround 2**
Create the same absolute filepaths as on the webserver so that Eclipse doesn't have to map any paths:

And also, are you are parsing types using the `Identifier` class, but with union type, you'll need to a case in the `type::` grammar, case in which you'll need to parse an `IdentifierList` or some sort, I started reading the code, they are thousands of references of the `Identifier` class, seems hard to grasp where you use it for types and where you use it for other expressions, are you planning on specializing a bit more parsed tokens in the AST ?

That's what I thought when I saw your current parser, I guess union types is the most invasive change, you'll need to adapt your AST too, if not for performance, at least it must be done for maintainability.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDU0NTg0OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@zulus, I'll also try to grab some time the second semester, we could start by adding support for PHP 8.0 in our parsers&lexers ;)
Since I'm not using PHP 8.0 (yet), it would be nice to list all new language features that should go in our parsers&lexers (and code formater), so at least users could use PHP 8.0 syntax. 
What do you think?

On my side, I can have a deeper look only end of June. But without any answer of @zulus I won't be able to be a big help ;)
Anyway we're only 2 developers left on PDT for now, so we wll sadly be less responsive than one or two years ago.

Not yet for PHP 8.0, we already have done feature roadmaps for previous versions of PHP, so it should not be a big deal. Our ""time deadline"" was (until recently) based on Eclipse's release cycles (every 3 months at best or 6 months at worst). 
Maybe full support for PHP 8.0 will be made accross multiple versions of eclipse.
Again, it's only a supposition, I really don't know what Dawid is planning (or has already done) ;)

Thank you, that's great to know! :) Personaly I never worked on open source projects using helping funds, so I'm pretty new in this area. I know it can be done through github sponsoring. For sure we should do that for PDT, it would maybe attract new developers, or maybe help Dawid on its PDT work.

I understand completely that development when no being paid is not a cake walk and I certainly give thanks for the effort so far, however the reality is this:

1. It would be simple to keep end-users realistically updated as to intention: Your communication completely sucks.
2. Point 1 has a very real cost to businesses depending on the IDE: it removes the ability to determine a strategy and reduces the ability to take advantage of new language features, resulting in longer times to create suboptimal code.

So, please do the right thing and make a clear statement regarding what the intention is to support PHP 8, and in what timeframe.

@zulus - can we not help fund in some way? I would need to confirm this internally but we have 5 developers currently using the project, and I'm fine to pay an annual amount for each developer that would roughly equate with what paid tools such as say PHPstorm charges (I would like 50% of our funding to go directly to this project) - this could be win:win as the problem for us with the free model is that the project is always ""second"" as long as developers are unpaid","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAFsa6c427qC5/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I've got 8.0 installed thanks and likewise see nothing

It does rather look like this project is dead and if so - while I have no issue with @zulus  stopping development due to lack of funding or time - I am VERY unimpressed with him for stringing businesses along for so long. As I have explained in the past to him, there are very real financial implications associated with this. We have held off on migrating and upgrading to PHP 8 based solely on his commitments. 

@zulus  - very very poor.

I can tell you an alternative is Visual Studio Code which has supported PHP 8 for some time now.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAFsa6c4_ul5x/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

There are many ways to show respect ...one very important one is to have respect for the people you make commitments to. He has not and I have expressed my dissatisfaction. There is only one reason I could accept his lack of follow through and communication and that is if he has been unable to access his computer since his last commit.

I have been looking into adding this support myself, which would be considerably easier if Dawid would work with me to help point me in the right direction.

Yes I agree. From what I understood, he was planning a refactor before, I'd very much indeed to see PDT code more simple so I could step up and do occasional PR sometime. But right now, I guess we have to wait for him to put things in order.

I'd love to help, but we simply can't, at least until he resurface. That's sad but sometime, that's what happens with free software.

Let's see.

Hi,

There are a ton of developers who have been waiting probably over a year now for the lead developer of the PDT (PHP) project to provide any sort of update and people are becoming desperate. See https://github.com/eclipse/pdt/issues/95 

The problem is less about whether PDT is going to continue, and more about the lack of any form of formal communication to the user base as to what is going on.

I am one of these people ‚Äì I love Eclipse and PDT but this not knowing is killing our business as we are unable to take advantage of any of the new features of PHP because Eclipse doesn‚Äôt support them.

I am therefore writing to you in the hope that you will engage the project leads, get an answer, and make a formal statement to the ever more desperate user base.

Thank you in advance.

To manage expectations, the EMO has no special powers to force committers to make specific commitments regarding the allocation of resources. Ultimately, Eclipse PDT is a community project and relies on contributions from the community to survive and thrive. 

The core problem here, AFAICT, is that the project is chronically under resourced.

We have a couple of people in our community who are good at organising willing communities and revitalising open source projects. I'll reach out to my contacts to see if I can get one of them interested in helping with the community development and planning aspects of Eclipse PDT, which would allow @zulus more space to focus on the core implementation. For this to work, we're going to need at least a few folks to contribute some development resources to the effort.

Do you want to split the project so that others can take over and develop certain parts, or do you mean that you will develop and publish parts?

It's solution to drop PHP <5.x support and focus on PHP 7>= or that
PHP 7.4 is no longer supported to only support PHP 8 >= and keep current
PDT as is.
If someone will need lower PHP support, he can create a separate workspace
with an older version of PDT.

For now we have 3 parsers for each PHP versions:

1. Document structure (WTP integration)
1. DOM AST (editor colors, quick fix etc..)
1. DLTK AST (validation, indexing, type inference ...)

On next version I originally planned one parser for all PHP versions (latest) + extra validation directly on AST (similar to how PHP validate static expressions on constants), this will greatly reduce further maintenance, but for now wasn't finished.

Because at least DLTK AST have to be re-implemented, less versions === less work","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAFsa6c5QqD3Y/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I was attempting to setup Eclipse for contributing to PDT (long time I wrote Java, but hey, never too late to get back at it).

I followed the guide there: https://wiki.eclipse.org/PDT/Contributing#Quick_guide

It seems rather outdated, for starters:

 - http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads is not a valid update site anymore, at least my Eclipse tells me that it's not a valid repository,
 - https://git.eclipse.org/c/pdt/org.eclipse.pdt.git/plain/dev/psf/pdt-dev.psf is not a valid URL, it gives a 404 error.

Actually I'm stuck there, even though, a long time ago, I did wrote a few Eclipse plugins, things have changed drastically in 13 years.

Is there any up to date documentation ? Or did I misdone something ?

I was instructed on the Eclipse Platform bug tracker to open an issue here.

Sometimes when using the undo and redo functions, a portion of code goes missing, and I can't get it back. The data loss happens when doing a ""redo"" after having used the ""undo"" function. I expect the ""redo"" to revert the change that was undone, but instead I get either an incomplete piece of it or nothing at all.

I use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Z (undo) and Ctrl+Shift+Z (redo).

I can't reproduce this intentionally. I really don't know how. It happens at least once a week while I'm working.

Running tests marked @depends <passed test>, these passed tests are not re-run. Passing them is a precondition for failed dependent tests (the ones with the @depends ... tag). So, phpunit does not respect the @depends tag.

 - Debian Linux 
 - Version Bullseye (Testing)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Make sure the test AND its dependent test (mentioned in @depends) both pass
2. Make the test fail, the dependent test should still pass
3. Correct the test (undo the steps to make it fail) and click on ""Run failed tests""

Please describe.**
Without the console output there is no indication at all that tests returned warnings, skipped or incomplete. These might make a big difference, because they also give indications about coverage. 
Skipped and incomplete are easier to search for, but before they have to be made aware of.
Browsing through all the tests is time-consuming.

**Is this feature require new UI elements or modify existing?**
**Describe the solution you'd like**
Additional button and counter each to filter for warnings, skipped and incomplete, similar to ""Show the failures only"".

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Activate PHPUnit's summary (see next section) to get required details at least on the console. But that's only half way and not even an MVP, because it requires to review the results of two views instead of the one it belongs into.

**Additional context**
This is loosely related to and amplified by the loss of a summary on recent PHPUnit versions, where the above information could at least be retrieved from the console.

The composer.json file editor is unexpectedly reformatting its source code every time you open it. The first thing you notice is the asterisk `*` indicating that the file has unsaved changes. You cannot undo these changes.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
Eclipse IDE for PHP Developers (includes Incubating components)
Version: 2021-03 (4.19.0)
Build id: 20210312-0638

Installed with the Eclipse installer downloaded from eclipse.org.

**Describe your system**
 - OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Fedora Workstation 34 (my desktop and my laptop)
 - PHP Version: 7.4 (Ubuntu) and 8.0 (Fedora)
 - Webserver Version: httpd 2.4
 - Composer: 2.0.13

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a composer.json file and switch from the ""Overview"" to the ""composer.json"" tab
2. Now that the file has unsaved changes (indicated by the asterisk `*`), you can see that spaces have been replaced with tabs, and there's a space character preceding every colon `:`. You cannot undo these with `Ctrl + Z`.
3. Without making any changes to the file, switch in and out of the ""composer.json"" tab, and you'll see that the asterisk `*` is gone. However, the file is not the same any more, as if the previously unsaved changes were automatically saved and committed.
4. But Eclipse is wrong! The actual file on disk is not even touched. You can confirm that by opening composer.json with another editor or checking with Git tools. Phew!

**Expected behavior**
The file should never be changed just by opening it.

And when we trigger it, the operation is blocking and prevent using the IDE until it finishes.

Problem is that, on large projects, even with a more than decent and more than recent machine (i.e. a nice core i7 with 16 go of RAM, and a beefed-up Eclipse configuration for using much RAM) this operation can take up to 20~30 minutes, using all CPU cores and making the machine lag (it happened to me right now).

Aside the fact that it forces me to do an intellectual break from my code (which is not a bad thing) and the fact that it's so long I decided to take some time to write this issue, it's quite annoying mostly.

I have no idea why it's so slow, but in the many tasks it does, between a full PHP code re-indexing (it seems at least) and validating all HTML files it finds (and sadly, last time I accidentally triggered it, I had some coverage HTML report files, a huge HTML report).

Fact is, it actually happens a lot, accidentally triggering this feature, either by misclicking it in the contextual menu, or by accidentally typing the keyboard shortcut for it (yes, it happens to me a lot).

When Eclipse doesn't crash on the most extreme projects I work with, I have to wait for 20~30 minutes before being able reusing my IDE.

Is there a way to either:

 - completely disable this feature for PHP projects ?
 - or fine tune it to make it much faster and less resources consuming ?

No, clean is additional step.

Normally this button provoke ""incremental build"" (file changes since last build only), but when you disable auto-build it's mostly ""full build"" (all files).

The vertical line number region sporadically exhibits garbled or duplicated text.
It is reproducible with both PHP and JavaScript files.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
This is only reproducible on Wayland sessions. I have tested it on Ubuntu 21.04 and Fedora Workstation 34 using the GNOME desktop.

Eclipse 2021-06
PDT 7.2.0

**Describe your system**
 - PHP Version: 7.4

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a file that is long enough to scroll through it
2. Keep scrolling up and down (with the mouse wheel or touchpad) until the line numbers become garbled. Scrolling any further from that point might trigger a new render that eliminates the glitch.

in both the php internals mailing list and in RFC's, $_ is the variable name used when a variable have to exist for some reason, but isn't being used. a common example is iterating keys with foreach, 
```php
foreach(returns_array() as $key => $_){
    (...)

here $_ have to exist as demanded by the foreach api, but it's not being used. pdt linter will complain that $_ isn't being used here...

Let's assume we have two PHP files, `a.php` and `b.php`.
`a.php` defined a variable, then it includes `b.php`, which uses that variable.
In `b.php` we can tell the linter that the variable is defined with the `@var` php doc, but there's no way (and no official phpdoc API afaik) to tell the linter that the variable will be actually used.

Example:

- `a.php`
   ```php
   <?php
   $foo = 'bar';
   // Here we'd need a phpdoc to tell the linter that $foo is actually used
   
   include 'b.php';

- `b.php`
   ```php
   <?php
   /** @var string $foo */
   echo $foo;

hmm, turns out that if you declare the variable with phpdoc before using it, then it seems the linter won't complain, eg
```
<?php
/** @var string $foo */
$foo = 'bar';
// Here we'd need a phpdoc to tell the linter that $foo is actually used

include 'b.php';
```
is ok (the linter does not complain about it not being used..), but
```
<?php
$foo = 'bar';
/** @var string $foo */
// Here we'd need a phpdoc to tell the linter that $foo is actually used

include 'b.php';
```
is not ok and makes the linter complain  that $foo isn't being used
 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø

>$_ is just the name of the variable in your specific use case

well it's slightly more than that, it's \*the\* variable name used for ""unused variables that have to exist"" in PHP RFC's and mailing lists, see for example
- (foreach) https://wiki.php.net/rfc/is_list
- (foreach) https://wiki.php.net/rfc/restrict_globals_usage 
- (unused argument) https://wiki.php.net/rfc/uuid

You could use a different language structure or native function to process the array in a different way when you need the key but not the data. Where this isn't possible, a comment in the code would show why the unused variable exists and could document the rationale behind using the foreach at the same time (as in the `array_is_list` example).

As far as I am aware `$_` doesn't have a formal language level meaning in PHP, it's just a convention for unused variables that have to exist. If PDT introduces a linter special case for a variable named `$_` what about instances where people have used a variable named this way in their projects? Should your proposed enhancement only apply in foreach statements or other control structures?

Variables named like this are conventionally used in various languages for intentionally unused variables, so I can certainly see where you are coming from. Perhaps adding a configurable list of variable names that the linter would ignore would be an option that would allow for this.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAFsa6c439eLE/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the code-assist thing should turn the code into
```php
<?php
/**
 * 
 * @return number
 */
function f(){
    // */
    return 5;
}
```
but it doesn't. instead you'll just end up with the code
```php
<?php
/**
 * 
function f(){
    // */
    return 5;
}
```

```

This bit of code references the internal class for AdapterManager, but the signature changed of the method (getFactories). It now returns a Map instead of HashMap.

https://github.com/eclipse/pdt/blob/cbff9260efedf8063029339ae1ffc800f9f4ba65/plugins/org.eclipse.php.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/php/internal/debug/ui/PHPDebugUIPlugin.java#L110

This results in an exception like this in 2021-12 M2:

```
Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'java.util.HashMap org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.AdapterManager.getFactories()'
    at org.eclipse.php.internal.debug.ui.PHPDebugUIPlugin.start(PHPDebugUIPlugin.java:110)
```

Note that AFAIU you won't be able to run the same version of PDT against 4.21 and 4.22 (unless you removed the access to internals or jump through hoops and use reflection). Also note that the reason the API changed is a side effect of behaviour changes of the Adapater Manager (See [Bug 576024](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=576024) - I don't think there is a N&N entry about this yet.

PS I would guess `manager.registerAdapters(propertiesFactory, IVariable.class);` can be replaced with `manager.registerAdapters(propertiesFactory, PHPVariable.class);` and then you can delete all the internals access. That would make `PHPDebugElementAdapterFactory` preferred for `PHPVariable`. (I haven't tested it, and you may need to also register `DBGpVariable` but I wasn't sure what that was for.)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/122/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

**Describe the eclipse environment**

**To Reproduce**
final public static function collectionToArray(OCICollection $OCIcollection) : array {

Eclipse will ""zigzag"" OCICollection and fail to resolve it to a type. This is incorrect as the script executes perfectly.

On the other hand, Eclipse will recognise OCI_Collection as a valid type. But execution of the script will fail as the type is invalid


**Expected behavior**
Eclipse PDT should recognise the OCICollection type as a valid type.

This is a heads up because the Orbit project is no longer maintaining that bundle as it is was last updated only in the CVS repo. When you next update to a newer version of Orbit it won't be found anymore. See https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg18987.html Please feel free to reach out to me for advice if/when you update your Orbit repo. In the meantime everything will keep working as I am providing a patch to Orbit/SimRel to contribute that bundle manually.

I wonder if this project is dead because PHP 8 is still not supported (and #95 is not really answered) after so long and in general there were no commits for a long time.

I assume, that the validation error `Constant expression contains invalid operations` in the following line appears because of missing PHP 8 support:

    function formatDate($IntlDateFormatter=new IntlDateFormatter('de_DE',IntlDateFormatter::FULL,IntlDateFormatter::FULL,'Europe/Berlin',IntlDateFormatter::GREGORIAN)) {

This code works on my server with PHP 8.1 without problems, so the syntax is correct and I expect my IDE not to display errors that are not errors.

Therefore, I am now looking for another IDE for PHP development under Linux (preferably with few dependencies and available as a .deb package, Linux binary or Java-based).
Can anyone recommend an alternative for Eclipse PDT (which supports the latest PHP version and is actively developed further)?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/141/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@troizet Thanks for the tip with Netbeans. It actually makes a good impression, but what I don't like is that it takes about 830 MB of disk space. I already found the 580 MB of Eclipse with PDT quite large.

@ibakirov From your list, Komodo IDE looks like the best alternative. With about 254 MB it is even relatively small and the functions are actually sufficient for my purpose. What I don't like is that you have to register (even though it's free).

Before I move on to Netbeans or Komodo IDE, I think I'll wait for a new version of Eclipse PDT after all.

I have followed this interesting thread for over a month now. 
For me, I feel the time is now -  approximately one month until support of PHP7.4 ends. I have used Eclipse PDT since 2014, and I am super happy about the program! But‚Ä¶ Now I am getting really worried about my PHP7.4 web application. The application is crucial for the International Medical Device business. (I perhaps can explain later...)
Please, give me an advice. Is it urgent for me to abandon Eclipse PDT. Will there be a solution ready, and have a chance to adapt tested code to PHP8, within this timeframe?

There is some bug in Eclipse IDE PDT and remote XDEBUG. No path mapping if server path is '/var/www/html', any breakpoints doesn't work.

In the **xdebug.log** Eclipse setting wrong path, still getting my local path of project **_breakpoint_set -i 10 -t line -f file:///home/art/eclipse-workspace/mini-local/info.php -n 4_** (please look at pics)

Remote debugging works fine when remote path on the server changed to other something like '/var/www/html2' and then breakpoints and path mapping works properly. 

Is here some magics with a '/var/www/html' path?

They should be styled as classes right now, hmm

this one should be available in recent build. there are formatter setttings for:
1. Attribute group (attributes are styled as constructro calls)
2. Match expression
3. Named expresion
4. Enum declaration / enum case

Argument `$x` and use of `$x` within `$x * $y` yield undefined variable `$x` problems. However auto-complete does work. Adding a type-hint to argument `$x` will suggest completions when I type `$x->` within the arrow function expression. No problems are being generated for variable `$y` and it will be suggested by auto-complete if I write `$` and hit `CTRL+Space` within the arrow function expression (variable `$x` is absent from the list of suggested variables).

Yes, I used to use Zend Framework myself and ran into this. As @mlocati says, Eclipse cannot know if a plain PHP file is included into the context of a class and thus it is expected and correct behaviour for `$this` to be detected as undefined. Using a docblock is the normal process.

For ZF1:

```
<?php
/**
 * @var Zend_View $this
 */
```

For ZF3, Expressive, Mezzio or Laminas:

```
<?php
/**
 * @var Zend\View\Model\ViewModel|Laminas\View\Model\ViewModel $this
 */

If you have a function like `array_key_exists`, where the `$key` parameter can be `int|string`, then this is not correctly shown in the tooltips, and autocompletion ignores the union type parameter. 

**Describe the eclipse environment**
Eclipse 23.03
Eclipse PDT 8.0.0.202305212131

**Describe your system**
 - OS: Ubuntu
 - Version 23.04

**To Reproduce**
For example, if you type

```
array_k
```

then wait for the list of suggestions to come up, hit Enter to select `array_key_exists`, it will produce this:

```
array_key_exists($array)
```

instead of the expected

```
array_key_exists($key, $array)
```


**Expected behavior**
Union type parameters should work like the others

Shouldn't PDT list only `MyLocallyRenamedException` as defined in the same file? It instead shows all the `RuntimeException` classes in the project.

Furthermore, if you hit `Enter` to accept the first proposal, PDT completes the line like this:

Please describe.**

At the moment, PDT complains about the `scalar` type in docblocks like `@param`/`@return`/`@var` complaining about ""scalar cannot be resolved to a type"". Other types work fine with no problem. The `scalar` type is widely supported by other tools such as phpDocumentor and PHPStan.

![Untitled3](https://github.com/eclipse-pdt/pdt/assets/776829/11787bcc-1b10-4760-bf60-3a1cd03a0b17)
See PHPStan playground as source: https://phpstan.org/r/a61337af-e21d-440f-9da0-17c8b50d3cc3

The `scalar` type isn't used often in practice afaict, in particular because PHP as a whole is transitioning to use more strict types. As of PHP 8+, it can be replaced with a union type of `string|int|float|bool`. Note that `scalar` is not a ""real"" type in the sense that it can not be used as a native type declaration in PHP.

**Is this feature require new UI elements or modify existing?**

No new UI elements required as far as I can tell.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

The `scalar` type should be supported in docblocks but not as a native PHP type.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

The `scalar` type can be replaced with a union type of `string|int|float|bool`. This is easy enough to probably not affect most PDT users. That said, I wonder if it makes sense to adjust the code base to work around minor quirks in IDEs.

**Additional context**

Glad to see PDT is picking up some speed again lately, so I'm happy to support this development by sponsoring the excellent work done by @zulus ‚ù§Ô∏è Most PDT quirks regarding latest PHP changes have been resolved for me recently, so while I realize this is probably not the most pressing feature, it's also one of the last occurrences that mark my code as red. Keep up the good work!

Nice edge cause ‚Äì though not specific to the `scalar` type.

It looks like the `@param integer` referencing the `int` type has preference over any `integer` class: https://3v4l.org/6C7Nl + https://phpstan.org/r/9afb97cc-81c8-4ad7-ab4b-f014e21a3171

Personally, I don't have a strong preference for either case, but other tools seem to ignore the class with the same name in this case.

The whole namespace name is expected to be displayed in black standard font, since ""enum"" is not a [reserved keyword](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.keywords.php) (yet?) and `Enum` is a valid word in a namespace.
Instead, it's displayed in bold purple font, just as reserved keywords are. It happens both in `namespace` and `use` statements.

When the cursor is on the name of a class static function, the occurrences where this function is called in the same file are not highlighted whereas they should be.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
- Eclipse version: 2023-06
- PDT version: 8.0.0.202306050832

**Describe your system**
 - OS: Ubuntu
 - Version: 18.04

**To Reproduce**
1. Import and open this example class:
```php
class Test {
    public static function staticFunction() {}
    public function instanceFunction() {}

    public function test() {
        self::staticFunction();
        Test::staticFunction();
        $this->staticFunction();

        $this->instanceFunction();
    }
}
```
2. Click on the `staticFunction` function name in its declaration (second line)

**Expected behavior**
The word `staticFunction` where the user clicked (in declaration) is highlighted (as expected).
It's also expected that the three places where this function is called in the `test()` function are highlighted, but only the occurrence using `$this` keyword is highlighted (see first screenshot).

Same happens if the cursor is on `staticFunction` after `$this` keyword.

Note that on the other hand, when the cursor is on a `staticFunction` call using `self::` or `Test::`, the 4 occurrences (1 declaration + 3 calls) are correctly highlighted.

I tried with instance functions but they seem to be highlighted properly, I think this affects only static functions.

**Screenshots**

The real bug is inside occurence finder. For both case you should see same selection (occurence finder is a mix of AST analyze + TYPE inference).

If you want to refer to the `SensitiveParameter` defined in the root namespace (that is, the one that comes with PHP 8.2), you have to use `#[\SensitiveParameter]` instead of `#[SensitiveParameter]`.

Relying on excessive arguments on function call is considered obsolete design for modern php. Excessive arguments can be represented with variadic parameter. If a warning/info is shown, it is expected that the user changes the function signature.

Currently, PHP type system covers most of the cases. With ```mixed```, other unrepresented types can be represented by it. Another purpose of ```mixed``` is to discern whether people forgot to give a type or not. Adding types to all possible places is a good discipline. PDT need to provide additional validation to switch on and off to adjust this rule to the project policy.

I do not mean it like that. On the contrary, I wrote it because I appreciate the work done by the maintainer. The PDT is a good quality tool, and deserves further improvement. At this time I have not been able to contribute a patch that fixes those errors. The only way is to report all the errors I find. If the maintainer uses his free time, then my form of appreciation is to use the free time this weekend.

I found all these errors all day long. This is better for me because I can focus, instead of putting a little time in each week. And the result is a fairly comprehensive list of issues, which I probably wouldn't have gotten around to if time had been fragmented. By just reading the title, you can predict the content. If you read the contents, you will find case examples that are also comprehensive. Luckily, all the issues I wrote about were not interrupted by other people's issues, so that a kind of solid narrative was formed.

I'm aware that my findings are flooding this repo. I report only the most basic issues. The more errors I find now, the harder it will be for me to get them again later. That's why I do something like this only once (or maybe twice) in my lifetime. We all know that this fix takes a long time, and I absolutely did not expect it to be finished in two or three releases. The maintainer can choose the issues he thinks are worth working on now, and postpone the others at a later time. Please don't feel burdened.

For case problems on keywords (and several other things that haven't been made an issue of yet), my goal in proposing a new validation is to train habits/form the user's mentality to adhere to consensus, and not just rely on other tools. Some people trivialize the issue of consensus and leave the repair work to colleagues. Even though the use of other tools is easy enough, this sort of thing sometimes still creates friction. If an error is raised, at least there's less reason to be evasive for people who don't comply. So, this kind of issue is not merely a personal choice. But this is all left up to the maintainer, whether this proposal will be accepted or not.

Once again I apologize if what I did gave a negative impression :pray:.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAFsa6c5fJOSp/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Regular .php files open in PHP Editor as expected. I also have some .module files that are PHP files, for which I've selected ""Use it for all .module files"" in the ""Open With"" => PHP Editor dialog. They open in PHP Editor as expected, syntax highlighting working as expected.

`Symfony\Component\Console\Application` in version 6.3 has 49 methods:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/v6.3.0/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Application.php

However, in the PDT outline, only 7 methods are shown:

That also has the effect that when you extend this `Application` likes this:

```php
class testapp extends Symfony\Component\Console\Application
{
}
```

PDT displays the following error:
`The type testapp must implement the inherited abstract method ResetInterface::reset()` 
(because `reset` is one of the methods in the baseclass it doesn't see)

**Describe the eclipse environment**
- Eclipse 2023-06 
- PDT 8.1.0.202306111945

**Describe your system**
 -  macOS 12.6

**To Reproduce**
see above

**Expected behavior**
PDT should be able to parse all valid PHP files

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Foo\Domain\ClientSecurity\Query;

use Foo\Domain\Client\Model\SalarieId;
use Foo\Shared\Attr\Repository;
use Foo\Shared\Query\ListQuery

#[Repository(Profil::class)] // HERE IS LACKING THE USE STATEMENT
class ProfilQuery extends ListQuery
{
}
```

When I hit CTRL+SHIFT+o (re-organise imports), it converts it to:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Foo\Domain\ClientSecurity\Query;

use Foo\Domain\Client\Model\SalarieId;
use Foo\Shared\Attr\Repository;
use Foo\Shared\Attr\Repository as Profil; // PLEASE NOTE HERE THE ""as Profil""
use Foo\Shared\Query\ListQuery

#[Repository(Profil::class)]
class ProfilQuery extends ListQuery
{
}
```

The `Foo\Shared\Attr\Repository as Profil` `use` statement is wrong and should be, in my case, `Foo\Domain\ClientSecurity\Model\Profil` instead.

I should get:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Foo\Domain\ClientSecurity\Query;

use Foo\Domain\Client\Model\SalarieId;
use Foo\Domain\ClientSecurity\Model\Profil;
use Foo\Shared\Attr\Repository;
use Foo\Shared\Query\ListQuery

#[Repository(Profil::class)]
class ProfilQuery extends ListQuery

Worst part is that once I fixed it manually, if I hit CTRL+SHIFT+o again, it will revert back my fix to the broken one.

When the setting PHP > Editor > Save Actions > Organize use statements is on and you use `true` in a namespaced class, eclipse/PDT will add a use statement `use const False\MyClass\true;` on save. This use statement can not be resolved and thereby effectivly kills the class.

**Describe the eclipse environment**

Tested in eclipse 2023-06 and 2023-09. PDT 8.0 and 8.1. My project uses [squizlabs/php_codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) as a composer dependency. If I uninstall it, the falsy use statements are gone!

**Describe your system**
 - OS Windows
 - Version 10
 - PHP Version 8.2

**To Reproduce**
1. Use PHP_CodeSniffer as a composer dependency in your project
2. Switch the setting ""PHP > Editor > Save Actions > Organize use statements"" on
3. Create a namespaced class and use the constant `true` in it
4. Hit save and observe the (namespace) use statements

**Expected behavior**

use statements should generally be added, but not if they are not needed and can not be resolved. 

**Workaround**

1. Disable this setting (I do not want to, I like it)
2. Use the global search (magnifier icon) to replace those statements (using regex) `use const False\\MyClass\\true;\n` with empty string - everytime you change a file.

### Details:

1.  Checkbox Addition:
Introduce a new checkbox in the NewPHPClassWizard and NewPHPInterfaceWizard UIs, labeled ""Add Strict Types Declaration."" This checkbox will give developers the option to include the declare(strict_types = 1); statement in the generated PHP code.
2.  Code Generation Logic:
Modify the code generation logic in the wizards to include the declare(strict_types = 1); statement when the ""Add Strict Types Declaration"" checkbox is selected.
3. User Interface Integration
Ensure that the checkbox is appropriately integrated into the UI, allowing users to easily toggle the ""Add Strict Types Declaration"" option during the class/interface creation process.
 
### Benefits:

Enhanced control over the generated PHP code's strict types declaration, aligning with modern PHP development practices.
Provides developers with an easy way to adopt strict typing in their classes, interfaces, and traits from the point of creation.. .","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/263/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Since a couple of weeks or so, PDT gives the wrong signature for `array_key _exists` (haven't checked other functions, just noticed it on this one). For some reason it thinks that the first parameter is optional (which is invalid even in recent PHP versions)

**Describe the eclipse environment**

```php

<?php
function get_contents() {
  file_get_contents(""http://example.com"");
  var_dump($http_response_header); // variable is populated in the local scope

get_contents();
var_dump($http_response_header); // a call to get_contents() does not populate the variable outside the function scope

In recent versions of PDT, a project workspace directory is naively used as the document root for the PHP Built-in Server.
I.e. the server starts a process like:
/usr/bin/php -S 127.0.0.1:8180 -t **/home/joe/myworkspace/myphpproject**

This breaks a lot of the WST Server functionality:
1. When the project Location differs from its Path (for example when you create the project using the option ""Create project at existing location""), the project workspace directory doesn't actually contain the project files (just the metadata). Hence nothing is served.
2. If you add multiple php projects to a server, only one of them is actually served.
3. Run As->Run on Server on an object doesn't work even in the naive case as WST assumes a context root of localhost:port/project_name/ rather than localhost:port/.
4. PDT assumes that the project file structure exactly corresponds to the structure of the served documents. This is supposed to be defined by the Deployment Assembly (in WST terminology). Admittedly, there is no such thing in a PDT project, but in older versions of PDT it seems to be implicitly defined as the aggregate of the projects source folders.
I.e. if you had the files /src/a.php and /htdocs/b.html and both /src and /htdocs are defined as source folders, the files used to be served as /a.php and /b.html, but are now served as /src/a.php and /htdocs/b.html.

It appears that this works (more or less) fine in PDT 7 and is broken in PDT 8. More specifically:
Works:
  PHP Development Tools (PDT)	7.2.1.202112011741	org.eclipse.php.feature.group	Eclipse PDT
Broken:
  PHP Development Tools (PDT)	8.1.0.202307170929	org.eclipse.php.feature.group	Eclipse PDT

I'm pretty sure that issue #68 is at least partly to blame.

I've had **Eclipse PDT 2023** version which was working fine. I decided to take a look at the newer version of the eclipse PDT. This time it was not just to extract and use. This time it asked to be installed. That I did with the installer. I've had an application which was on PHP 7.4 version. After the installation got finished and ran the Eclipse PDT. It keeps crashing after that. Now I can't even use the older version of Eclipse PDT. Even the older version of Eclipse PDT 2022 crashes after giving suggestions or an autocomplete feature.

Please describe.**
PHP 8.4 it's schedule to be release at november 2024. But your alpha's will be release in July. It's any planning to support property hooks at Eclipse 2024-09 release or to build nights to current version? 

**Is this feature require new UI elements or modify existing?**
No.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
One of the most anticipated features of PHP 8.4 is property hooks. This feature allows developers to define custom ""get"" and ""set"" behaviors of class properties. Inspired by languages like Kotlin and Swift, property hooks simplify the creation of accessors and mutators, reducing boilerplate code and making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

Example: 

```php
class Foo
{
    private int $runs = 0;
 
    public function getRuns(): int { return $this->runs; }
 
    public function setRuns(int $runs): void
    {
      if ($runs <= 0) throw new Exception();
      $this->runs = $runs;
    }
}
 
$f = new Foo();
 
$f->setRuns($f->getRuns() + 1);
``` 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Implement support this language feature, in next or actual Eclipse version. If need help to test or something @zulus please let me know.

I tried to use it in Eclipse PDT 2024-06, but when you go to the Eclipse IDE menu: Window -> Preferences -> Installed PHPs and try to point to the new PHP 8.4, the IDE throws an exception (Selected location doesn't refer to a valid PHP executable). The problem is not the location of the file, but the new version of PHP. I test on Windows 11. PHP 8.3.9 works fine when using the same directory name; in my case, c:\php. In both cases, the PHP executable stays in the same directory, but 8.4 doesn't work at the IDE, the IDE does not recognize the new version of the PHP executable.

If not difficult, I suggest a new IDE UI option to generate property hooks, like get and set. When you click on the source code and a sub-menu appears, go to the source option and put the new option: **""Property Hooks Get and Set""**, for example.¬†

Create a Twig File Template with Eclipse Twig Plug-in throws an error if you try to create the file out of the **src** root folder in an Empty Composer Project.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
Eclipse Version: 2024-06;
PDT Version: PDT Profiler UI Plug-in 8.2.0.202311292129 org.eclipse.php.profiler;

 - Version: 11;
 - PHP Version: 8.3.9;
 - Webserver Version: Apache 2.4;
 - Utilis: Composer 2.7.6 and Twig 3.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to Eclipse Menu File -> New -> Empty Composer Project;
2. Fill the Basic Composer Configuration, for example: **Project Name**: test; **Vendor Name**: Test; **Type**: **project**; Click on the Finish Button;
3. Now that the project has been created, select it and go to Eclipse Menu File -> New -> Other -> Search for Wizard Twig template; Click on Next Button;
4. Fill in the information about the new Twig template, for example: **Source folder**: test/src; **File name**: template.twig (or other name); Click the Finish Button. The Twig Template File was created with no problem;
5. Now create a new folder in **test project**, select the project name, and then go to Eclipse Menu File -> New -> Folder;
6. Fill the **Folder name**: views (for example);
7. Repeat these steps:
- Go to, Eclipse Menu File -> New -> Other -> Search for Wizard Twig template; Click on Next Button;
- Fill the informations about New Twig Template, for example: **Source folder**: test/views; **File name**: template2.twig (or other name); Click on Finish Button. The Twig Template File is not created, and IDE throws a exception: Creation of element failed - Cannot invoke ""org.eclipse.dltk.core.IScriptFolder.getSourceModule(string)"" because the return value of ""org.eclipse.dltk.ui.wizards.NewSourceModulePage.getScriptFolder()"" is null.

**Additional context**
Now if you create a simple PHP Project, in Eclipse Menu File -> New -> PHP Project. Create any folder inside this project and then create a Twig Template File in this folders, this problem will not occur.¬†The **scr** root folder, a principle, is the origin of the problem. The Twig Wizard only works if you create the files and folders inside this root folder when the project is the kind of Empty Composer Project.

Please describe.**

My issue is related to the configuration of the Installed PHPs interpreters.

In 'Windows | Preferences | PHP | Installed PHPs' you can configure the available
PHP interpreters by pressing the Add button. The window that appears allows you to set
the interpreter and the configuration files read by it.

- Issue 1
  The label of the checkbox ""Use system default php.ini configuration"" should
  be changed to something more suggestive. The actual label makes explicit
  reference to the name php.ini. Nothing in this label sugggests that this
  checkbox is related to the ""Additional .ini files parsed"" by the
  interpreter. The php interpreter itself prints ""Additional .ini files
  parsed:"" when run with the --ini option and this checkbox controls exactly this
  set of files.

- Issue 2
  The options in this window allow us to configure the execution environment of the PHP
  interpreter by specifying the php.ini file and providing some degree (but not complete) of
  control over the ""Additional .ini file parsed"".

  These execution environments will be referenced when creating Run Configurations.

  Let's assume the following:

  - I have configured a PHP interpreter that loads only the file php.ini.
  - I have a script main.php that I want to debug.

  Because the debugger is not loaded, I have to create a new Run Configuration and specify
  through PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR to scan a directory that contains the file xdebug.ini that in turn
  loads xdebug.so.

  This is the only way of doing that. It is not possible to use the checkbox ""Use
  system default php.ini configuration"" because  the interpreter could load more
  files that I want.
    
  Now, if I create another file, let's call it webpage.php, and I want to debug it
  I have to create a run configuration for it and specify again to load xdebug.ini.

  It would be more convenient if we could add a PHP interpreter and specify all
  additional ini files that must be loaded.

  In this way I could create two configurations:

  - **PHP - no debug** that loads only the file php.ini;
  - **PHP - with debug** that loads both php.ini and xdebug.ini;

  Then the Run Configurations of main.php and webpage.php would reference
  these configurations without the need of specifying PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR each time
  in the run configuration of a script that I want to to debug.



**Is this feature require new UI elements or modify existing?**

In 'Windows | Preferences | PHP | Installed PHPs / Add... ""

No to attain what I want, that is to launch a PHP interpeter that loads xdebug.ini I've created the following script:

PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR=/home/bob//php/tools/additional-ini-debug /usr/bin/php8.2 ""$@""
----  php8.2-dbg-only.sh ----

And I configure this script in Installed PHPs.

Variable is not marked as undefined in method if phpdoc describe the variable in other method.

**Describe the eclipse environment**
Version: 2024-12
PDT : 8.2

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
```
<?php

class Test
{
    public function test1()
    {
        /**
         * @var \DateTime $date
         */
        $date = new \DateTime();
    }

    public function test2()
    {
        $test = $date->test();

        echo $test;
    }
}

```

**Expected behavior**
$date in test2 should marked as undefined.
If I remove ""@var \DateTime $date"" comment, $date in test2 is correctly marked as undefined.

For compatibility reasons with development servers in my office i redirect my document root directory from drive C:\inetpub to Drive D:\inetpub via directory junction and the whole installation uses the junction on drive C: without any problems. Only Eclipse seems to resolve the junction to it's original location on drive D:, although the project points to drive C: too, as all other resources do. PDT creates a path mapping from D: to the project location automatically, although it can use the project dir too (I can see the files in the project explorer). With a little help from chatgpt, i figured out, that xdebug and PDT doesn't see the same files now and therefore xdebug is starting, stops at the first line, if configured, but then it ignores all set breakpoints. I don't know, if this is an issue in PDT, but i guess it is. Another problem is, that pathmapping, like it is described so often to fix the issue with the breakpoints, doesn't help here. Is there something you can do here? Or have you any advice to get rid of it by myself without deleting the junction?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-pdt/pdt/issues/288/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
