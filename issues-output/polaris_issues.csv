I'm not sure it is as easy as it sounds. A proper OAuth2 implementation is not a small effort. On the other hand, a test impl. that has gaps wrt to the OAuth2 RFC can lead to bugs in production code because it would be tested against a non-compliant OAuth2 server.

So eclipse-link is not getting loaded into the final JAR (thus not enabled) as of now. A modification of gradle.build is needed to enable it (include it in the final JAR).

So with the eclipse link extension, the credentials will be stored in the backend metastore after bootstrap (in this case, it will be in h2 files on your local file system...the location will be /tmp/eclipse-link/). You will need h2 client to read the content. It is also possible to replace h2 with other backends (e.g. Postgres), but modifications of Gradle file (used by eclipse link) will be needed as well as the connection info within persistent.xml under resources directory under polaris-service.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6HHVCb/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. The catalog does not expose any long of mid-term credentials to the client (reduces risk of credential leaks and makes access revocation is immediate, if/when it happens).
2. Client session runtime is not limited by STS session restrictions (extremely long client sessions are possible at the expense of slightly slower storage I/O calls).

One question that I have regards the performance implications of remote signing. I feel like it could introduce quite a bit of latency to the queries, of course mich depend on the implementation of both the runtime and the catalog. 

Another thing to be noted is that not all the runtimes actually support such feature. As an example I think that currently trino lacks such support: https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/21189

In fact MinIO support STS assumeRole API out of the box. The documentation explain you can setup an external idp like keycloak, but it will work with MinIO alone.

I can try to contribute to this feature request.
I have coded a polaris core storage implementation, copy of the aws, without the required arnRole parameter, replaced by endpoint, path style, and credentials.
You can choose a strategy for the client calling catalog : 
- ""vending token"" with default STS assume role like aws. It is working with MinIO, and should works also with Dell ECS, NetApp StorageGRID, etc...
- ""vending keys"" : 
- if you do not care a lot about security the catalog can send his own keys to the client
- you can also store in catalog keys dedicated to clients. You can then revoke them externally without breaking the catalog.

You can also choose a strategy during the creation of the catalog (cli, curl api) by passing catalog & or client keys by direct value, or  environnement name variable.
In case of the variable name, you have to be sure that Polaris can find them inside is running environnement, of course. A kubernetes production deployment should be suited for this configuration (envFromSecrets deployed to Polaris pods)

Parameters are described here :
https://github.com/lefebsy/polaris/blob/refs/heads/s3compatible/spec/polaris-management-service.yml#L906

You can have a look to the non-regression tests script to find example to create catalog and how to configure spark-sql :
https://github.com/lefebsy/polaris/blob/refs/heads/s3compatible/regtests/run_spark_sql_s3compatible.sh

You tried to setup S3 in spark confs, but it's useless : S3 endpoint and S3 keys are defined in the catalog inside Polaris.
Spark will retrieve the endpoint from Polaris catalog response, alongside the STS, during vended-credential negotiation with the catalog.

TL;DR :


Create the catalog :
```
curl -s -i -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer ${POLARIS_BEARER_TOKEN}"" \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      http://${POLARIS_HOST:-localhost}:8181/api/management/v1/catalogs \
      -d ""{
            \""name\"": \""my-minio-wh\"",
            \""id\"": 100,
            \""type\"": \""INTERNAL\"",
            \""readOnly\"": false,
            \""properties\"": {
              \""default-base-location\"": \""${S3_LOCATION}\""
            },
            \""storageConfigInfo\"": {
              \""storageType\"": \""S3_COMPATIBLE\"",
              \""allowedLocations\"": [\""${S3_LOCATION}/\""],
              \""s3.endpoint\"": \""https://localhost:9000\""
              \""s3.path-style-access\"": true,
              \""s3.credentials.catalog.access-key-id\"": \""S3_ACCESS_KEY_VAR_NAME\"",
              \""s3.credentials.catalog.secret-access-key\"": \""S3_SECRET_KEY_VAR_NAME\""
            }
          }""
```
Use the catalog :
```
${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-sql \
  --conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions \
  --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog \
  --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.type=rest \
  --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.uri=http://${POLARIS_HOST:-localhost}:8181/api/catalog \
  --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.header.X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation=vended-credentials \
  --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.token=""${POLARIS_BEARER_TOKEN}"" \
  --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.warehouse=my-minio-wh \

Hello,
Thank you for this feedback.
Do you think that the problem about views could be related to some restriction in the RoleArn you are testing ?
Because this PR is focusing on storage implementation, it is far from Polaris or Iceberg code related to view support (and views are supported by Polaris)
#225 quote the same message but was related to missing iceberg spark extension..","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6X5hBX/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/37,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/37,polaris,2440344588,37,[BUG] Getting the client-id and client-secret from stdout,AlexMercedCoder,52634838,Alex Merced,alex@alexmerced.dev,CLOSED,2024-07-31T15:32:16Z,2024-08-08T18:55:29Z,"A couple issues I had running through the quickstart, which just may documentation issues.

1. I deployed using Docker Compose

Looking at the stdout output I did not find what the docs asked me to look for:

```
**Bootstrapped with credentials: {""client-id"": ""XXXX"", ""client-secret"": ""YYYY""}**
```

But I did find this which I assumed was what I was looking for:

```
  realm: default-realm root principal credentials: fa44645a04410a0e:f1b82a42de2295da466682d3cfdbb0f1
```

I assume the format in this case was `id:secret`

So then ran the CLI command

```
./polaris \
  --client-id fa44645a04410a0e \
  --client-secret f1b82a42de2295da466682d3cfdbb0f1 \
  catalogs \
  create \
  --storage-type s3 \
  --default-base-location s3://some-example-bucket/folder/ \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::###########:role/polaris-storage \
  first-polaris-catalog
```

I ran into a few issues:

1. The Polaris CLI startup script did still needed Pydantic and dateutil to be installed, so I had to install those manually, assuming probably poetry. I do see them in the pyproject.toml, so I'm assuming that's more a ""my system"" problem, so Installed them in the virtual environment that was created and all seems to work fine now.

2. I ran the command above and got a JSON parsing error

```

There are a lot of common Java bugs/mistakes that even experienced coders make and [ErrorProne](https://errorprone.info/) is a fun tool from Google which automatically detects some of these. Adding it to our build would help developers to clean up their code before merging.

Hello,

This I tried locally couple days back after got the EclipseLink to work but later on this will fail on following line (u can try the same, it will failed on bootstrap as well):
```
emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(persistenceUnitName, properties);
```
This will raise error regarding unable to find persistence-unit (with FileStream, it does allows us to load file from other location but the above code will abort about not able to find persistenceUnitName. I am assuming this is specific to Jakarta. I am not very familiar with Java framework. Let me know if help is needed to test it again if you think this will work?

Yes @aihuaxu, I took a look at that this morning. Seems to be a pretty odd limitation. However, it is usable for the time being. I can volume mount a config over then update the jar in pod to generate the new jar file with this external config. Thanks for the info.

When calling the catalog oauth API, it often freezes.
We are using eclipse-link JDBC connector.

Retrying the request after a minute or two usually helps.

**Is this a possible security vulnerability?** 
no

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Connect polaris to a JDBC based server (We are using RDS - Postgres).
2. Request a token via Oauth API - scope is PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL.
3. Observe that it sometimes freezes/struck (API call remains hanging).

**Expected behavior**
No freeze.

Please describe.**
Support for S3 compatible services like min.io, cloudflare r2 and etc. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Allow other services compatible with S3 instead of just AWS. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Only options are use one of the supported storage.

**Additional context**

You might want to try do add a generic implementation to handle all S3 compatibles generic services, but will not be possible to have specific credentials per principal. 

Or try to keep different implementations, per example use cloudflare R2 api token to generate new access_key and secrets for each principal with a limited scoped.   

I am using cloudflare, thus I have interest in implement this feature. Just wanna know if do you have plans to create a generic S3 support or I should focus on a specific implementation (R2) to allow principal credentials revocation.

My organization does not allow getting user delegation key in Azure and the only option for us to authenticate with Azure is to use service principal. When my spark job tries to write to Azure, I will get the following exception at Polaris server:

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Since `ADLSFileIO` fall back to use `DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder` when there are no `SAS token` or `Storage Shared Key credential`, we can have a default catalog option to use environment as authentication type e.g.:
```json
{
    ""name"": ""test"",
    ""type"": ""INTERNAL"",
    ""properties"": {
        ""default-base-location"": ""abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/test/""

        ],
        ""authType"": ""APPLICATION_DEFAULT""
    }
}
```
so that any query engine can abstract away the credential and the main credential still being govern by Polaris Catalog for Azure.

There are a few considerations worth discussing and soliciting some input from additional folks to identify the best way forward:

1. Would there ever be scenarios where we want a single deployment to use the credential-vending SAS_TOKEN pattern for some catalogs/storageConfigs, while short-circuiting it to use ""application defaults"" for other catalogs, or would the choice of whether to use credential-vending semantics typically be a server-wide setting?
2. Is it better to convey the concept of ""fallthrough to application defaults for credentials"" with a single common syntax across all cloud providers or explicitly have such an APPLICATION_DEFAULT type separately defined for each cloud provider's storage configuration?
3. How should the server-level configuration expose the controls for whether to allow setting certain AuthTypes at a per-catalog level at all? For example, if the Polaris server is running in a more sensitive/privileged context, it may need to be configured to block the ability for individual catalogs to choose APPLICATION_DEFAULT credentials
4. Should the ""fallthrough"" behavior go further to allow propagating static credential config settings in the catalog `properties` map directly into the initialization of a FileIO? Should the behavior just skip going through the whole StorageConfigurationInfo/StorageIntegration stack entirely, including skipping allowed-location validations?
5. What are the semantics for returned vended credentials to the processing engine making the call? Should APPLICATION_DEFAULT only mean the Polaris itself uses local application defaults for interacting with files while ignoring any `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` settings and letting the caller engine fend for itself, or should the server be able to translate something that comes from APPLICATION_DEFAULT credentials into returned `config` settings that the remote engine can then use to access files?

At a high level we at least need to have a strict separation of effective privileges between the personas who can configure and run the Polaris server itself and those who can call `createCatalog`. In a mutual-trust setting, it makes sense to have relaxed constraints on the server-level configuration, but it needs to be possible to run the server in a secure mode as well where catalog creators are in a different realm of trust than the admins of the server.

One possibility that may require fewer changes to the management API and persistence model itself would be to have some server-level configuration settings that basically just short-circuit the storage validation/subscoping logic in `BasePolarisCatalog::refreshCredentials` and allow the FileIO initialization to fallback to default behaviors in how it looks for credentials from the environment.

While Polaris build requires Java 21+, the polaris-core module is built with source and target level = 11. 

I suppose that this has been decided in order to make it possible to include polaris-core in applications running with Java 11.

However, the code in main sources makes frequent usage of JDK methods that were introduced after Java 11, such as:

* `Stream.toList()` (Java 16)
* `List.getFirst()` and `List.getLast()` (Java 21)

This makes the compiled artifact effectively unusable, if included in an application running with Java 11.

**Is this a possible security vulnerability?** 
- [ ] yes -- if yes, stop here and contact security@polaris.io instead
- [x] no 

**Expected behavior**

The polaris-core module should not make use of any JDK API that was introduced after Java 11. Ideally, there should be a build task verifying this.

Alternatively, we should consider lifting the restriction of level 11 in polaris-core.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/76/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

My guess here when Spark is able to `createTable` but not PyIceberg is that PyIceberg got configured to send the `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` header which is interpreted as requesting credential-vending, which requires `TABLE_WRITE_DATA`, while perhaps PySpark wasn't configured with `spark.sql.catalog.polaris.header.X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation=true`.

Some of the distinction between CONTENT and METADATA is called out here: https://polaris.io/#tag/Access-Control/Access-control-privileges

The initialization where the `catalog_admin` default role per-catalog is assigned privileges is here: https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/blob/32eebae59fe953057a6d60d4eeaf4c1bb7e9c0b9/polaris-core/src/main/java/io/polaris/core/persistence/PolarisMetaStoreManagerImpl.java#L588 -- it only gets assigned `CATALOG_MANAGE_ACCESS` and `CATALOG_MANAGE_METADATA` without `CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT`.

This can be solved by either omitting the `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` header when creating the table or granting the `catalog_admin` (which is granted to the default `root` via the `service_admin` PrincipalRole by default) with the privilege `CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6Hty4J/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I'm interpreting the header as a signal for credential vending or remote signing capabilities. Perhaps the Polaris permission model is making the assumption that setting the header means requesting for table access.

This is an area that's probably worth adding more explicit documentation for. The ground truth for privilege requirements can be found in [PolarisAuthorizableOperation.java](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/blob/32eebae59fe953057a6d60d4eeaf4c1bb7e9c0b9/polaris-core/src/main/java/io/polaris/core/auth/PolarisAuthorizableOperation.java#L92):

      CREATE_TABLE_DIRECT(TABLE_CREATE),
      CREATE_TABLE_DIRECT_WITH_WRITE_DELEGATION(EnumSet.of(TABLE_CREATE, TABLE_WRITE_DATA)),

And the relationship between direct privileges vs inheritance through ""super-privileges"" can be found in [PolarisAuthorizer.java](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/blob/32eebae59fe953057a6d60d4eeaf4c1bb7e9c0b9/polaris-core/src/main/java/io/polaris/core/auth/PolarisAuthorizer.java#L137):

    SUPER_PRIVILEGES.putAll(
        TABLE_CREATE,
        List.of(
            CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT, CATALOG_MANAGE_METADATA, TABLE_CREATE, TABLE_FULL_METADATA));
    ....
    SUPER_PRIVILEGES.putAll(TABLE_WRITE_DATA, List.of(CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT, TABLE_WRITE_DATA));


So you need only `TABLE_CREATE` ""or better"" to `createTable` without setting `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation`.

And you need both `TABLE_CREATE` and `TABLE_WRITE` (""or better"") to `createTable` if you *do* set `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation`.

In both cases Polaris will be able to write to the metadata store and write the metadata JSON file itself, but the difference is that if you specify `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation`, Polaris will also return a storage credential directly in the `createTable` response, the same way it would for `loadTable`. This is because in some scenarios when Spark creates the Iceberg table, it will rely on the credential in the response to then subsequently perform further actions on the table, instead of doing a separate `loadTable` request after creation to obtain storage credentials.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6HvDsw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is an interesting behavior. In this case, Polaris must vend credentials with the `createTable` response for the metadata JSON file, which requires additional permissions. 
I found the branching logic for with/without the `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` header in the [`createTable` function](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/blob/32eebae59fe953057a6d60d4eeaf4c1bb7e9c0b9/polaris-service/src/main/java/io/polaris/service/catalog/IcebergCatalogAdapter.java#L171-L202)

The `ROOT` principal has `TABLE_CREATE` permission but not `TABLE_WRITE_DATA` permission, which means only `createTable` without `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` is allowed.
* `createTable` without `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` requires only `TABLE_CREATE`
* `createTable` with `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` requires `TABLE_CREATE` and `TABLE_WRITE_DATA`

### `ROOT` permissions 
`ROOT` is granted the following permissions 
* `CATALOG_MANAGE_METADATA`
* `CATALOG_MANAGE_ACCESS`

But not `CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT` permission, as you mentioned above. 

`TABLE_CREATE` is allowed since `ROOT` has `CATALOG_MANAGE_METADATA` permission.

`TABLE_WRITE_DATA` is not allowed since `ROOT` has neither `CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT` or `TABLE_WRITE_DATA` permissions.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

We noticed after have Polaris running for sometime with Eclipse Link, the connection pool created by Polaris got tear down and Polaris is not trying to create a new connection pool after that.



### To Reproduce

Have Polaris with Eclipse link and Postgres backend running for sometime (sent couple requests in to bring up the connection pool then have it sit idle for sometime), once the connection on the backend is all gone (somehow keepalive is not happening or it is working but potential deadlock blocked there),  we will then be able to see the following:

Sample curl request:
```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/principals' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer principal:root;password:2c81396d261e1970c1527475e7ae7807;realm:default-realm;role:ALL'
```

Logs on the server side after submitted this request (stuck here until curl timed out):
```

```

Check the backend database to see if there are any established connections and it shows none:
```
SELECT pid, age(clock_timestamp(), query_start), usename, query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE query != '<IDLE>' AND query NOT ILIKE '%pg_stat_activity%' and application_name = 'PostgreSQL JDBC Driver'
ORDER BY query_start desc;
```

This leads me to think somehow the connection pool created by Polaris got teared down and Polaris is unable to recreate the connection pool. However, from the following steps, I verified connection pool recreation is for sure there under happy path:
1. Redeploy polaris to clear the deadlock state
2. Submitted a request to bring up the connection pool
3. Restarted backend metastore
4. Verified connection pool is gone on backend metastore
5. Submitted a request to bring up the connection pool and got connection pool being gone. Then at the same time, Polaris will then try to bring up a new connection pool based on log messages
6. Submitted another request and this time it goes through

With above steps, for sure the connection pooling recreation is working. However, when the poential deadlock came, the connection pooling recreation became no longer possible.

### Actual Behavior

_No response_

### Expected Behavior

_No response_

### Additional context

Here are a couple of log lines that came before the shared logs above (generated by background thread I am assuming also indicated it is trying to keep connection alive but failed to do so:

This is the description of delete catalog:

AWS S3 has hard limits for each prefix index.
The best way to scale with S3 is to create a random prefix for each object/file.

This is described here:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/improve-operational-efficiencies-of-apache-iceberg-tables-built-on-amazon-s3-data-lakes/ (`write.object-storage.enabled'=true`).

Below is an example:

bucket/<MURMUR3 S3 hash>/catalog/namespace/table/file1
bucket/<MURMUR3 S3 hash>/catalog/namespace/table/file2

This  strategy removes any hard limits concerns with S3 buckets.

For each catalog generate set random location prefix:

I would argue (and of course depends on the exact implementation details) that this should be possible (in theory).

Let's assume the catalog generates MURMUR3 hash (8 hex characters).
Wouldn't the catalog be able to ignore the first 8 characters and '/'.

`bucket/<random_location_prefix>/namespace/table` is not going to work - agreed.

but how about:
`bucket/<random_prefix>/catalog/namespace/table`

I see no reason why RBAC cannot be enforced with this approach.

1. The credential vending needs a fixed prefix. The random prefix (no matter if the length is fixed or not) will post a security risk for credential vending. 
2. It is a challenge for the table maintenance job like RemoveOrphanfile.

Instead, we can put the the hash string after the table location, like the following example shows. This may be not as effective as the one you proposed in terms of path randomness, but it's still effective per our experience.

### Describe the bug

I'm on windows 11 with Docker Desktop v4.33.1

Running the command `docker build -t localhost:5001/polaris:latest .` results in an error after the change to the image was done in commit https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/commit/0f2c2a8acde387a8a107d30631a6496cc43abb13

If i revert the Dockerfile to the code before this commit, I can build the image. I've been able to reproduce this error along with a colleague where we are all on windows 11 using docker desktop to build the image.

### To Reproduce

1. Have Windows 11 as your base OS.
2. Have Docker Desktop installed. 
3. Open Terminal and traverse to the git repo location with the latest commit.
4. Run the command `docker build -t localhost:5001/polaris:latest .`

Masking/hiding is technically probably the more straght-forward part, but getting ""trust"" right is tricky.

A table (or view referencing such a table directly or indirectly) that has CLAC/RLAC enabled, must not be accessible to untrusted clients, simply because once you give those access, they technically see everything. Or the catalog would have to intercept (and rewrite) manifest-lists, manifest-files and data/delete files according to the user's privileges and R/CLAC rules (masking) - that's quite expensive.

However, if you have an engine/client that you _really trust_ to securely apply the CLAC/RLAC filters, the catalog can grant access to it and rely on the engine/client to do the right thing.

""Trust"" itself has very different meanings for different people. Some say they're fine with running queries only on that engine X, Y or Z. Others say that the engine must run on extremely locked down hardware, ensuring that malicious users must not even be able to use side-channel attacks to get (some) knowledge of the protected data.

Don't get me wrong, definitely don't wanna shoot this down or so - it's the opposite. Just saying, that there's a lot of work to do.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6JegKa/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Please describe.

Currently Polaris catalog only support RBAC that a problem when the authorization logic fits to ABAC.


### Describe the solution you'd like

My solution for that is making an OPA(Open Policy Agent) Plugin such that the catalog for every access control decision will retrieve from an opa server if this request should be allow or not. 

That will also make the catalog more suitable for different use cases regarding access control

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I’ve considered using the RBAC as ABAC but that will be complicate and not easy thing to do

Currently, I managed to deploy polaris locally (with gradlew) and my storage  in S3 as per the link here: https://polaris.io/#section/Quick-Start/Defining-a-Catalog 

I created a catalog as per the instructions and I can see the catalog is registered successfully inside the catalog. 

```
./polaris \
  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \
  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \
  catalogs \

  --default-base-location  s3://test-iceberg-us-demo/ \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::xxxxx:role/xxxxxx \
  quickstart_catalog
```

However, when I try to do a `spark.sql(""USE quickstart_catalog"")`, I get a 

```

```

### To Reproduce

1. Go to https://polaris.io/#section/Quick-Start/Defining-a-Catalog
2. Follow the set up
3. when you run the spark.sql(""USE quickstart_catalog"")
4. When you check the polaris logs, the internal error message is surfaced

### Actual Behavior

Should not error out and inform me I can use the quickstart_catalog

### Expected Behavior

Should not error out and inform me I can use the quickstart_catalog

### Additional context

Should not error out and inform me I can use the quickstart_catalog

1) If I use the default realm principal client ID and client secret, i
don't hit the 500 error. I was able to go until the step ""create or replace

It throws a Principal 'root' with activated PrincipalRoles '[]' and
activated ids '[2, 4]' is not authorized.


 2) But if i use the  quickstart_user client ID and client secret (as per
the guide), it doesnt work (hits the nullpointer still) .

 Using the curl command works with the quickstart_user client ID and client

Can I check also for the IAM role and S3 resource did u use a IAM role and
S3 from aws? Because if so how do we bind inside the S3 role ARN the
snowflake_user_arn or snowflake_external_id from my catalog running locally?

This is based on the gradlew run. I haven't tried the docker method one.

comment,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/144,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6JTp5o,polaris,2303630952,144,NA,MonkeyCanCode,29619290,,,NA,2024-08-22T04:04:40Z,2024-08-22T04:04:40Z,"@sfc-gh-adlee So what I refers to as working was https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/main/docker-compose-jupyter.yml

Then back to your question regarding AWS ARN and S3 access. Here are what you will needed on AWS side:
1. S3 bucket
2. IAM policy that defined access to the S3 bucket in item 1
3. IAM role that is associated with the IAM policy created in item 2 with self trust relation when using same AWS account (aka self-assuming/self-trusting IAM role)
4. IAM user that is associated with IAM role created in item 3

Here is the reasoning, when Spark is accessing S3 via Polaris, it is using assume role instead of using `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` directly after successfully authed with Polaris with sufficient RBAC access (no needed to provide key and secret to spark but Polaris itself will need those). It is using the provided  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for user created in item 4 to invoke assumeRole which then use AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary token to assume that role created in item 3. Thus, Spark can access S3 without needing to have the actual key/secret that has access to S3.

Here is the code that is doing this: https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/e89ff19dc18c3cd5a357461222a52b91e682f5d0/polaris-core/src/main/java/io/polaris/core/storage/aws/AwsCredentialsStorageIntegration.java#L40

Then for your specific error, I am assuming you didn't grant the RBAC correctly for that new principal. The curl command is just return a dummy OAUTH2 token after hitting the backend metastore (so as long as the auth is correct, it will return).

Then for `root` user, you won't be able to use that to create table by default as the `root` user doesn't have that type access. Out of box, `root` user has access to manage RBAC as well as managing catalogs. However, `root` user doesn't have access to create tables under catalog. 

You can use the following procedures to get a working setup (all steps are required as the following steps will create a new catalog, principle, catalog role, principle role, and associated all of those resources together...original source: https://polaris.io/#section/Quick-Start/Bootstrapping-Polaris):

### Describe the bug

[Iceberg REST spec defines](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/apache-iceberg-1.6.0/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml#L1489) the following two values for the `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` HTTP header:
* `vended-credentials`
* `remote-signing`

However, current Polaris examples / docs use the value of `true`, which does not match anything in the Iceberg REST spec.

Current code appears to treat any non-empty header as `vended-credentials`, which is not exactly correct.

### To Reproduce

### Actual Behavior

_No response_

Luckily, since the bug wasn't that the request handlers actually expected to parse `true` from the String, just that they only checked `!isNullOrEmpty` to assume it meant vended-credentials, it's forward-compatible if anyone is using the ""correct"" syntax.

We should try to update docs as quickly as possible to reduce the degree to which `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation: true` gets entrenched into various workflows or test scripts of anyone integrating with Polaris.

Indeed, it looks like the problem is that `registerTable` is the only thing in `BaseMetastoreCatalog` that tries to directly use the `ops.io()` immediately after building `ops = newTableOps(identifier)`.

Whereas other flows either deal with an existing Table entity and by calling `current()` will trigger a `doRefresh()` which will properly initialize the FileIO with StorageConfiguration-based credentials, or else will go through a `doCommit` which also initializes the FileIO with the right credentials, this `registerTable` flow will revert to the catalog's ""default"" FileIO.

The catalog's ""default"" FileIO is in some ways vestigial to make it easy for ""Local FileSystem"" based Java tests to work without having to mock out a fake credential-vending flow. We might want to refactor `BasePolarisCatalog` a bit to fast-fail if `BasePolarisTableOperations::io()` is ever used without being initialized with a `refreshIOWithCredentials` one way or another.

This will also require some consideration for how the `validateNoLocationOverlap` enforcement works, and also `validateLocationForTableLike` so that it can't be abused to load metadata JSON files residing outside of the StorageConfiguration's ALLOWED_LOCATIONS.

I'll try to draft a fix for this tomorrow.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6JeTw7/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Mostly just thinking out loud here for posterity - one problem is that since we wanted to leverage `BaseMetastoreCatalog` to avoid re-implementing all the `TableOperations` logic, there's potential for conflating things that are supposed to happen logically on the ""client-side"" vs on the ""service-side"".

Basically we run the base Iceberg CatalogTests and View equivalents in two modes:

- `PolarisRestCatalogIntegrationTest` - end-to-end logic that plumbs `CatalogTests` through a `RESTSessionCatalog` so that `BasePolarisCatalog` is only ever used for ""server-side"" actions (e.g. only needs to interact with metadata JSON files)
- `BasePolarisCatalogTest` - directly points `CatalogTests` at the `BasePolarisCatalog` as if it's a traditional client-side-defined Iceberg catalog where ""local"" Transaction objects are used and `TableOperations::io()` is used for the FileIOs that potentially interact with manifest files and manifest-list files

Roughly, there are three categories of tests to consider:

1. Tests that use the `BasePolarisCatalog` to obtain a ""client-local"" FileIO -- these should either manually create a FileIO for pre-creating data or can go through a config setting that forces `BasePolarisCatalog` to create a ""defaultFileIO"" using `catalogProperties`.
2. Tests which go through the full REST plumbing but need the ""server-side"" Catalog to still use special or mocked FileIO settings. For example, `PolarisSparkIntegrationTest` uses `S3MockContainer` and needs to be able to set `s3.endpoint` int he catalog config
3. Tests which go through the full REST plumbing and fully cooperate with ""standard"" credential-vending semantics and/or use only `file:///` paths. These should work without needing to fall back to `catalogProperties` nor rely on `defaultFileIO`

Right now these rely on a lot of silent fallthrough behaviors, but we should make them more explicit. Supporting (2) more explicitly may also be the key to supporting https://github.com/apache/polaris/issues/69 in a cleaner way.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6JoSwY/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Can you help provide some more insights to the following questions if any.

- limits to the number of catalogs we can create in a polaris instance
- Number of namespaces/sub namespaces a catalog can have
- catalog roles per namespace
- service principals.

We plan to create a catalog and then namespaces are our logical grouping . Each namespace would be associated with a catalog role which allows access to the namespace tables only. the catalog role will have an associated service principal. We would leverage the apis from the documentation to create the whole piece and hence the ask on the limits .","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6KBcmr/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* limits to the number of catalogs we can create in a polaris instance
  - Currently, there is no limit. You might hit practical limits on the metastore side depending on your implementation

* Number of namespaces/sub namespaces a catalog can have
  - Same as the above

* catalog roles per namespace
  - Same as the above

* service principals.
  - Currently, Polaris doesn't really have a concept of a service principal, but you can create as many principals as you wish.

As you can see, Polaris itself doesn't have hard limits on the number of entities you can create right now. But since everything is stored in the metastore, there could be practical limits on some entities. In particular, some checks we do to ensure path uniqueness or that catalog paths don't overlap are linear or worse time in the eclipse-link metastore.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6Olyjh/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have set the allowed location of the created catalog to S3 storage type using `s3://` prefix. When I run `remove_orphan_files` procedure in Spark, it results in an error message: `No FileSystem for scheme ""s3""`.

Removing the config and it still doesn't work. From my understanding, the remove_orphan_files operation involves file listing to determine which files should be removed, and the Spark procedure uses Hadoop FS to perform listing operations.

I have tried this procedure with other Iceberg catalogs, and it has the same problem when using the s3:// prefix.

Yup, I'm guessing the failure is triggered due to procedure is using the Spark Hadoop FS while other DML commands use the FileIO from the iceberg catalog.

To summarize, DML commands and procedures usually use `FileIO` object provided by the catalog for read and write files. However, the procedure `RemoveOrphanFile` uses the [Spark configuration](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/79620e198009fa243c278c66fd442d107b46206a/spark/v3.5/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/actions/DeleteOrphanFilesSparkAction.java#L356-L356) to get the FileSystem object for listing, which is a Hadoop s3a File System. It couldn't recognize the `s3://`. Solutions would be 
1. Using catalog `FileIO` instead of the File System from Spark config. `ResolvingFileIO` is the default one used by REST catalog, which delegates to `S3FileIO` in this case, [it supports `listPrefix`](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/79620e198009fa243c278c66fd442d107b46206a/aws/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/s3/S3FileIO.java#L299-L299). This requires code change in the procedure.
2. Using aws s3 client instead of Hadoop s3a client in Spark, I guess this only needs a config change, I'm not familiar with that though. Recommend to check with the Iceberg community.

It'd be ideal to use Iceberg `FileIO` in `removeOrphanFile`, so that we don't have to config Spark file system differently, which is a duplication to avoid. I will take a look at the Iceberg PR. 

We will still need a workaround at this moment though, as the Iceberg change and release will take a while. You can customize your iceberg lib of course, but not every user is able to do that. @dennishuo mentioned a workaround [here](https://apache-iceberg.slack.com/archives/C07HADW86HZ/p1724909442884259?thread_ts=1724680467.488829&cid=C07HADW86HZ).

```
implementation(""org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.4"")

Build with `ECLIPSELINK=true` (I changed this in the Dockerfile but there may be a better way)

Remember to run the bootstrap after to create the required tables in the persistence store
```java -jar /path/to/jar/polaris-service-all.jar bootstrap polaris-server.yml```

Afterwards, Polaris can be launched normally:

From the testing I done local, the min/init/max connection settings seems to be not working (it will set to max and not scale down as connection sitting idles for long time). I am using following sample settings:
```
<property name=""eclipselink.connection-pool.default.initial"" value=""1""/>
<property name=""eclipselink.connection-pool.default.min"" value=""10""/>
<property name=""eclipselink.connection-pool.default.max"" value=""64""/>

I am not sure if that is bug with this version of eclipselink or not. As your guys are adding this example for support, can we check above as well? 

Also, psql driver jar is not part of eclipselink extension, we may want to add a note for this as well. Even better, what if we add support for allow people to load the jars they want dynamically via argument during build? E.g.
```
if (project.properties.get(""additionalDependencies"")) {
  dependencies { implementation(project(project.properties.get(""additionalDependencies""))) }
}

Please describe.

No

### Describe the solution you'd like

Extend the support in a catalog from Data to AI/ML models. The Polaris catalog could facilitate
1.  Storing metadata about models aiding in model discovery
2. Integration with MLFlow client
3. Model provenance
4. Mapping of Models to the data it operates on
5. Storing model performance metrics snapshots
6. Access control on models
7. Model and its data versioning
8. Custom properties associated with models
9. Integration with feature stores
10. Storage and access of policies associated with model usage
11.  Integration with workflow engines

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Have briefly looked at unity catalog, would like to see Polaris supporting AI/ML models too

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

Underscores is a valid symbol in the bucket name, [the doc ](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/buckets#naming)

> Bucket names can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Spaces are not allowed. Names containing dots require [verification](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/domain-name-verification).

The current approach uses  `java.net.URI`, which is not allowing to have underscores in the host name of URI. It leads to wrongly requested access boundaries, because the bucket name is being set as `null`.

### To Reproduce

```
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.22
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> String location = ""gs://test_bucket/iceberg/data""
location ==> ""gs://test_bucket/iceberg/data""

jshell> URI uri = uri.create(location);
uri ==> gs://test_bucket/iceberg/data

jshell> uri.getHost()
$3 ==> null
```

### Actual Behavior

The bucket name is set as `null`

### Expected Behavior

The bucket name is set as `test_bucket`

### Additional context

I guess this [class](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-storage/latest/com.google.cloud.storage.BlobId#com_google_cloud_storage_BlobId_fromGsUtilUri_java_lang_String_) from `com.google.cloud.storage` can be used instead
```
import com.google.cloud.storage.BlobId;
...
BlobId blob = BlobId.fromGsUtilUri(location);
String bucket = blob.getBucket();
String path = blob.getName();
...
```

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

When dropTable is called with `purgeRequested`, the Polaris server will create `Task`s in order to delete data files associated with the table being dropped. However, if the service dies before the tasks are completed they may not resume gracefully on startup. Some of that table's data files may not be cleaned up.

### To Reproduce

Call `dropTable` with `purgeRequested`, and kill the Polaris service before the relevant `Task`s complete.

### Actual Behavior

`Task`s are not resumed on startup

### Expected Behavior

`Task`s associated with a purge should reliably complete, or the user should be made aware that they cannot be completed

### Additional context

I've met with @collado-mike and others to discuss a long-term solution here, but it may take some time. In the interim, we discussed some workarounds and stopgaps.

Please describe.

_No response_

### Describe the solution you'd like

Apache Polaris provides metadata management for Apache Iceberg. From the authorization point of view, key features of Polaris include:

 - *RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):* Polaris supports RBAC for table and view-level operations. [See Documentation](https://polaris.io/#tag/Access-Control)
 - *Role Management:* Polaris allows the creation of Principals with roles like Data Engineer, Data Scientist, etc.
 - *Catalog Roles:* Specialized roles like Catalog Administrators, Catalog Readers, and Catalog Contributors can be defined to manage access to different parts of the data catalog.
 - *Granular Privileges:* Polaris provides fine-grained privileges for operations on Tables, Views, Namespaces, and Catalogs. Examples include `TABLE_CREATE`, `TABLE_READ_DATA`, `TABLE_WRITE_DATA`, `VIEW_CREATE`, `NAMESPACE_CREATE`, `CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT`, and more.
 - *Credential Vending:* Polaris vends credentials based on the specific table the user is trying to access.
 - *API for Role Management:* Polaris offers an API to manage grants for roles, allowing fine-tuned control over data access.

*Objective:*

To enhance the usability and security of Polaris for Apache Iceberg users, the request is to develop an Apache Ranger plugin that integrates Polaris' access control features with Apache Ranger. This integration will allow for centralized and consistent management of access policies, audit logging, and fine-grained access control across different tools used with Apache Iceberg.

*Use Cases:*

1. *Centralized Access Policy Management:*
 - Implement centralized and consistent management of access policies for data stored using Apache Iceberg across multiple tools and environments.

2. *Access Control for Data Engineering Workloads:*
 - Manage and control access to datasets used by Data Engineering workloads (e.g., Apache Spark) with a coarser-grained approach at the table level.

3. *Fine-Grained Access Control for Data Analysts:*
 - Provide fine-grained access control for Data Analysts using compute engines like Trino. This control can be enforced by leveraging the native Ranger Plugin in Trino, allowing for more granular control over data access at the table, view, or even column level.

4. *Centralized Access Auditing:*
 - Enable centralized collection and analysis of access audit logs across all tools used to access datasets in Iceberg, ensuring comprehensive auditing and compliance.

*Expected Deliverables:*
 - A fully functional Apache Ranger plugin for Polaris that supports the outlined use cases.
 - Documentation on how to configure and deploy the plugin.
 - Integration tests to ensure the plugin works as expected with Apache Iceberg and other tools like Apache Spark and Trino.
 - A detailed user guide explaining how to use the plugin for managing access control in various scenarios.

*References*

[PolarisAuthorizer Class on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/main/polaris-core/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/core/auth/PolarisAuthorizer.java): The `PolarisAuthorizer` class provides the core authorization logic in Polaris, which can be leveraged by the Apache Ranger plugin.

Most Apache projects and Open Source projects like Presto (https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/hive-security.html#ranger-based-authorization) , Trino (https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/22674), Apache Hive (https://github.com/apache/ranger/tree/master/hive-agent), Apache Kafka (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/RANGER/Kafka+Plugin have native integration with Apache Ranger.

So I raised a PR for helm in the past which I am using job to perform bootstrap: https://github.com/apache/polaris/pull/135/files#diff-922229e69535a3fb282010bf5c16aa261f558539c874ac0cf8205b5762790cf4

Now back to your question, the container will be running in `server` mode by default. Then with persisted backend, your backend won't be bootstrapped out of box. To bootstrap it, you will need to ssh into the container and run the following wrapper command (which is what I am using in the helm chart above):
```
/app/bin/polaris-service bootstrap polaris-server.yml
```

Alternative, you can use the following java -jar command as well:
```
java -jar /path/to/jar/polaris-service-all.jar bootstrap polaris-server.yml
```

Hello, so this error is expected as Polaris itself doesn't package any jdbc driver which is actually needed when using a jdbc backend via eclipse link. This needs to be added as part of the EclipseLink build file instead.

Not really, here is what you can do:
```
# update extension/persistence/eclipselink/build.gradle.kts
## add the following within dependencies block
implementation(""org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.4"")
```

Then build the image again.

### Describe the bug

[PolarisApplicationConfig](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/cc58730a0c626dba574c2577b32081b17b97b7a8/polaris-service/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/config/PolarisApplicationConfig.java#L117) defines defaultRealm and allows overriding it trough configuration file. [DefaultContextResolver](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/cc58730a0c626dba574c2577b32081b17b97b7a8/polaris-service/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/context/DefaultContextResolver.java#L52) ignores a value from the configuration. 

### To Reproduce

0. Setup an eclipse link with a database name which is different from `default-realm`
1. Set `defaultRealm`  in the configuration yaml file
2. Try to connect to get the token without setting `realm` explicitly in the request's headers
3. Polaris returns an error: 
```
FATAL: database 'default-realm' does not exist

### Actual Behavior

Configuration setting is not a source of truth for the all components

### Expected Behavior

Configuration setting defines a default value for the all components

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

When dropping a table, the data folder is deleted but the metadata folder remains with the metadata.json files it contains.

### To Reproduce

Using postgres as the metadata store, and GCS for storage.

The queries below (executed in Trino) create a schema/namespace in the catalog, creates a table from some sample data in BigQuery(the data can be from anywhere really), copies the data to a second table, then drops the second table.

```
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS polarisgcs.test_schema1 WITH (location = 'gs://bucket-iceberg-polaris/polaris/test_schema1');

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS polarisgcs.test_schema1.test1 WITH (format='PARQUET', partitioning = ARRAY['domain_id', 

'day(date)']) AS SELECT date, domain_id, country, resource_id, metric1 FROM bq.sample.table1;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS polarisgcs.test_schema1.test2 WITH (format='PARQUET', partitioning = ARRAY['domain_id', 'day(date)']) AS SELECT date, domain_id, country, resource_id, metric1 FROM polarisgcs.test_schema1.test1;

DROP TABLE polarisgcs.test_schema1.test2;
```

### Actual Behavior

files in `{table name}/metadata`  are not deleted
```
>gsutil ls gs://bucket-iceberg-polaris/polaris/test_schema1/test2*/**
gs://bucket-iceberg-polaris/polaris/test_schema1/test2-139045f9cbde4d1f9ef643141621a208/metadata/00000-af991efc-4628-4703-95c4-338a721eada7.metadata.json

```

### Expected Behavior

All files in the dropped table's path are deleted.

### Additional context

postgres as backing metadata store
GCS storage

It appears Localstack has STS support.

Please describe.

I would like to ideally only configure 1 endpoint for all of my iceberg catalog readers and delegate through polaris.



### Describe the solution you'd like

I would like to be able to support external catalog delegating via rest endpoints. This would allow all external iceberg catalog locations to be managed in polaris but not have to directly integrate with multiple catalog endpoints client side.

Once an external catalog rest endpoint location is added to the polaris catalog, any existing integrations immediately are able to read that data if they have permission to do so. It may be possible to simply forward exiting oauth credentials or give polaris new credentials to use to talk to the external catalog.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

In spark for example you'd need to individually register each catalog endpoint namespace config among multiple clients or code bases. Doing it once on the polaris catalog would simplify integration.

When sending an http request with an expired token, 5xx is returned instead of 401.

### To Reproduce

1. Enable JWTBroker.
2. Generate a token with credentials.
3. Wait 60 minutes.
4. Send a request with the expired token. Returns 5xx instead of 401.

Please describe.

In https://github.com/apache/polaris/pull/278 we added a post-auth rate limiter. We discussed that there should also likely be a pre-auth one because Polaris will have already done some work by the time that rate limiter runs.

### Describe the solution you'd like

A pre-auth rate limiter. This doesn't necessarily have to be implemented _in_ Polaris, but could also be in the form of Docker/Kubernetes config for rate limiting at Envoy/Nginx.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

In the following code:

https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/b0eb0250c9ea564dfd85b101707e12341d9a723e/polaris-core/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/core/persistence/PolarisEntityResolver.java#L291

```java
for (PolarisEntityCore resolveEntity : toResolve) {
  // get associate active record
  PolarisEntityActiveRecord activeEntityRecord = activeRecordIt.next();

  // if this entity has been dropped (null) or replaced (<> ids), then fail validation
  if (activeEntityRecord == null || activeEntityRecord.getId() != resolveEntity.getId()) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

If there are no elements in `activeRecordIt`, calling `.next()` will throw an exception before reaching the `activeEntityRecord == null` check.

Should we add a `.hasNext()` check before calling `.next()`? 

If this is indeed an issue, it seems like a trivial fix, and I’d be happy to address it.

      PolarisEntityActiveRecord activeEntityRecord = activeRecordIt.next();

      // if this entity has been dropped (null) or replaced (<> ids), then fail validation
      if (activeEntityRecord == null || activeEntityRecord.getId() != resolveEntity.getId()) {
        return false;
      }
    }`

If there are no elements in activeRecordIt, then the .next() will throw an exception before reaching below. 
`      activeEntityRecord == null 
`
Should we check for `.hasNext()` before calling `.next()`. 

If it is indeed an issue, it seems to be an trivial fix and I am happy to do it. Please assign it to me.

The code seems to assume that `toResolve` will always have the same length as  `activeRecordIt` and that they will always be aligned (e.g. the Nth element in one corresponds to the Nth element in the other).

If this assumption is true, then we don't need the `hasNext` check, though we could maybe clarify this with a comment or improve readability.

If this assumption isn't true, the code needs to be fixed in more ways than with just a `hasNext` check.

I think the issue is this: whether or not the above assumption is true depends on the metastore implementation. Perhaps we could make  `lookupEntityActiveBatch` return a `Map`, but I'm not sure whether or not we want to change the interface for this. Another approach we could take is adding a test to ensure the assumption is always true.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6OFTpq/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As most companies, we already have a central identity management system. All enterprise systems must integrate with this IdP.
 
Currently we are missing a guide on how to configure Polaris with an external IdP / Token Service. Having guides for standard IdPs such as Entra ID would be great.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Provide a straight forward way to configure Polaris with standard IdPs and provide documentation on a minimal configuration for commonly used IdPs. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

There is no alternative. Enterprises require an IdP integration.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

When using a host where the port can be inferred the CLI still tries to put the default 8181 at the end, which makes the call error/hang.

### To Reproduce

`./polaris --host some.hosted.url --client-id <client-id> --client-secret <client-secret> catalogs list`


### Actual Behavior

Returns back `http://some.hosted.url:8181/api/management/v1` & `http://some.hosted.url:8181/api/catalog/v1`


### Expected Behavior

Expecting the urls to be `http://some.hosted.url/api/management/v1` & `http://some.hosted.url/api/catalog/v1`

### Additional context

The CLI code that needs updating is here - https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/main/regtests/client/python/cli/polaris_cli.py#L110-L112

If a host is added but no port is given it should not try and use the default one.

I can get the CLI working if I pass in the target port, but the host URL for the ingress service that I created for my K8 cluster can also be used without passing in the port and it was that pathway that I was trying to get to work. The only way it did was by removing the need for the port in the URL created by the CLI.

I am not quite sure I am following. For k8s Ingress, you will only be able to use port 80 or 443 (don't think it is allowed to be changed). Now assuming we are using 443 and have a path that is mapped to the service 8181 for Polaris, you should still be able to access Polaris on port 443 via CLI when hitting the ingress instead of the pod directly. Maybe I am missing something here. Do you mind adding in a bit more details such as the sample ingress config etc. ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6OzIwL/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The following works fine - `./polaris --host some.hosted.url --port 80 --client-id <client-id> --client-secret <client-secret> catalogs list` for me. So this really isn't a bug anymore. 

What I was trying to explain (pretty badly 😆 ) is that the above creates a URL like so `http://some.hosted.url:80/api/catalog/v1` -- but the URL `http://some.hosted.url/api/catalog/v1` also works for talking to Polaris for my setup (which I've tested). The later configuration isn't supported in the CLI as it always need a port. I thought maybe it would be worth handling that use case, but passing in the port is fine.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

When creating a catalog using the CLI, a CreateCatalogRequest is created, and a CatalogEntity gets persisted in the underlying storage. During this process, the IcebergCatalogAdapter#getConfig (corresponding to the api/v1/config) is invoked, which fetches the catalog name surfaced in the warehouse field and returns properties (https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#catalog-properties) for overrides if applicable.

However, when creating a catalog for the first time (assuming it was not done using the Polaris CLI), there is no existing catalog unless you bypass the api/v1/config call and directly invoke catalog creation, similar to the CLI (as seen in regtests). For example, when using the Java core API, the process first fetches the config during catalog build (org.apache.iceberg.rest.RESTSessionCatalog.initialize) to determine if any overrides are required. This results in the error:


`Exception in thread ""main"" org.apache.iceberg.exceptions.RESTException: Unable to process: Unable to find warehouse XXXX 
`

I am forced to first create the catalog using the Polaris CLI and cannot achieve the same via the REST endpoint by specifying the warehouse location in the configuration.

Would returning something like {""defaults"":{},""overrides"":{}} be a solution in this case? Also, why is it that the warehouse field requires the catalog name instead of allowing a direct reference to locations like S3 or Blob storage?

Is this expected behavior; where we must first create the catalog using the Polaris CLI? 
Or did I overlook something?

Thanks in advance.


### To Reproduce

Use Java Core API to create a Catalog. 

### Actual Behavior

If Catalog unknown to Polaris, Error is raised when creating a new catalog (NOT FOUND)

### Expected Behavior

Empty Result ?

The Iceberg REST specification is intentionally scoped to operate at the table and namespace level, treating any concepts beyond that as implementation-specific details.

Catalog server implementations, such as Polaris, may introduce additional layers(e.g., catalog) beyond namespaces. While these layers can be inferred from the `warehouse` field in the `config` endpoint, such implementations are neither standardized nor mandated by the Iceberg REST specification.

With that, users cannot rely on the Iceberg REST client to create a Polaris catalog, as it does not have knowledge of Polaris-specific concepts or higher-level abstractions. To create Polaris catalogs, the Polaris REST API or CLI should be used. This separation ensures that implementation-specific details remain decoupled from the standardized REST API.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

The `catalog_admin` catalog role is intended to manage access privileges within a given catalog. The `catalog_admin` can create CatalogRoles and grant those roles privileges. However, as is, the `catalog_admin` cannot grant those CatalogRoles to PrincipalRoles.

The `service_admin` principal role manages Principals and PrincipalRoles, but is intended to be distinct from the `catalog_admin` in that the `service_admin` cannot grant privileges to catalog-level entities. This includes granting CatalogRoles to PrincipalRoles.

Thus, the only way to grant PrincipalRoles to catalog-level entities is for the `service_admin` to also be the `catalog_admin` for every catalog. This defeats the entire purpose of keeping these roles separate, which was to allow admins to separate responsibilities and prevent a single set of credentials from having the ability to access all data in any catalog within a realm. 

### To Reproduce

1. As `service_admin`, create a Catalog and grant the `catalog_admin` role to another PrincipalRole
2. As a member of this PrincipalRole, create a CatalogRole and attempt to grant it to a third PrincipalRole

Please describe.

By default, a principal that has a `catalog_admin` role in a catalog cannot list principal roles using the API. The `catalog_admin`'s responsibility is managing privileges and access to the catalog roles in a catalog. After fixing https://github.com/apache/polaris/issues/359 , the `catalog_admin` has the ability to grant a catalog role to a principal role, but has no ability to see the list of available principal roles. This may be ok for cases where a principal has both the `service_admin` and the `catalog_admin` roles, but if there's an enforced separation, the lack of privilege to list principal roles is a hindrance.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The authorization model typically requires a catalog to be in the scope of a request in order to detect that user has `catalog_admin` on the specified catalog. However, PrincipalRoles are not tied to a catalog, so it's difficult for the current authorization workflow to know if the current user does have admin privilege on any catalog. We can consider a separate API, where the `/principal_roles` endpoint is prefixed by catalog, but that feels cumbersome - especially if the caller is an admin on multiple catalogs.

A more likely solution would be to manage a special PrincipalRole that has limited privileges on PrincipalRoles (and possibly Principals) that a user is automatically added to when granted `catalog_admin`.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

Hello,
Maybe I am wrong and this is an expected behavior.

If there is no AWS_REGION setted in the environnement where Polaris is running (inMemory), the action of creating a catalog throw an error during the initialization of the STS Client. 



### To Reproduce

- Do not have AWS_REGION setted in environnement running Polaris
- start Polaris in mode ""InMemory"" (metaStoreManagerFactory == InMemoryPolarisMetaStoreManagerFactory)
- after Polaris is started with success
- create a catalog (with curl by example)
- STSClient fail during instantiation in polaris-service/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/PolarisApplication.java line 160 (metaStoreManagerFactory)



### Actual Behavior

- In polaris-service/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/PolarisApplication.java
- line 160 the PolarisStorageIntegrationProviderImpl will try to intantiate by default a AWS stsClient
- without AWS_REGION setted, it's failing

### Expected Behavior

- Maybe let the ""Polaris Core"" storage implementation fully manage this STS client (why is it instantiated in the ""Polaris Service"" ?)
- Maybe set a default Region in the STSbuilder to avoid an error ?


### Additional context

In case of a GCP or Azure deployment, AWS_REGION should not be mandatory.

### Describe the bug

With proper settings, spark can fail on credential vending when performing `remove_orphan_files`. This seems to be related to https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7914. 

Here is the slack thread for this discussion: https://apache-iceberg.slack.com/archives/C07HADW86HZ/p1729527019849439

Also, this operation works when using Trino with vended-credentials-enabled enabled.

### To Reproduce

1. Setup proper settings for Spark to work with Polaris
2. Ensure spark client can perform DDL/DML and couple data ops on Iceberg table based on settings from step 1
3. Perform remove_orphan_files within spark

### Actual Behavior

Spark will first reported `No FileSystem for scheme ""s3""` as it is trying to use HadoopFileIO. After manually set the `spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl` to `org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem`. If the client has S3 credential with needed access, it will work. However, if through credential vending from Polars, it can fail (in this case, client doesn't have S3 credential).



### Expected Behavior

Spark should use credential vending then perform remove_orphan_files and no manual specify of `spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl` should be needed.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

## Overview
Polaris server docker container built for the amd64 (x64) architecture errors out with code 500 on receiving a catalog creation request.

### Error Message
```
java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast java.util.ImmutableCollections$List12 to java.util.ImmutableCollections$ListN
```

### Create Catalog Request Body
```
{
    ""name"": ""catalog-name"",
    ""type"": ""INTERNAL"",
    ""readOnly"": false,
    ""storageConfigInfo"": {
        ""storageType"": ""AZURE"",
        ""tenantId"": ""<azure-tenant-id>""
    },
    ""properties"": {
        ""default-base-location"": ""abfss://<path-to-catalog-directory>""
    }
}
```

## Additional Facts
- Running it with or without persistence has no effect.
- The build for arm64 (same code) handles the create catalog request just fine (201 created).
- The last time I built a Polaris container for amd64 that didn't have this problem was on 13th September 2024. I can't find out precisely which commit it was. My guess is that a later commit has caused this bug.

### To Reproduce

- Fetch latest `main` branch of `apache/polaris`
- Build the docker container for `amd64` arch
  ```
  cd polaris
  docker build --platform linux/amd64 .
  ```
- Run Polaris server
  ```
  docker run -p 8181:8181 <image-id>
  ```
- Send a create catalog request with cURL
  ```
  curl --location 'http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/catalogs' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
      ""name"": ""catalog-name"",
      ""type"": ""INTERNAL"",
      ""readOnly"": false,
      ""storageConfigInfo"": {
          ""storageType"": ""AZURE"",
          ""tenantId"": ""<azure-tenant-id>""
      },
      ""properties"": {
          ""default-base-location"": ""abfss://<path-to-catalog-directory>""
      }
  }'
  ```

### Actual Behavior

Polaris server returns error code 500 with the stack trace printed above.

### Expected Behavior

Polaris server should create the catalog normally and return code 201 (created).

### Additional context

_No response_

@shantanu-dahiya I am assuming when you said it is not working in amd64, that is probably running on a remote server with modify configure such as the one mentioned above. 

This seems to be from https://github.com/apache/polaris/commit/413eca7147fc239d7748ae8c3b9a336e6174b956#diff-bdd5439826dd8ef9b7999590b9756ba570967ece75f9467b26af201b4c88ab18 where we are doing casting:
```
    if (config.defaultValue instanceof Boolean) {
      return config.cast(Boolean.valueOf(String.valueOf(value)));
    } else if (config.defaultValue instanceof List<?>) {
      return config.cast(List.copyOf((List<?>) value));
    } else {
      return config.cast(value);
    }
```

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

The adls.sas-token key:value being emitted is adls.sas-token.{account_host}:{sas-token} which works in Spark client but not other clients like PyIceberg [#1146](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-python/issues/1146#issuecomment-2421306564). 

To support more clients Polaris should also set: 
 - adls.sas-token (without the account-host) 
 - adls.account-name
 - adls.account_host


### To Reproduce

1. Use PyIceberg 

```python
from pyiceberg.catalog import load_catalog
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.compute as pc
import pyarrow.parquet as pq

catalog = load_catalog(
    **{
        ""type"": ""rest"",
        ""header.X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation"": ""vended-credentials"",
        ""uri"": f""https://{account}.snowflakecomputing.com/polaris/api/catalog"",
        ""credential"": f""{principal_client_id}:{principal_secret}"",
        ""warehouse"": catalog_name,
        ""scope"": role,
        ""token-refresh-enabled"": ""true"",
        ""py-io-impl"": ""pyiceberg.io.fsspec.FsspecFileIO"",
    }
)

table = catalog.load_table(f""{catalog_namespace}.{catalog_namespace_tablename}"")
tablescan = table.scan()
df = tablescan.to_arrow()
```

Please describe.

[OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io/) is an open standard for reporting and collecting lineage information about processing jobs (i.e., which data sets were inputs to a processing job and which datasets were output). OpenLineage libraries are typically modeled as listeners or before/after hooks that are triggered by running processing jobs and have engine-specific code that collects information about the job and the datasets. That information is serialized as JSON and transmitted to a well-defined endpoint that either processes and stores that information or modifies and relays it to another endpoint.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Polaris is a good candidate for a proxying lineage endpoint because it has a canonical view of the datasets being processed and can augment the lineage payload with useful data. This is especially true when Polaris is used to access External catalogs, where the authoritative metadata lives somewhere else. 

Spark or other OpenLineage clients can only report information about the datasets that can be gleaned from the client - e.g., the namespace of the data will be the Polaris endpoint that was used to access the data. The name of the catalog will be whatever name assigned to the catalog in that particular application (e.g., a user might configure the catalog as either `spark.sql.catalog.polaris` or `spark.sql.catalog.iceberg`). A table might have been renamed or moved from another catalog.

Polaris, however, knows exactly where the dataset originated and can use the table metadata's UUID field to uniquely identify the dataset. It also knows the snapshot information (datasets can be versioned in OpenLineage) as well as the schema, table properties, and other information that could be reported as an OpenLineage facet. 

Polaris doesn't make sense as a container for lineage information, as parsing and storing that information is not cheap. However, there is already precedence for an [OpenLineage proxy](https://openlineage.io/docs/development/ol-proxy/), which can be used to augument the lineage information and pass it on to another service ([Marquez](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez) is the reference implementation of the OpenLineage server endpoint).

Please describe.

User management is complicated and can scale to thousands or tens of thousands of users for large enterprises. Group membership is frequently dynamic and privileges tied to group membership needs to be able to reflect group membership changes immediately.

Large enterprises typically use identity provider services, such as Okta, LDAP, or Google, to manage users and roles. These central IdPs are typically relied upon to communicate user authentication and group membership so that an administrator needs to make changes in a single central location and know that all peripheral applications will see those changes immediately. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

SSO and support for Federated Users and Federated Roles would allow defining users and roles as ""federated"" so that token generation and role membership is disallowed through the Polaris management APIs. I see the following changes being implemented:

1. Support for multiple `Authenticator`s to be configured - an admin could potentially have multiple IdPs that should be trusted to generate auth tokens. These tokens need to be inspected and validated in Polaris, potentially by making an API call to the IdP or by validating an encryption signature in a JWT.
2. Extending the authentication flow to support just-in-time Principal creation - when a `TokenBroker` parses a token and returns a user that doesn't have a principal entity, one should be created from the token info. The Principal should be marked as `federated`  in its `internal_properties`. A `federated` Principal does not have any clientId/secret stored and cannot generate a token in the `/tokens` API.
3. Extending the authentication flow to support just-in-time PrincipalRole creation and assignment - when a `TokenBroker` parses a token, the scopes defined in the token should translate into PrincipalRole membership. These roles may not exist in Polaris, so should be created. The `AuthenticatedPrincipal` will implicitly have membership in these `PrincipalRole`s. The `PrincipalRole` should be marked as `federated` in its `internal_properties`. A `federated` PrincipalRole cannot be granted to non-`federated` Principals. 
4. `federated` Principals also cannot be granted membership to a non-`federated` PrincipalRoles - the tokens generated by the IdP will never include a non-`federated` PrincipalRole, so granting membership doesn't make sense.
5. Both `federated` Principals and PrincipalRoles must have a `federation_source` - a `federated` Principal should only be granted access to PrincipalRoles that are defined for the same `federation_source`. A naming convention, such as a source prefix, should be considered to avoid name clashing of Principals and PrincipalRoles. It would be necessary to map scopes and usernames present in the token to the expected name of the created Principal/PrincipalRole.

We are interested in using the vended credentials for Orphan File cleanup. However it seems that currently the provided vended credentials never allow listing. 
I see the infrastructure supports passing PolarisStorageActions.LIST which would allow this, but no caller seems to pass this in from what I can tell.

Allow users to add a permission to the catalog role that enables file listing which will then ensure the vended credentials include the list operation permissions.

Cross-version tests (or backwards/forwards/migration compatibility tests)  are a good idea!
SQL schema migration however complicates things, especially in a distributed / horizontally scalable system w/ rolling upgrades.

Re cross-version tests (backwards/forwards compatibility + rolling upgrades), we do have something like that in Nessie, where we run REST services from older releases and test the newest client (on `main`) against it, and older clients against the newest REST service (on `main`). It requires quite a bit of class-loading trickery though. With Iceberg/Java (which we don't use in those tests in Nessie) it would be quite hard, because Iceberg/Java and especially the Azure SDK keep resources like threads and thread-locals around, which cause class leaks that then cause OOMs - not great.

However, testing relevant things (persistence is one) in isolation should be doable - as dedicated / isolated tests.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6T9QBi/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yeah, I think it will be complicated to set up true cross-version tests.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

While `[Inheritable]ThreadLocal`s are relatively easy to start with to pass along request related information, `ThreadLocal`s come with a non-negligible cost and maintenance burden:

* TLs can cause very hard to detect memory leaks as objects (and classes!) are (often permanently) attached to a thread.
* TLs and their usage are hard to test
* (The use of) TLs can accidentally share data across requests
* Use of TLs becomes complex and hard to reason about

The proper way of sharing _request_ related information is to use CDI's `@RequestScoped` beans.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The support for refreshing vended-credentials has been added with the new version of Iceberg, i.e. 1.7.0.
But, this API will need to be implemented in Polaris.

Here's the script I posted in the PyIceberg issue

```python
#%%

import httpx
import polars as pl
from pyiceberg.catalog import load_catalog

# Assumes this catalog exists and credentials stored in
#  .pyiceberg.yaml
# Possibly created using https://github.com/JasperHG90/dagster-pyiceberg-example-polaris/blob/main/scripts/set_up_catalog.py
catalog = load_catalog(
    name=""dagster_example_catalog"",
)

# %% Create a namespace

catalog.create_namespace(""example"")

# %% Create data and add to table

df = pl.from_dict({
    ""a"": [1, 2, 3],
    ""b"": [4, 5, 6]
}).to_arrow()

catalog.create_table(
    identifier=""example.table"",
    schema=df.schema
)

# %% This will return 'False'

catalog.table_exists(""example.table"")

# %% But querying the 'table exists' Polaris endpoint  returns 200

catalog_client = httpx.Client(
    base_url=""http://polaris:8181/api/catalog/v1"",
    headers={
        ""Authorization"": ""Bearer principal:root;realm:default-realm"",
        ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"",
    }
)

# See endpoint here: https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/rest-catalog-open-api/#tag/Catalog-API/operation/tableExists
resp = catalog_client.head(
    url=""dagster_example_catalog/namespaces/example/tables/table""
)

resp.status_code # 200
```

This should work with any Polaris instance I suppose. The devcontainer that I use can be found [here](https://github.com/JasperHG90/dagster-pyiceberg-example-polaris/tree/main/.devcontainer).

### Actual Behavior

It returns a <200> status code.

### Expected Behavior

It should return a <204> status code.

### Additional context

N/A

### System information

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

When using Polaris with S3 (without KMS), everything is working fine (I can create Iceberg table from spark-sql on Polaris).

However, when I enable S3 KMS, I get:

```
ServerError: S3Exception: User: arn:aws:sts::601864557682:assumed-role/cep-analytics-platform-role-dev-polaris-catalog/snowflake is not authorized to perform: kms:GenerateDataKey on resource: arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:601864557682:key/401edca7-d545-4907-9c9f-2695305beb5e because no session policy

```

It seems that we have a missing security configuration to use with KMS.

### To Reproduce

Just use S3 KMS with Polaris.

### Actual Behavior

It works fine without KMW, but fails with S3 KMS enabled:

```

### Describe the bug

When creating a catalog that has an overlapping location with existing catalog, the service will return 400 ( BAD_REQUEST ), but it should be 409 ( CONFLICT )

### To Reproduce

Create a catalog with the same storage info location. the service will return 400 instead of 409.

### Actual Behavior

The Service returns 400 ( BAD_REQUEST ) when the new catalog has a overlapping location with existing catalog.

I'm expecting the service to return 409 ( CONFLICT ) similar to catalogName conflict when creating a catalog.

Thanks for reporting this issue. Upon checking the published API doc, 409 is when the catalog name already existed instead of conflicted path: https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/polaris-management-service/#operation/listCatalogs.

In fact, it is possible to use overlapped path for catalogs (not by default, but with featureConfiguration.ALLOW_OVERLAPPING_CATALOG_URLS set to true...default is false). 

@eric-maynard do you think we should change the status code for this one or update the code to include this as expected?

The chief concern was that someone could have existing catalogs that overlap. Besides that, they may just have some business justification for overlapping catalogs.

It's also important to point out that the restrictions against overlap do not provide ironclad guarantees as they stand. Even when catalogs are restricted s.t. they can't overlap, things you mentioned are already possible. Vended credentials can potentially read other data that is under a table's prefix. Two (EXTERNAL, by default IIRC) table locations can already overlap within a catalog.

Given this, and given the fact that some early users told us they wanted the option to have overlapping catalog locations, we added that flag.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6XTDA3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### To Reproduce
Followed the https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/quickstart/ guidance, and grant the `NAMESPACE_CREATE` privilege to catalog role `quickstart_catalog_role`.

Then start the program,  the program uses the rest catalog to access the Polaris, when creating the namespace, the Polaris server throw the exception.

In #312, we introduced metadata file cleanup logic into the `ManifestFileCleanupTaskHandler`, resulting in this handler being coupled with the cleanup logic for various file types. To improve maintainability and scalability in the future, it may be beneficial to create a base class for cleanup tasks and extract a dedicated batch file cleanup task handler from it.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

The only implementation of `PolarisDiagnostics` is a rather wrapper around Guava's `Preconditions`. Instance(s) of `PolarisDiagnostics` are carried around in a bunch of places. Just carrying around this instance to wrap the common `Preconditions` is unnecessary and leads to a lot of rather unnecessary code.

Replacing `PolarisDiagnostics(Impl)` with plain calls to `Preconditions` simplifies the code base in a lot of places.

`RuntimeException`s can always be caught properly at the service level or even below and handled accordingly. If finer grained handling is necessary, it's better to have implicit/injected tracing mechanisms in place, which is more robust and clearer than manual implementations.

The change should also use the opportunity and replace the rather cryptic messages with messages that provide meaningful information to users and ideally also actionable information.

NB: This change would also remove the last usage of the Jetbrains-annotations dependency.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/520/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Dropwizard + hk2 dependencies are currently used in `:polaris-service`, but `:polaris-service` also contains code needed for Quarkus, which causes conflicts.

Please describe.

Currently, the `PolarisMetaStoreManager` is the central interface to:

* Persistence and retrieval of persisted entities
* Storage and validation of secrets
* Privilege/grant management
* Entity cache validation/eviction/refresh
* Credential vending

#417 did some initial work to break up the interface into multiple interfaces so that components can depend on the specific functionality they require (i.e., persistence only or credential vending only), but the core interface itself still extends all of these interfaces and any metastore implementation must implement all of the methods in every interface. This makes it very difficult to swap out components for specialized tools, such as Vault for secrets management or redis for distributed caches or some policy-based grant manager.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The `PolarisMetaStoreManager` interface should no longer depend on any of the other interfaces and should contain persistence-only method definitions. This allows for persistence implementations to focus only on entity storage and retrieval, while other components can be responsible for implementing secrets management or credential vending. Furthermore, the cache logic should be refactored so that business components, such as the `PolarisServiceImpl` don't need to know anything about the entity cache, but can deal with the persistence interface directly. Caching may be implemented under the hood, but that should be transparent to the business components.

### Describe the bug

Implementations of operations that _create new_ entities, for example in `PolarisAdminService`, must always generate a _new_ technical ID and not use an _externally_ provided one.

Many places in the code base so something like this:
```java
  public PolarisEntity createCatalog(PolarisEntity entity) {
---
    long id =
        entity.getId() <= 0
            ? metaStoreManager.generateNewEntityId(getCurrentPolarisContext()).getId()
            : entity.getId();
...
    PolarisEntity polarisEntity =
        new PolarisEntity.Builder(entity)
            .setId(id)
            .setCreateTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis())
            .build();
...
```

The above pattern is error prone and can easily lead to issues like ID collisions later on.

Such implementation must really ensure that
1. the passed in ID is either not present or a not-present value (0)
2. the ID of the new entity must always be generated

Please describe.

The Dockerfile that sits at the repository root is rather insecure, especially this directive:

```dockerfile
COPY --chown=default:root . /app
```

With this directive it's a piece of cake to introduce a backdoor, build a hacked Polaris image, and distribute it.

Moreover, I'm concerned that people would think that this is the ""official"" Dockerfile for Polaris and would use it to push Polaris into production – since it sits at the repository root. This Dockerfile is also referenced in the main `README.md`, which contributes a bit more to branding it as the ""official"" thing.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I would like to suggest at least one of the following mitigation actions:

1. Clearly flag this Dockerfile for evaluation and/or testing purposes, e.g. by renaming it to `Dockerfile-dev`;
2. Better yet, move it to `dropwizard/service` to reduce its build context to just that module and also to reduce the risk of people using it in production.

Moving that Dockerfile would require changing the build steps though, since it won't be possible to build the entire code base anymore inside the docker build. An alternative was suggested a while ago in https://github.com/apache/polaris/pull/268 – _I think we need to revive that PR_. In particular, I don't see a sensible difference between building the code in the docker build vs copying pre-built artifacts, neither in terms of build reproducibility nor in terms of security (both are equally insecure, in fact).

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

Side note on the ""official"" Dockerfile: we don't have one yet, but ideally, that Dockerfile would check out a released tag and build it. Alternatively, it could download the released Maven artifacts from Maven Central. As a third option, it could copy the final artifacts from the local build directory – but that would only be safe if done in CI and triggered by a trusted user. 

In any case, I wouldn't recommend using the current strategy of building the local codebase inside the docker build as the strategy to use for future official Docker images.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/537/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Iceberg table maintenance allows users to focus on their business needs without worrying about table management. It ensures tables stay optimized, perform efficiently, and comply with governance policies like data retention. Common maintenance tasks include data compaction, metadata compaction, snapshot expiration, partition stats collection, and orphan file removal.
The Table Maintenance System (TMS) can operate independently from a catalog like Polaris, providing maintenance services even without direct integration. However, it functions more effectively when paired with a catalog. Meanwhile, Polaris should allow pluggable TMS options so users can choose the one that fits their needs. This document outlines how Polaris supports Iceberg table maintenance—defining its role and clarifying what it should handle and what it should leave to TMS.

Please describe.

As Iceberg users sometimes find different Iceberg-catalog sources of truth being created organically over time, it can be difficult to consolidate or centralize workloads onto a new target architecture or onboard new catalog implementations like Polaris to unlock its RBAC features without disrupting ongoing workloads.

Being able to have one Catalog instance serve as a combined ""pane of glass"" serving the contents of a legacy Catalog alongside new datasets enables an incremental migration or even simply enabling different workloads to leverage different catalog features without a stop-the-world migration.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Read-through federation of Catalog entities (e.g. Namespaces, Tables, Views) would allow a Polaris instance to link in an existing remote Catalog as a source-of-truth while exposing a Polaris entry-point along with Polaris RBAC features without performing a disruptive migration of Catalog contents.

Ideally, this federation would require minimal setup of the initial catalog connection while still benefiting from all the fine-grained access control features expected from normal Polaris catalogs; it should intelligently pass through API operations but also allow defining privilege grants on entities without requiring prior setup/syncing of those entities into the Polaris federation layer.

- [X] This is NOT a possible security vulnerability

### Describe the bug

So this _is_ a bit of a security vulnerability, but it's already public, and we don't have any official release yet, so 🤷‍♂️ 

It is possible for a malicious actor to cause Polaris to OOM by flooding the server with requests having random realm IDs.

This is possible because a) the default `RealmContextResolver` does not validate that the realm exists and b) many components maintain an unbounded cache of objects keyed by realm ID, e.g.:

* `RealmScopeContext`
* `RealmEntityManagerFactory`
* `RealmTokenBucketRateLimiter`
* `LocalPolarisMetaStoreManagerFactory`

I suggest the following mitigation measures:

* The default `RealmContextResolver` MUST validate the realm IDs – which means that we need to persist realms in the database or somewhere else (maybe in configuration?)
* Any components caching by realm ID should use a bounded cache with proper eviction policies.

1 `RealmTokenBucketRateLimiter`, because this filter kicks in _before_ the authenticating filter, thus executing itself for any request, even unauthenticated. Since it holds a map of token buckets per realm, this map can grow uncontrollably.
2. The tokens endpoint, because this resource is not protected by the authenticating filter and is invoked for every request, even unauthenticated, thus potentially growing the internal maps in `LocalPolarisMetaStoreManagerFactory`.

On the bright side, I _think_ that the internal maps would not grow uncontrollably in a ""real-life"" scenario with EclipseLink and a real database, because the realm initialization would fail on an unknown realm:

https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/aee3a027b3e3d4e1f4365faea3e9bcff9df849df/extension/persistence/eclipselink/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/extension/persistence/impl/eclipselink/PolarisEclipseLinkMetaStoreSessionImpl.java#L181

And that initialization would be triggered by the `DefaultCallContextResolver` that is invoked in the `PolarisApplication.ContextResolverFilter`, which is the very first filter to execute. So I believe that un unknown realm would throw an exception here:

https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/b8446866b55e79c35c6505681c871e22f8a86634/dropwizard/service/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/dropwizard/PolarisApplication.java#L510

That said, it still feels a bit fragile to attempt to create a meta store session for any realm, even unknown, even if from an unauthenticated request, only to see the attempt fail.

(Also, EclipseLink with the default `jdbc:h2:file` datasource is likely to create meta store sessions for any realm without any form of verification.)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6Yw4kw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* shadowJar based binary distribution works
* the ""non Uber jar"" binary distribution doesn't work because the classpath is not correct in `bin/polaris-service`: the `CLASSPATH` should contain `$APP/lib/*` (not the single Polaris service jar which is only valid for shadow jar).

Generally speaking, I don't see the reason about having two binary distributions (the shadowJar one and the ""regular"" one).

I think, the issue rather goes away once we have #469 replacing dropwizard - and/or do not rely on Gradle's ""distribution"" functionality but just package our own zip/tgz with a start-script (it's really not rocket science - likely easier than ""messing"" with the specifics of `distribution`/shadow-plugin).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6Xwqtw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Please describe.

Currently , Polaris doesn't support creating namespaces which do not exists recursively . for  spark.sql('create namespace n1.n2.n3') to work , n1 and n2 should already be there in place , or else the SQL would fail. 

To bring in compatibility with other catalog's SQL, would it make sense to support creating nested namespaces recursively? Or is there any reason behind not doing this?

### Describe the solution you'd like

allow users to create nested namespaces with a single SQL command,

### Describe alternatives you've considered

The only alternative we have is constructing multiple SQL queries which is difficult compared to what other catalog offers.

Basically, the behavior you want here is to create the parent namespace if it doesn't exist, then create the sub namespace. If Polaris allows this behavior, it actually breaks the assumption that one REST API call only creates one namespace.

GCP supports [service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-impersonation), so that given credentials for a service account, it's possible to impersonate a different service account, given that the first is granted privileges to do so. The `GcpStorageConfigurationInfo` catalog configuration [here](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/main/polaris-core/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/core/storage/gcp/GcpStorageConfigurationInfo.java#L39-L40) actually has a `gcpServiceAccount` field that we never use when vending GCS storage credentials. We can use the code in https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/create-short-lived-credentials-direct#create-access to assume the target service account, then generate a short-lived token that has the target service account's privileges subscoped to the table location during the credential vending process.

My understanding is that generally the `properties` fields are all defined in Polaris entities simply for consistency to mirror the Iceberg REST entities defined in the core Iceberg REST spec. So the question would be whether we want the entity model to diverge from Iceberg.

All the `internalProperties` contained within the Polaris persistence layer are precisely funneled through Java wrappers like `CatalogEntity`, `PrincipalEntity`, etc., precisely to enforce typed attributes.

Is this suggestion in this issue to simply get rid of `properties`? As far as I recall there's only one case where there's a member of `properties` that is partially implicit, which I agree leads to some confusing parsing logic -- the `default-base-location` in `Catalog` is portrayed as a required string key in `properties`, whereas the look-and-feel of all other attributes would've made it fit better alongside e.g. `type` and `storageConfigInfo` as top-level attributes in the REST API model (and as a consequence, reside in `internalProperties` and be unpacked through `CatalogEntity` instead of residing in the public `properties` map).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6bNKxu/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

`polaris-management-service.yml` uses a simple `entityVersion` approach to validate whether some update request, which includes the _full_ representation of the entity to be updated, can be performed or not.

The approach to be able to update a whole entity should be replaced with specific update operations per entity type. This is much easier to validate in service implementations and easier to understand from a client's point of view.

Polaris currently uses Dropwizard and relies on Jackson for configuration, but also ties initialization/setup/business logic into configuration objects.

For example in `PolarisApplicationConfig` there are:
```java
  @JsonProperty(""realmContextResolver"")
  @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = ""type"")
  public void setRealmContextResolver(RealmContextResolver realmContextResolver) {
    this.realmContextResolver = realmContextResolver;
  }

  @JsonProperty(""defaultRealm"")
  public void setDefaultRealm(String defaultRealm) {
    this.defaultRealm = defaultRealm;
    realmContextResolver.setDefaultRealm(defaultRealm);
  }
```

These code constructs are racy/error-prone, because literally nothing guarantees that `realmContextResolver` is set to `!= null` when `setDefaultRealm()` is invoked.

Basically all object types in Polaris have mutable attributes, either directly (via setters) or indirectly (via collections). This is known to be prone to programming issues. All value types should really be immutable types - none of the elements of a value type should be mutable. Libraries like [immutable](https://immutables.github.io/) are built to support this.

[immutable](https://immutables.github.io/) is superior to both Java records and Lombok. While the direct attributes of Java records are not changeable, the objects (collections!) referenced from Java records are not enforced to be immutable. Lombok provides similar functionality than immutables, but adds bytecode (and functions/methods) that is not present in the source code, which makes for example debugging harder.

> Customers need the ability to configure proxy settings when connecting to Snowflake Open Catalog via the Spark Connector in Java. This is especially critical for organizations where network access to SaaS services (like Snowflake Open Catalog) is restricted and must go through a corporate proxy.
> 
> Currently, proxy configuration is supported for connecting to Snowflake accounts via the Snowflake Spark Connector, as documented here:
> [Proxy Options for Snowflake Spark Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/spark-connector-use#proxy-options).
> 
> However, similar proxy configuration options are not available when connecting to Snowflake Open Catalog. Attempts to use standard Spark configurations like spark.driver.extraJavaOptions to set proxy details have not been successful.

- Polaris will then **serialize** the content of the `metadata.json` into a **LoadTableResponse** to return to the client.

### **Write Path**  
When the table is updated, Polaris will:  
1. Gather the changes and generate a new `metadata.json`.  
2. Use the S3 table API [`update-table-metadata-location`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3tables/update-table-metadata-location.html) to commit the new metadata.  

### **AuthZ/AuthN**
We need to ensure that the AWS role used for creating the Polaris catalog has the read and write privileges of the s3 table.

That's right. This integration won't change the source of truth(s3 table in this case), and other tools or pipelines against the source catalog should still work as is.

> should it be a concern if ""update-table-metadata-location"" fail and cause table metadata out of the sync, which could mislead S3 Tables to clean up missing metadata data (and its data files) as orphan files?

Polaris client will get the failure message in that case, then it can retry or just fail itself. The table is still consistent. But the failure may leave orphan files, which is fine as the other clients also leave orphan files in case of failure.

HMS will have to invoke the s3 api `update-table-metadata-location` to commit, otherwise there would be consistent issue.

When trying to update the AWS roleArn for an existed catalog, it will throw 400 error.

### To Reproduce

Create a new dummy catalog:
```
curl -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer principal:root;realm:default-realm"" ""http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/catalogs"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
         ""catalog"": {
           ""name"": ""polaris"",
           ""type"": ""INTERNAL"",
           ""readOnly"": false,
           ""properties"": {
             ""default-base-location"": ""s3://tmp/polaris/""
           },
           ""storageConfigInfo"": {
             ""roleArn"": ""arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role-name-with-path"",
             ""storageType"": ""S3"",
             ""allowedLocations"": [
               ""s3://tmp/polaris/""
             ]
           }
         }
       }'
```

Ensure catalog is created:
```
curl -X GET -H ""Authorization: Bearer principal:root;realm:default-realm"" ""http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/catalogs""
```

Here is the sample output:
```
{
  ""catalogs"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""INTERNAL"",
      ""name"": ""polaris"",
      ""properties"": {
        ""default-base-location"": ""s3://tmp/polaris/""
      },
      ""createTimestamp"": 1734571966158,
      ""lastUpdateTimestamp"": 1734571966158,
      ""entityVersion"": 1,
      ""storageConfigInfo"": {
        ""storageType"": ""S3"",
        ""roleArn"": ""arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role-name-with-path"",
        ""externalId"": null,
        ""userArn"": null,
        ""region"": null,
        ""allowedLocations"": [
          ""s3://tmp/polaris/""
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then tried to update `roleArn` for this catalog:
```
curl -X PUT -H ""Authorization: Bearer principal:root;realm:default-realm"" ""http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/catalogs/polaris"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{
           ""currentEntityVersion"": 1,
           ""properties"": {
             ""default-base-location"": ""s3://tmp/polaris/""
           },
           ""storageConfigInfo"": {
             ""roleArn"": ""arn:aws:iam::123456789013:role/role-name-with-path"",
             ""storageType"": ""S3"",
             ""allowedLocations"": [
               ""s3://tmp/polaris/""
             ]
           }
       }'
```


### Actual Behavior

Getting following error message with status code 400:
```
{
  ""error"": {
    ""message"": ""Cannot modify Role ARN in storage config from AwsStorageConfigurationInfo{storageType=S3, storageType=S3, roleARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role-name-with-path, userARN=null, externalId=null, allowedLocation=[s3://tmp/polaris/], region=null} to AwsStorageConfigurationInfo{storageType=S3, storageType=S3, roleARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789013:role/role-name-with-path, userARN=null, externalId=null, allowedLocation=[s3://tmp/polaris/], region=null}"",
    ""type"": ""BadRequestException"",
    ""code"": 400
  }
}
```

### Expected Behavior

Getting 200 instead. 

### Additional context

Here is the code for this (https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/main/service/common/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/admin/PolarisAdminService.java):
```
      if (!currentAwsConfig.getRoleARN().equals(newAwsConfig.getRoleARN())
          || !newAwsConfig.getRoleARN().equals(currentAwsConfig.getRoleARN())) {
        throw new BadRequestException(
            ""Cannot modify Role ARN in storage config from %s to %s"",
            currentStorageConfig, newStorageConfig);
      }
```

I am not sure why this is not allowed as change of roleARN seems to be common (e.g. renamed of existed AWS role name)

Establishing a predictable release cadence will help us:
- Deliver key roadmap features in a timely and structured manner.
- Provide clarity and transparency for contributors and users about what to expect in upcoming versions.
- Align with related projects, such as Apache Iceberg, to ensure compatibility and ease of integration.

## Current Status and Proposal
We are currently preparing for the **0.9.0** release, which is scheduled to ship by **January 2025**. To maintain momentum and adapt to the fast-paced development in the REST catalog space, I propose that we adopt a **three-month release cycle**. This cadence will allow us to stay agile while ensuring regular updates.

Additionally, this schedule aligns with Iceberg’s release cycle, which could be beneficial if any Iceberg Spec changes require updates or synchronization with Polaris. While syncing releases with Iceberg isn’t mandatory, aligning them could help streamline cross-project compatibility.

## Suggested Release Plan
Using this cadence as a baseline:
- 0.9.0: January 2025
- 1.0.0: April 2025
- 1.1.0: July 2025
- 1.2.0: October 2025 ...and so on.

It’s worth noting that actual **release dates may shift by about one month**, depending on development progress or unforeseen circumstances. We could adjust timelines as needed.

I’ve created related **milestones**(https://github.com/apache/polaris/milestones) in the project to reflect these timelines. I encourage everyone to review them and tag any relevant issues or pull requests with the appropriate versions.

## Roadmap Integration
With these milestones in place, the roadmap will naturally take shape, driven by the features and fixes tagged in each release. Moving forward, we can:
- File new feature requests or bug fixes with milestone tags.
- Use these milestones as a guiding framework for project planning and prioritization.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/584/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Polaris has become a cornerstone for managing structured data across diverse processing engines, ensuring high performance and reliability. To further enhance its capabilities, we propose extending Polaris to support unstructured data. This will enable it to handle a broader range of data types efficiently, meeting the growing demands of AI/ML and other data-intensive applications.

In this case, two things happened:
- I was allowed unauthenticated call (check polaris-server below) w/o getting 401 right away
- I am able to see what backend type is configured and I can check what databases are deployed there

### To Reproduce

(in describe section)

### Actual Behavior

HTTP call is allowed and stack trace information reveals certain details about metastore backend

### Expected Behavior

HTTP 401 - w/o any details, details logged on DEBUG level if configured for the server via values.yaml

### Additional context

Polairs build commit: https://github.com/apache/polaris/commit/0f5850c8f6dd01932f758d331dce13d2bc5d0a1c
EclipseLink with PSQL

If database is **bootstrapped**, 401 is returned correctly

Well, the test services are still there, so there is a chance someone could put Polaris into production with test-grade authentication.  But contrary to Dropwizard, the test services are not the default ones, so the user must enable them explicitly.

We should also take UX into account: if someone runs `docker run apache/polaris` and the container fails to start because there is no private key configured or whatever, that's a bad UX. But that's what happens now with Quarkus.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6ZeHQo/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The `polaris-server.yml` in the root folder is made for testing purposes, and is by far not usable in production-ish setups. This is not nice and causes a lot of confusion and try-and-error round-trips - most of those errors aren't immediately visible to end users and only discoverable using an attached debugger.

Summary of the issues:
* The `default-realm` cannot be bootstrapped - something like `export POLARIS_BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT-REALM_ROOT_CLIENT_ID=default_root_client`, as documented, does not work in e.g. `bash` - also: nothing says that the realm and principal name must be upper case in the env var names.
* `oauth2` is configured to `test` - that doesn't make sense for prod use cases
* `authenticator` same as for `oauth2`
* `tokenBroker` is not configured and not mentioned at all in the config file
* `defaultRealm` and `defaultRealms` options are at least confusing

The code design makes it extremely hard for users, even engineers, to figure out that and even harder why things do not work.

I propose to use this issue to come up with a better config mechanism via #469 and follow-ups.

The default configuration should at least work.

Eventually I think we can even clean a lot of this up. That is, remove the logging and a lot of the code. We just needed this to make sure we didn't break any existing deployments using the old (legacy) metastore implementation.

When trying to rotate a principal's credentials via the root user, an HTTP error with code 403 is returned:
```
{""error"":{""message"":""Principal 'root' with activated PrincipalRoles '[]' and activated grants via '[service_admin]' is not authorized for op ROTATE_CREDENTIALS"",""type"":""ForbiddenException"",""code"":403}}
```

### To Reproduce

1. Deploy locally via `docker compose up --build`
2. Note down the root principal credentials and store them in a shell variable, e.g.
    ```shell
    CLIENT_ID=f69f1990657205d9
    CLIENT_SECRET=e89026b4e87d60b7bd6ea75adb16e6f8
    ```
3. Get an access token for the root principal
    ```shell
    TOKEN=""$(curl --request POST ""http://localhost:8181/api/catalog/v1/oauth/tokens?grant_type=client_credentials&scope=PRINCIPAL_ROLE%3AALL&client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&client_secret=${CLIENT_SECRET}"" \
    --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    | jq -r .access_token)""
    ```
4. Create a new principal
    ```shell
    curl --request POST http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/principals \
    --header ""Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"" \
    --header ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
    -d '{""name"": ""test""}')""
    ```
5. Try to rotate the credentials of the new principal using the same token as it was created with
    ```shell
    curl --request POST http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/principals/test/rotate \
    --header ""Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN""
    ```


### Actual Behavior

The service returns a 403 response
```
{""error"":{""message"":""Principal 'root' with activated PrincipalRoles '[]' and activated grants via '[service_admin]' is not authorized for op ROTATE_CREDENTIALS"",""type"":""ForbiddenException"",""code"":403}}

The principal credentials should successfully be rotated

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/625,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/625,polaris,2775327461,625,Quick start guide missing configuration,dicarcab,110469300,Diego Cardenas,,CLOSED,2025-01-08T12:54:09Z,2025-01-14T12:00:46Z,"### Describe the bug

Hello, I've trying to test Polaris locally using the official Docker Image and a local gradle build, but have and issue while writing data to a catalog using S3. 

I followed the Quick start guide and everything works fine until I tried to insert data to the table but I kept getting this answer 
`Server error: S3Exception: The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint. (Service: S3, Status Code: 301,)` is there any configuration that must be specified to the docker image to be able to write data to the desired location ? 

I set up the aws access and secret key and my bucket is in the same region that is used in the docker compose image. Is there missing steps in the official documentation ?

### To Reproduce
1. set aws AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEYas env variables, AWS_REGION is set as us-west-2 inside docker file as the S3 bucket to be used.
2. Follow the quick start guide create roles and catalog using the docker compose file inside polaris repo
3. start local spark 3.5
4. use catalog and create namespaces and table using spark sql
5. using spark sql spark.sql(""INSERT INTO quickstart_table VALUES (1, 'some data')"") command

### Actual Behavior

error returned by the rest api `Server error: S3Exception: The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint. (Service: S3, Status Code: 301,)` is there any configuration that must be specified to the docker image to be able to write data to the desired location ? 

### Expected Behavior

Data should be written in the table

### Additional context

_No response_

### System information

Here is how to reproduce this:

Having the same issue:
```
scala> spark.sql(""INSERT INTO quickstart_table VALUES (1, 'some data')"")
...
software.amazon.awssdk.core.exception.SdkClientException: Unable to load region from any of the providers in the chain software.amazon.awssdk.regions.providers.DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain@1315b5e8: [software.amazon.awssdk.regions.providers.SystemSettingsRegionProvider@350a6bf2: Unable to load region from system settings. Region must be specified either via environment variable (AWS_REGION) or  system property (aws.region)., software.amazon.awssdk.regions.providers.AwsProfileRegionProvider@54b391ae: No region provided in profile: default, software.amazon.awssdk.regions.providers.InstanceProfileRegionProvider@2be11aa0: Unable to contact EC2 metadata service.]
```

One way to fix this is set region on the client side (spark) via global variable but this can be problematic when distributed compute kicked in as worker nodes won't have this set:
```
➜  spark-3.5.4-bin-hadoop3 export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
...
scala> spark.sql(""INSERT INTO quickstart_table VALUES (1, 'some data')"")
SLF4J: Failed to load class ""org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
res7: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []

scala> spark.sql(""select * from quickstart_table limit 10"").show()
+---+---------+
| id|     data|
+---+---------+
|  1|some data|
+---+---------+
```

Thus, it is better to set via catalog property such as following:
```
--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.client.region=us-west-2
```

Here is the PR for the above change: https://github.com/apache/polaris/pull/712

Also, this can be avoid is region is set on the catalog level (via storageConfigInfo.region...more details in https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/polaris-management-service/#operation/listCatalogs)

- My iceberg client runs in the us-west-1, 
- The target bucket is located on the us-west-1
- The Snowflake open catalog is located on us-west-2

When I use the Iceberg client to create an Iceberg table, it throws the following exception

Do I need to deploy the Snowflake open catalog in the same region as the target bucket?

Polaris, as a server, should be able run run recent Java versions for various reasons (GC improvements, heap usage improvements, OS integration improvements, etc etc etc).

""Client"" libraries (think: Iceberg, Spark, Hadoop) however are known to cause problems with ""newest"" Java versions and/or recent library versions for various reasons.

Polaris relies on Hadoop and Spark for its tests and we are therefore limited to only run on Java versions that those libraries support / work with. It usually takes a lot of time until all these libraries are all compatible with ""newer"" Java versions - often lagging behind a few Java versions.

## Goals

1. Tests should not rely on Hadoop or Spark, at best not even Iceberg, but only on Polaris code
2. If tests (think: integration tests) really need Hadoop and/or Spark, those should run separately using a ""compatible"" Java version to allow Polaris to leverage modern Java versions.

## Polaris tests using Hadoop fail with Java 23

Background: The whole Java `SecurityManager` stuff was deprecated in Java 17 via [JEP 411](https://openjdk.org/jeps/411) (April 2021). Alternatives (`Subject.getSubject()` --> `Subject.current()`) have been [introduced with Java 18](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8267108).

[JEP 486](https://openjdk.org/jeps/486) is about to _permanently_ disable the security manager, even the workaround to set `java.security.manager=allow` will not work beginning with Java 24 (the JVM won't start).

There's [HADOOP-19212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-19212) (opened June 2024) with sadly rather [stale PR](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/7081).

Time zone can be confusing and influence date/time based calculations.
Polaris uses [`Clock.system(ZoneId.systemDefault())`](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/1868bbd7fac369bea9cd47cd85e478841e29c8c3/polaris-core/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/core/PolarisCallContext.java#L58), which can cause all kinds of time/date/zone related issues.

Please describe.

This test imports a bunch of `org.apache.spark.*` classes and because of that, causes trouble with dependencies:

```kotlin
  // required for PolarisSparkIntegrationTest
  testImplementation(enforcedPlatform(libs.scala212.lang.library))
  testImplementation(enforcedPlatform(libs.scala212.lang.reflect))
  testImplementation(libs.javax.servlet.api)
  testImplementation(libs.antlr4.runtime)
```

The above dependences, and in particular Antlr, prevents us from using `enforcedPlatform` on Quarkus BOM.

We need to isolate this test in its own configuration and/or module.

Similar to #739, we should use `enforcedPlatform` consistently in all modules. But that is currently blocked by #749 and we can't do it for `polaris-quarkus-service`.

### To Reproduce

_No response_

### Actual Behavior

When attempting to run `quarkusRun` from `polaris-quarkus-service` without `enforcedPlatform`, we get mixed versions of some artifacts like the OpenTelemetry ones.

The typical error message is:

Create New Directory:
Create client/python/ to house the Python client.

Move Files:
Move all files from regtests/client/ to client/python/.

bash
Copy
Edit
mv regtests/client/* client/python/
Update References:
Update imports (regtests.client → client.python) across the codebase and documentation.

Verify Tests:
Update test configurations if necessary and run all tests to confirm functionality.

Check Build Scripts:
Update paths in build scripts, CI/CD workflows, or Dockerfiles.

Optional Symlink:
Add a symlink (ln -s client/python regtests/client) for backward compatibility, if required.

Communicate Change:
Update team, release notes, and documentation about the new directory structure.

Code Review:
Submit a pull request for review, merge, and deploy after approval.

This ensures the Python client is better organized without breaking functionality.

The only implementation of `PolarisDiagnostics` (`PolarisDefaultDiagServiceImpl`) has various issues:

* All functions that take `extraInfoFormat` and `extraInfoArgs` seem to accept a SLF4J-style formatting using `{}`, but the actual formatting relies on Guava's `Preconditions`, which only accepts `%s`. The formatted messages then read awkward: `something_went_wrong: id={} fileName={} [""a"", java.lang.Object@deadbeef]` due to the implementation
* The generated exception messages contain rather cryptic information (e.g. `unexpected_not_found_entity`) instead of a description that users can act on.
* Some functions say: ""Create a fatal incident if expression is false"" - but all the implementation does is calling `Preconditions.checkState()`
* Nit-ish maybe: some functions unnecessarily have a `throw new RuntimeException` after a `Preconditions.checkState(false, ...`

The current implementation is not really useful and emits no information/instructions that a user could act on (other than raising questions on a chat or open a GH issue).

These are some options:
1. replace all usages of `PolarisDiagnostics` with direct use of `Preconditions` / `Objects.requireNonNull` and eventually remove `PolarisDiagnostics` and its implementation
2. refactor `PolarisDiagnostics` and implement a proper mapping of error-codes to user consumable and act-able messages

Generally speaking (IMHO), the use of `PolarisDiagnostics` adds a lot of boilerplate code that makes it harder than necessary to read the code.

The current way of how Polaris uses databases for persistence is to encode the realm-ID in the JDBC connection URL - aka: one isolated database per realm.

On the other side, `org.apache.polaris.extension.persistence.impl.eclipselink.PolarisSequenceUtil` is global and static and it's `initialize()` function does not account the fact that there can be multiple realms.

`PolarisEclipseLinkMetaStoreSessionImpl` uses a `ThreadLocal` containing a `EntityManager`. It is set and removed in all these `runInTransaction` functions.

Calling functions like `lookupEntity` directly on `PolarisMetaStoreSession` will result in a `NullPointerException`.
`PolarisMetaStoreSession` does not require calling `lookupEntity` via a `runInTransaction`, but instead [defines here](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/88994f495a844f420187b9404511504601081a1a/polaris-core/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/core/persistence/PolarisMetaStoreSession.java#L45-L46): `The goal is to make it really easy to back this using databases like Postgres or simpler KV store.` - this is not the case, because it is implicitly required to use `runInTransaction` - but ""simpler"" KV stores do _*not*_ have transactions as in relational databases.

Despite that `PolarisMetaStoreSession` [clearly says](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/88994f495a844f420187b9404511504601081a1a/polaris-core/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/core/persistence/PolarisMetaStoreSession.java#L45-L46) that `it [is] really easy to back this using [...] simpler KV store.` the whole code architecture of everything around persistence in Polaris requires nothing less than (relational) transactions and strong consistency across multiple rows in multiple tables.

For example `org.apache.polaris.core.persistence.PolarisMetaStoreManagerImpl#writeEntity`:
```java
  private void writeEntity(
      @Nonnull PolarisMetaStoreSession ms,
      @Nonnull PolarisBaseEntity entity,
      boolean writeToActive) {
    ms.writeToEntities(entity);
    ms.writeToEntitiesChangeTracking(entity);

    if (writeToActive) {
      ms.writeToEntitiesActive(entity);
    }
  }
```
works against 2-3 different _rows_ in 2-3 different _tables_, requiring that all or none of the changes succeed - this is multiplied by the number of entities being written. On top it requires that entities being read before (existing and non-existing) did not change when the tx gets committed.

The ""pattern"" of having these different tables leaks into a lot of places. It effectively makes it rather impossible to use anything else than a relational database w/ isolation level `SERIALIZABLE`.

In particular:

1. Most of the independent one-shot reads happen to be structured as `runInReadTransaction` but aren't actually depending on transaction semantics
2. The `writeToEntities`, `writeToEntitiesChangeTracking`, `writeToEntitiesActive` triplet is actually more for serving the role of secondary indexes than truly being separate tables. There are caveats depending on how we approach vestigial plans for UNDROP functionality, but it's worth discussing whether these make sense to push down to the `MetaStoreSession` layer and even refactoring the EclipseLink one to better portray these as serving efficient queries on a single table
3. A few operations actually do uniquely require various flavors of transactions across multiple rows or tables; we should enumerate these separately from the majority of ""core"" actions. Of particular interest off the top of my head:
    a. CreateCatalog relationship to a ""storage integration"" object and bootstrapped CatalogRoles

I'm not sure whether Polaris persistence can ensure that no two entities (think: Iceberg tables & views) with the same name can ever exist.

The reason I'm bringing this up is the disconnect of the name resolution vs technical ID resolution.

It feels possible that two concurrent requests to e.g. create a new table pass the ""that name does not yet exist"" check and then both write new entities with the same name.

The name checks are only _programmatic_ checks against previous read operations - but there is nothing that technically prevents having duplicate names.

`PolarisEntityCore` type hierarchy is used to represent the persisted (or about to be persisted) state. Especially the already persisted state should be considered immutable. Instances of `PolarisEntityCore` are also cached via `org.apache.polaris.core.persistence.cache.EntityCacheEntry#entity`.

`PolarisEntityCore` + `PolarisBaseEntity` type hierarchy exposes _public_ setters for effectively all properties. This makes it very easy to (accidentally?) _modify_ entity instances that are cached or in any other way shared. Although the types have some ""copy constructors"", the risk of modifying attributes is still there. Even if a legit change to a property of a shared object would not be correct, given the Java memory model guarantees.

Polaris uses some asynchronously executed tasks to run operations for table and manifest file cleanup. Those tasks are potentially executed in a separate thread in the same JVM. There is however no guarantee that those tasks will eventually run for multiple reasons:

* Tasks (e.g. via `org.apache.polaris.service.catalog.BasePolarisCatalog#dropTable`) are triggered _after_ the fact.
* Although tasks are persisted, there is no mechanism to pick up tasks that did not start or did not finish (""long lasting"" failures, JVM terminates).

Overall this means that for example a ""drop table with purge"" returns a successful result to the user, the actual purge may never ever happen.

The persistence model (as in `org.apache.polaris.core.entity`) is built around assumptions for a particular implementation. It does not just define different entity types (think: catalog, namespace, table, etc) but also implementation details about cache and data consistency details. These details leak though the whole code base that has to deal with any kind of entity. This makes it extremely difficult to use another persistence backend than the one this persistence model was built for, like the ""simpler KV store"" mentioned in `PolarisMetaStoreSession`.

Please describe.

Polaris does requires secrets like storage credentials and access credentials for remote systems.

Those secrets can currently only be configured statically via the configuration or persisted, latter is rather static as well. Also, secrets are currently persisted in various very different ways / property keys.

It would be much better to have a consistent way to access secrets and (let them) manage those in a secure way. At best, secrets would not even be stored in Polaris, but managed by trusted secrets managers.

All secrets should be considered ""ephemeral"" - meaning: secrets can be rotated at any time without even noticing Polaris. Already assuming in the design that secrets can be rotated at any without being noticed makes it easier for users and system integrators.

As pointed out on the [mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread/obvrrh0w36f87rwljptzwonpt89qkcm1), the current persistence implementation in Polaris, even if run with the required isolation level, yields errors like `ERROR: could not
serialize access due to read/write dependencies among transactions`. The underlying test case, which runs concurrent modifications to _different_ Iceberg tables (non-conflicting changes) and did not ""overload"" Polaris, should really _never_ yield such errors to users.

This issue _could_ be a consequence of #775, assuming that the behavior of one persistence backend can be ported 1:1 to another one.

The current Polaris management spec has a few shortcomings:

* It exposes and requires persistence internals (#556) like entityVersion, created/modified timestamps
* It exposes the rather internal persistence model via a public API
* None of the list requests/responses are use paging
* It uses the generic property bags, which requires detailed knowledge of the properties on each client (#555)
* Create/update/delete requests rely on persistence internals and changes are improperly validated on the server side

I propose a complete overhaul of that API, as a v2 and eventually remove v1 before 1.0:

* Enable pagination of list requests using opaque paging-tokens
* Have a data model built on actual, distinct properties instead of generic property bags. This helps users to reason about individual properties and also helps to not accidentally exposing sensitive information.
* Have specific update requests (or update request payloads) for each kind of change instead of sending the whole entity and update everything. This is much easier to reason about from the client side and also much easier to verify & validate on the server side.

All entities of the persistence model have `asXyz()` functions to return a type from the management OpenAPI spec. While this is currently convenient, it introduces a cyclic dependency, which should generally be avoided:

* entities depend on management-API

When bootstrapping a realm, either with the env var `POLARIS_BOOTSTRAP_CREDENTIALS` or using the admin tool, the provided secrets get rotated. 

Because previous secrets are still valid, this works, but I would argue that that's a bad user experience: the user said they want secret A, and they get secret B, and it's B that gets printed to stdout (for in-memory metastores).

What is the reason for doing this rotation?

* If the secrets were randomly generated, rotating is meaningless
* If the secrets were provided by the user, rotating effectively overrides their instructions.

Currently the `./polaris` CLI tool requires the user to provide a client ID/secret pair.

However, most of Polaris APIs actually require a Bearer token.

With on-going discussions about supporting external IdP, supporting bearer tokens become more appropriate in CLI too.

Please describe.

Currently Polaris has a number of filters, some of them being ""regular"" JAX-RS filters, some others being Vert.x route filters:

| Filter | Type | Priority |
| ------|-----| --------|
| `QuarkusLoggingMDCFilter` | Vert.x | `RouteFilter.DEFAULT_PRIORITY + 100` (110) |
| `QuarkusTracingFilter` | Vert.x | `QuarkusLoggingMDCFilter.PRIORITY - 1` (109) |
| `PolarisPrincipalAuthenticatorFilter` | JAX-RS | `Piorities.AUTHENTICATION ` (1000) |
| `PolarisPrincipalRolesProviderFilter`  | JAX-RS | `Piorities.AUTHENTICATION  + 1` (1001) |
| `RateLimiterFilter` | JAX-RS | `Piorities.USER ` (5000) |

The above has a number of issues:

First off, from my experience, Vert.x filters always execute first, regardless of priorities (also, Vert.x priorities are inverted compared to JAX-RS ones). This induces a wrong order of execution:

1. `QuarkusLoggingMDCFilter`
2. `QuarkusTracingFilter`
3. `PolarisPrincipalAuthenticatorFilter`
4. `PolarisPrincipalRolesProviderFilter`
5. `RateLimiterFilter`

Secondly, we ideally need a filter to verify realm IDs. For two reasons:

1. The default realm ID resolver throws an exception if the realm is unknown. That's fine, but the error at that stage, since the resolver is a CDI bean, is translated into HTTP 500. If we want to return something more meaningful, like HTTP 403, we'd need to do that in a filter.  Related to this: #805.
2. Also, `QuarkusLoggingMDCFilter` and `QuarkusTracingFilter` both need the realm ID. So they should execute after the realm ID filter.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I think we need to reorder the filters as below:

1. `RealmIdFilter`(to be created)
2. `QuarkusLoggingMDCFilter`
3. `QuarkusTracingFilter`
4. `PolarisPrincipalAuthenticatorFilter`
5. `PolarisPrincipalRolesProviderFilter`
6. `RateLimiterFilter`

Or maybe as below if we want the authenticator to kick in first:

1. `PolarisPrincipalAuthenticatorFilter`
2. `RealmIdFilter`(to be created)
3. `PolarisPrincipalRolesProviderFilter`
4. `QuarkusLoggingMDCFilter`
5. `QuarkusTracingFilter`
6. `RateLimiterFilter`

We may need to convert the Vert.x filters into JAX-RS ones, or the other way around.

> The RealmIdFilter or RealmContextResolver must be executed prior to authentication - a caller can only be authenticated within a realm.

Thanks for confirming, that was my conclusion as well.

For the record, it was already being resolved prior to authentication, but with one annoying difference: the realm was being resolved as part of CDI resolution, see here:

https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/df538b3928d259e9ec0339d05b12ef6c73b55a15/quarkus/service/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/quarkus/config/QuarkusProducers.java#L101-L110

While this works well in the happy case (the realm can be resolved), it throws HTTP 500 in the unhappy case of wrong realm.

Hence the changes in #848 : realm resolution is moved to a pre-auth filter:

https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/9c454942cc12de03ed820dc324c90b7ff4e38341/service/common/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/context/RealmIdFilter.java#L48-L56

The filter resolves the realm, then sets it as a request property. Then CDI now simply reads the realm ID from the request property and produces the request-scoped bean that will be injected everywhere:

https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/9c454942cc12de03ed820dc324c90b7ff4e38341/quarkus/service/src/main/java/org/apache/polaris/service/quarkus/config/QuarkusProducers.java#L101-L105

We already have ways to collect and verify licenses for the Java ecosystem.

It would help a lot to also have license verification for the Python ecosystem, to ensure that dependencies are used in an ASF-compliant way.

This is rather not just an ""enhancement"" or ""improvement"" but a necessity, because I suspect that not many people will manually inspect all Python direct and indirect dependencies after every dependency change or at least before every release.

License violations cause serious trouble.

I'm trying to register a table from an old catalog into Polaris, but when I set up the Polaris catalog with the needed allowed-locations I get permission errors saying can't access the pathway of the old catalog.



### To Reproduce

I created a new Polaris Catalog (polaris_catalog) and set its default location to be `gs://newCatalog` and also set allowed-locations to be `gs://oldCatalog`. When I go to get the info for this catalog I can see both of those pathways showing up in allowedLocations section.

I then try and run
```
CALL polaris_catalog.system.register_table(
          table => 'new_namespace.migrated_table',
          metadata_file => 'gs://oldCatalog/old_namespace/table/metadata/00001-763bca99-363b-4d94-a6c7-221c8c691a8a.metadata.json'
        )
```



### Actual Behavior

It throws an error saying `org.apache.iceberg.exceptions.ForbiddenException: Forbidden: Invalid locations '[gs://oldCatalog/old_namespace/table]' for identifier 'new_namespace.migrated_table': gs://oldCatalog/old_namespace/table is not in the list of allowed locations: [gs://newCatalog/new_namespace]`

I recalled this was working before (but I don't recalled if I did this one on SaaS one or OSS one). Then to get the local OSS one working, you will need to make the changes to the following config:
```
featureConfiguration:
...
  ALLOW_UNSTRUCTURED_TABLE_LOCATION: true
...
```

This is because the following code (`PolarisStorageConfigurationInfo.java`):
```
              boolean allowEscape =
                  CallContext.getCurrentContext()
                      .getPolarisCallContext()
                      .getConfigurationStore()
                      .getConfiguration(
                          CallContext.getCurrentContext().getPolarisCallContext(),
                          catalog,
                          PolarisConfiguration.ALLOW_UNSTRUCTURED_TABLE_LOCATION);
              if (!allowEscape
                  && catalog.getCatalogType() != Catalog.TypeEnum.EXTERNAL
                  && baseLocation != null) {
                LOGGER.debug(
                    ""Not allowing unstructured table location for entity: {}"",
                    entityPathReversed.get(0).getName());
                return new StorageConfigurationOverride(configInfo, List.of(baseLocation));
              } else {
                LOGGER.debug(
                    ""Allowing unstructured table location for entity: {}"",
                    entityPathReversed.get(0).getName());

                List<String> locs =
                    userSpecifiedWriteLocations(entityPathReversed.get(0).getPropertiesAsMap());
                return new StorageConfigurationOverride(
                    configInfo,
                    ImmutableList.<String>builder()
                        .addAll(configInfo.getAllowedLocations())
                        .addAll(locs)
                        .build());
```

When `ALLOW_UNSTRUCTURED_TABLE_LOCATION` is not set, it won't read additional allowed locations to begin with via this abstraction. Thus the following will keep failing (`BasePolarisCatalog.java`):
```
  private void validateLocationsForTableLike(
      TableIdentifier identifier,
      Set<String> locations,
      PolarisResolvedPathWrapper resolvedStorageEntity) {
    Optional<PolarisStorageConfigurationInfo> optStorageConfiguration =
        PolarisStorageConfigurationInfo.forEntityPath(
            callContext.getPolarisCallContext().getDiagServices(),
            resolvedStorageEntity.getRawFullPath());

    optStorageConfiguration.ifPresentOrElse(
        storageConfigInfo -> {
          Map<String, Map<PolarisStorageActions, PolarisStorageIntegration.ValidationResult>>
              validationResults =
                  InMemoryStorageIntegration.validateSubpathsOfAllowedLocations(
                      storageConfigInfo, Set.of(PolarisStorageActions.ALL), locations);
          validationResults
              .values()
              .forEach(
                  actionResult ->
                      actionResult
                          .values()
                          .forEach(
                              result -> {
                                if (!result.isSuccess()) {
                                  throw new ForbiddenException(
                                      ""Invalid locations '%s' for identifier '%s': %s"",
                                      locations, identifier, result.getMessage());
                                } else {
                                  LOGGER.debug(
                                      ""Validated locations '{}' for identifier '{}'"",
                                      locations,
                                      identifier);
                                }
                              }));
...
```

When the setting is not set, the `PolarisResolvedPathWrapper` will have the right settings but the abstraction `optStorageConfiguration` that is building on top won't have the right setting for allowed location. Thus failing the check later on.

From the code, it is not storage specific (as there is nothing forcing GCS to fail....from the above, it is tested with FILE only and I recalled I got it working with AWS S3 long time back).

When building Polaris, we often see an annoying message printed many times to the console, e.g.:

I don't think we have truly split packages in Polaris. The above is likely a false positive. This can be seen by the number of conflicting artifacts: there is always only one artifact. This probably hints at 2 or more artifacts produced by the same module, having the same name. One possible culprit would be the artifacts created by the `distribution` plugin.

Here is my long term vision:

- I think the test profile (used in automated tests) is too different from the prod profile. It is always good to make those converge as much as possible. That's why I opened #786. I think it would be good to merge that one quickly, I will do it today.
- I also think that the regression tests should strive to use the same config as in production. This is not the case today, as you noticed, which is why I think you opened this issue. I started a PR (in draft) here: #804 where the authenticator for regression tests is changed to use the production one. 
- As much as possible, I think that the `test` authenticator + token broker should only be used for prototyping, quickstart guides and demos, but not for tests.

Does that make sense?

If that's OK with you, let's proceed as follows:

- Get #786 merged
- Get #804 reviewed and merged
- Revisit the docs and fix all the places where the regression tests are not launched with the appropriate parameters.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/polaris/issues/comments/IC_kwDOMCWwoM6bsN3q/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Please describe.

The bootstrap command currently takes its input from command line arguments.

But the best for Kubernetes would be to store the bootstrap credentials in a secret, that could look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: polaris-bootstrap-creds
data:
  realm1: ""client1:secret1""
  realm2: ""client2:secret2""
```

Then the secret could be mounted and each entry would become a file named `realm1`, `realm2` etc. with contents `client1:secret1`, `client2:secret2` etc.

It would be awesome if the bootstrap command could parse the directory and create the credentials from the files.

The bootstrap and purge commands currently fail hard on common errors such as: 

- realm is already bootstrapped
- realm does not exist or is not bootstrapped

It would be a better UX if we could ignore these errors via a command line option.

Also, the logged messages do not clearly specify which realm failed. In case many realms were provided to the command, that's confusing.

I wanted to share my thoughts on the ongoing discussion in[ PR #741](https://github.com/apache/polaris/pull/741). about whether to use `Realm` or `RealmId`. 

The more I consider it, the more it seems that the name Realm is the natural choice. It is more an atomic concept, much like the concept of a `region` in AWS.

If we take a closer look at the current usage across Polaris—in documentation, error messages, and configurations—`realm` and `realmId` are already used interchangeably. In fact, in most cases, we simply use `realm` rather than `realmId`.

Here are a few examples in the Polaris repo:

Error Messages:
1. `realm: <realm> root principal credentials: <client-id>:<client-secret>`

Configurations:

1. `Polaris.realm-context.realms`
2. `jdbc:h2:file:./build/test_data/polaris/{realm}/db`

Documentation:

1. [Metastores](https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/metastores/)
2. [Configuring Polaris for Production](https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/configuring-polaris-for-production/)
3. [Admin Tool](https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/admin-tool/)

#### Proposal
Based on this consistency and the conceptual clarity it brings, I proposed two options:

- Option 1, using the name `realm` instead of `realmId` throughout Polaris and still keeping the interface (`public interface Realm`) for dependency injection purposes. The interface can be extensible in case we want to add any subconcept to the realm, which may never happen to be honest.
- Option 2, purely using a string for `realm` instead of an interface, this is simpler ultimately, but not extensible and needs more effort to refactor the current code.

Serializing `Catalog` objects to JSON appears to produce duplicate `type` entries.

### To Reproduce

1. Start TCP capture
2. Run `QuarkusManagementServiceIT`
3. Find an HTTP POST request for `/api/management/v1/catalogs`
4. Observe duplicate `type` keys in the payload

The same behaviour can be observed in java code by (manually) serializing a `Catalog` object to `String`.

### Actual Behavior

Example HTTP request from integration tests:

```
POST /api/management/v1/catalogs HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer ***
Content-Type: application/json
realm: POLARIS
User-Agent: Quarkus REST Client
content-length: 373
host: localhost:41133

{""type"":""INTERNAL"",""type"":""INTERNAL"",""name"":""mycatalog_1iwijzxj1hhj8"",""properties"":{""default-base-location"":""s3://bucket1/""},""createTimestamp"":null,""lastUpdateTimestamp"":null,""entityVersion"":null,""storageConfigInfo"":{""storageType"":""S3"",""roleArn"":""arn:aws:iam::012345678901:role/jdoe"",""externalId"":null,""userArn"":null,""region"":null,""storageType"":""S3"",""allowedLocations"":[]}}
```

### Expected Behavior

Each JSON attribute should appear only once.

Note: while it does not cause errors now, some tools may treat duplicate JSON attributes as errors.

as you will see the default CSP policy which is getting applied when rendering https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/rest-catalog-open-api/

is 

```
""script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://analytics.apache.org/""
```

which our current script violate (Note this doesn't get applied to developement env), to replicate this 
please go to hugo.yaml and add this to the end before rendering your websire  

```
server:
  headers:
    for: /**
    values:
      Content-Security-Policy: ""script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://analytics.apache.org/""

To mitigate this add this policy 

```
server:
  headers:
    for: /**

I did some search in ASF infra and found that there is a recent update ([INFRA ticket ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-26115) on the Content Security Policy.) Specifically, the change enforcing the following rule
```
4) Using Assets from other Domains
Assets (JavaScript files or snippets, images, fonts, CSS, etc.) from other domains cannot be loaded. All assets need to be hosted on ASF servers.

```
as documented at https://privacy.apache.org/policies/website-policy.html

It seems the shortcode we are using for rendering API docs, 
https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/20817e14e8448114226e76ab8163de35ba0fd6d2/site/layouts/shortcodes/redoc-polaris.html#L118
falls into the above category and therefore gets banned.

I think a quick solution will be to redirect API docs to a swagger editor like what Iceberg site does for IRC spec:
https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/585a338c1e9d287476462e3a6abab40b8803fc2c/site/nav.yml#L45

I was able to come at the same conclusion as the give HUGO changes for serving the static contents we create is not coming into effect. It works in local as we i,e local server is serving those static contents. 
Seems like ASF had same static serving infra which doesn't allows these cross domain serving 

Though this part is tricky as they do say `.htaccess` can be overriden if we can do that we can override the headers ? If thats true may be then we can modify CSP policy

I noticed that the current implementation of `dropTableWithPurge` doesn’t delete snapshots. I took a look into the `TaskExecution`,  `TableCleanupTaskHandler`, `ManifestFileCleanupTaskHandler`, and it appears that only the metadata JSON files, manifest files, and data files are removed.

### To Reproduce

1. Launch Polaris locally
2. Create a Polaris catalog: polaris_catalog
3. Configure Spark to connect to the local Polaris instance
4. Create a namespace: `create namespace ns;`
5. Create an Iceberg table: `create table ns.t1 (id INT, name STRING);`
6. Insert some data into it: `insert into ns.t1 values(1, 'XJKDC')`
7. Do drop table with purge: `drop table ns.t1 purge;`
8. Check the s3 bucket to see if there are some manifest lists file remaining.

### Actual Behavior

The snapshots files (manifest list files) are not deleted.

### Expected Behavior

The table location should not have any files in it after we drop the table with purge.
