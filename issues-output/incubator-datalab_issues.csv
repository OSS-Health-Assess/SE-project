-----

How it works now:
1. If library is already installed on instance (this library was previous installed during notebook creation) and user installs the same library via DLab UI. And as result DLab shows installing -> installed, but in fact this library is not installed by DLab, Dlab finds that such library is previously installed and changes status installing -> installed. This case is actual when user want to install upper version of library. So make possible to install library like <library_name==version> via DLab UI. For example, this bug was found with library 'request'.
2. Also if update Python 3 via terminal it shows that it is upgraded but in some minutes it is downgraded again. (It was on Jupyter)

**How should it work:**
- If user types wrong library version the output appears where there is a list of versions for this library
- If user types right library version this library version should be installed
- On top of that what dependencies are added during installation should be conveyed to user.  In what way it should be conveyed?
- The latest installed library should be in the top of the libraries grid.  ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-datalab/issues/717/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When the script gets to the part where it attempts an SSH connection to the EC2 instance that was created, it does the 15 attempts and seems to succeed each time, but overall it fails. Excerpt from the logs are attached.

you tried to deploy from master branch, right?
Please try to add Termination protection to SSN instance when it is created, and try to establish SSH connection from your VM to said instance with provided key and ubuntu user. 
You can also try to run deploy_datalab.py from another EC2 instance, as some networking misconfiguration of your VM on Host machine can block connection.

Is there any chance that some policy removes security group rule with allowed inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0?

If you already have some existing VPC, subnet, security group that you use to successfully connect to EC2 instances, you can try to use them with additional options
--aws_vpc_id vpc-xxxxxxxx \
--aws_subnet_id subnet-xxxxxxxx \

I was actually deploying from develop branch as that is what is specified in the documentation/README.md.

I noticed a Terraform file under infrastructure-provisioning/terraform/aws/ssn-helm-charts/main/main.tf which lists the provider as Kubernetes.

Any idea what part this file plays for Datalabs?

I have been running a Datalab instance but am not seeing any data under the billing section in the front end. AWS is definitely incurring costs as a result of Datalab ($40 for the month of June). 

Is there some specific condition that needs to be fulfilled before billing is populated?
