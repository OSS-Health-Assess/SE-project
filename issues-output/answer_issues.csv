考虑到咱们以前也一起搞过 [opensource.win](https://opensource.win/) 的事情，不妨咱们就用这套来做 Answer 社区的数字化看板，目前这套方法也在我们实验室进行实验，@frank-zsy 也在其它社区做了些试点，效果挺好，能够量化贡献并激励大家往前冲~

我们甚至发起了一个[ XSOXI 计划](https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-wonderland/discussions/196)来促进社区的发展，根据贡献度给同学们发些助研的补助，效果不错~

如果有兴趣，我们可以联合 opensource.win 提供所有的数据支持和一些可视化的工具，一起来促进 Answer 社区的发展，基于此可以做的事情很多，也算是开源社区的社会实验了~

而且，等到下个月 Answer 社区的第一个月数据出来后，还可以用 [Hypercrx 插件](https://github.com/hypertrons/hypertrons-crx)对社区进行数据观测了，目前感觉社区热度在持续增加，非常期待，哈哈~

看样子，是数据库连接出现了错误。

当我重新下载了一次源代码到另一个目录里，尝试使用docker命令，发现还是失败了。

然后，使用二进制运行，也找不到门路，让人不愉快的体验。

我看INSTALL.md，也说的不是很清楚。

总之，很难受，要搞懂这个错误，需要追踪很长的代码，有点沮丧，刚开始就感觉一座大山在前面。

我觉得缺少一个整体的系统启动流程图，让人有一个清晰的头绪，但是作为一个经典的前后端项目，它必然就很简单，但是目前我要追踪很多代码，才能让它在本机启动。

头大，现在一点思路都没有，然后。

1. 当前使用 docker 安装会在当前目录下 `$PWD/answer-data` 创建 `answer-data` 文件夹，文件夹中包含配置文件等数据，启动时候提示 `/data/conf/config.yaml already exists`，证明配置文件已经存在，如果是新的初次安装，请删除 `answer-data` 文件夹中所有相关文件。如果是第二次安装，请修改对应的配置文件 `/answer-data/conf/config.yaml` 对应的数据库连接。
2. 第二次安装看日志并没有任何问题，各项初始化看日志也是正常的，启动后直接访问即可。如果是对 `[Warning] Aborted connection 9 to db: 'answer' user: 'root' host: '172.26.0.3' (Got an error reading communication packets)` 有担心，不必担心，这是一个警告提示，是由于 `docker-compose` 的 depends_on 导致，它会不断的检测 mysql 是否正常启动，这只是由于还没有正常连接的一个提示信息，不会影响 answer 正常运行。

It obviously works if you init inside /tmp/* but that's not realistic. Most people will want the DB file somewhere inside the same folder as the answer executable, like in the binary installation instructions on your website.

No, because your website instructions don't say to do these steps. But I did those steps anyway and
the error persists.

Your binary installation instructions just say run `./answer init -C ./answer-data/` and then run `./answer run -C ./answer-data/`. Does it work for you when you download the binary to your `~/downloads` folder and then run these 2 commands inside the `answer_1.0.5_macOS_arm64 ` folder?

We will update the documentation ASAP.

Indeed, for the binary installation, the jump link(admin section) on the image will not work. This is because the `. /answer run -C ` command is not exec before. This link is more often used by users who use `docker`. We will also consider how to improve the experience when using binary installations.

如果是新版本，并且想使用 sqlite，建议直接使用命令 `docker run -d -p 9080:80 -v answer-data:/data --name answer answerdev/answer:latest` 直接启动然后进入安装链接进行安装。

如果使用docker-compose也可以参考安装文档中的方式进行安装  https://github.com/answerdev/answer/blob/main/INSTALL_CN.md

也可以手动修改配置文件中的连接
```yaml
data:
  database:
    driver: ""sqlite3""
    connection: ""sqlite db path""

I am currently working on the language version for German. But the language file (.yaml) is not shown to me under the settings.
de_DE.yaml file is available. Also i18n.yaml adapted accordingly.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create file 'de_DE.yaml' in the 'i18n' folder
2. Edit i18n.yaml file and add values for the German language file
3. Go to 'Admin > Settings > Interface'
4. Click on 'Interface Dropdown'
5. Only US and CN values available

**Expected behavior**
The language ""German"" should also be selectable.

You were not seeing the insert in source code mode (I just noticed the `source code` in parentheses, sorry).

This part of the function is implemented as follows.
* The `Custom CSS` section is converted to a `custom.css` file and inserted into the `head` when rendered on the server side.
* The `Head`, `Header`, and `Footer` sections are dynamically inserted into the corresponding sections by JavaScript during client-side rendering.

**This is why you don't see the inserted content in `source code` mode. In this case, you can see the inserted content in the `Elements` panel of the developer tools.**

However, our implementation is still buggy, **the dynamically inserted script will not run**. We will fix it as soon as possible.

This question is in two parts.

1. `/i18n/init.ts` This file is only used to build in the two languages and do the initialization of the i18n, the other language configurations are loaded on demand. There is no problem with this part.

2. The problem is that the i18n service does not receive the corresponding data after the on-demand language file has been loaded. We will fix this issue as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Please describe.**
I am planning on setting up an instance of answer in my uni, but for that I would need to limit the registrations to emails of my university. Creating the users manually is not feasible, as there are too many people to do that by hand and I would have to do so every year.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to configure an email domain, like e.g. `mail.myuni.edu`, so you could only register with a mail of the form `xxxxxx@mail.myuni.edu`, but no with `xxxxxx@myuni.edu` or `xxxxx@mail.example.com`. This should not interfere with manually created users, so when installing Answer or manually creating a user I could do `admin@myuni.edu` and it should work perfectly and allow login.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Another option could be allowing to limit emails to match a regex pattern defined by the administrator. This could also affect manually created users because you could just add an or to the regex with the email you want to create the account for. Only side effect of this is that if you manually create many accounts, the regex might get too long and matching the regex with the email would increasingly take longer. On the good side, it is way more flexible than my proposed option.

I believe otherwise. Having the title separated from the logo allows the title to follow the same font as the rest of the site, change font size easier and sync the title throughout the whole site, any change regarding this will force you to change the logo which I believe is highly impractical.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5SK5Y2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

如果有开发经验或者具有seo经验或者了解 url slug 的人员使用本项目, 目前的新建标签支持用户手动修改 url slug 可以很好解决搜索的问题,

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. create a user name with a hyphen (-) and spaces( ) and uppercase letters in the user name, during the initial setup/wizard.
2. log in as user.
3. Try and update any field for user name 'name-name'

I found this out by deploying a sidecar for GCP cloud-sql-proxy. The startup of answer happens so quickly that the cloud-sql-proxy is not completely ready to accept connections yet and then startup fails because the database is not ready. I was able to get passed this by bypassing entrypoint.sh and adding a 5 second sleep before answer init runs.

**Expected behavior**
Ideally, the process would keep trying to connect to the provided database in config.yaml if its there from a previous configuration.

**Platform (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Kubernetes (GKE)
 - Answer Version 1.0.7
 - Database: Postgres

I tried to change the backend.timeline in i18n. In theory, he should modify the content in the ""类型"" of this page. Because the context of ""提交于"" should not appear in the form.

In the Chinese context. ""提交于"" should be connected to time. But here is a table. There is no direct connection to time. So I tried to change it to ""提交"". But it failed. Maybe it used backend.question_detail

You should change the content in ui.timeline. The backend is the translation content applied to the backend, and the content below the ui is the translation content applied to the frontend.Our language file is based on the en_US.yaml file, you can see

为了解决这个问题，你可以检查你的代码，查看是否有任何尝试将空字符串赋值给 bigint 类型的操作。如果是这种情况，请确保在将值插入数据库之前先检查它是否为空。

另外，你还可以检查数据库中的表结构，确保所有 bigint 列都被定义为非空类型。如果存在空字符串的情况，你可以考虑将这些列的默认值更改为适当的非空值，或者在插入数据时显式指定这些列的值。

最后，如果你仍然无法解决问题，你可能需要进一步调查错误日志中提供的堆栈跟踪，以找到导致该错误的具体代码行。","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5aQRu8/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sorry, I noticed that you have updated the site to v1.0.9, but this translation error issue still persists. There are several issues that I would like to confirm:
1. How are you deploying `docker` or `binary`?
2. Whether you have manually modified the i18n file?
3. Whether the translation of `error.rank.vote_fail_to_meet_the_condition` exists in the `i18n/zh_CN.yaml` file after your current update ?

Please shut down the Answer service and re-execute the following command
```bash
./answer init -C ./answer-data/
./answer upgrade -C ./answer-data/
./answer run -C ./answer-data/
```
This folder `./answer-data/` needs to be specified according to the actual path that you used.

---

The following are the causes of the issue.
Since only `./answer init` command replaces the i18n file, the docker image executes the `init` command every time it reboots by default, and the binary deployment just ignores this step.
We will fix this later so that binary upgrades will also replace the latest i18n files.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5bA5V8/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

According to your log output, the upgrade was not successful and the current version should be higher or equal to 1.0.9. Please try to fix it according to the following steps.


1. Execute the following script in the database to query the current version of Answer
```sql
SELECT `version_number` FROM version WHERE id = '1'
```

2. Modify the version number to 2 levels lower
```sql
UPDATE version SET `version_number` = `version_number` - 2 WHERE id = '1'
```

3. Execute the upgrade command and see if the upgrade is normal and the upgrade log is output

I tried updating to 1.1.0, then switched back to 1.0.8 because of non-ssl smtp issues. It may be related to this.

Please describe.**
Currently, the application does not allow users to parametrize the base path, which makes it difficult to configure a reverse proxy with path routing. This lack of flexibility can hinder deployment in certain scenarios and configurations.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Please add support for parametrizing the base path within the application's configuration. This feature would enable users to set up a reverse proxy with path routing more easily and allow for seamless integration with various deployment environments. Ideally, this should be done in a way that doesn't break existing configurations.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have considered using URL rewriting to work around this limitation, but it's less efficient and can potentially cause issues with certain configurations.

**Additional context**
The ability to parametrize the base path is a common feature in many web applications and would greatly improve the flexibility and ease of deployment for the `answer` application. By supporting this feature, we can ensure that the application remains adaptable to a variety of infrastructures and configurations.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/335/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Clicking on a user raises a server error.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to Users
2. Click on a user
3. See error HTTP 50X

Server logs:
```

MySQL:

This is because an empty string is cast to `0` in both databases, thus hiding the coding error.

So, returning an empty string when the value is `nil`, equals to returning `0`. This would include results of a user with id 0 potentially.

I am not familiar with Go, but it is my understanding that an error should be returned together with the empty string, and the caller should check if there is an error (like you already do with `GetUserBasicInfoByUserName` for example) and do not add the user id as parameter if it is missing, or use a pointer (like for `GetUserInfoFromContext`).

@fenbox I have a small question: Why does a moderator need the ability to modify user settings? Moderators should be the ones managing forum content such as questions and tags, and in theory, they shouldn't have a need to modify user settings. Modifying user settings should be considered the responsibility of a system administrator, shouldn't it?

I think modifying user settings is a strange requirement, and I find it difficult to envision its use cases. For example, the boss asked us to turn off his email notifications?
I think we can ask @frafra in which specific scenarios they require administrators to modify user settings.

I tried to compile with your plugin on `mac` and `linux`, no problem, build was successful. So sorry, it's not a problem with your plugin, it might be related to `windows` platform. I am not sure if I need to specify `GOOS` `GOARCH` manually when compiling on `windows` platform. I need to find a `windows` machine to test it.  🤔

I'm trying to set up Answer in a Docker container using docker-compose, and would like to specify oauth2 configuration to connect to Azure AD, and to specify access levels based on Azure AD groups.

I've been looking at the documentation and the example plugin coded, but I still have no idea about how to do the configuration.

An entry in the documentation about how to configure.
Preferable this can be done by using environmental variables, such as (on top of my head) these:
```
   OAUTH2_TENENT_ID=
   OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=
   OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=

But it would be very convenient to set it directly in the docker-compose.yml so that all the configuration is only one place - in fact, I'd prefer if it was possible to make the Admin->Plugin page read-only, too. This will easier allow me to store the configuration in git.

Regarding the documentation of how to use Oauth2, I used the below configuration data to make it work with Azure AD. 
You are welcome to publish this as an example in your documentation.

ClientID: {Application ID}
ClientSecret: {Secret}

User ID JSON Path: id
User Display Name JSON Path: displayName
User Username JSON Path: userPrincipalName
User Email JSON Path: userPrincipalName

Check Email Verified: Off
Email Verified JSON Path: userPrincipalName

In Azure AD, the User.Read access must be granted in Enterprise Application, too.

sqlite only supports max_open_conn=1, but there are several instances where multiple db connections are opened.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open any questions page and up/down vote a comment
2. Now the website should be very unresponsive as there are processes in blocked state

**Expected behavior**
Pressing up/down vote buttons should not slow down the website.

**Platform (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: Desktop
 - OS: macOS
 - Browser: chrome
 - Version: 1.1.0

**Source code analysis**
vote_repo.go (line 78)
- session.Context(ctx) is called -> new db connection
- then, at line 90, vr.CheckRank() is called which eventually calls configService.GetConfigByKey, creating another db connection

There are several other instances of this behavior.
I think GetConfigByKey(ctx context.Context, key string)
should take session *Session, not ctx context.Context
Or we could have values from config table, loaded into cache on startup, so that config values could be read from cache all the time.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/422/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/429,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/429,answer,1788700281,429,Scrollbar bug & more,Slluxx,15162905,Slluxx,,CLOSED,2023-07-05T03:33:15Z,2023-12-25T03:36:22Z,"### Scrollbar bug
Create a new post and quickly move the mouse over the available icons in the wysiwyg editor. If you do it fast enough, multiple popups are open at the same time and one is forced into the next line, which not just looks weird, it can also shift the entire page because of a scrollbar appearing and then disappearing again. I tested this on a 1920x1080 monitor in fullscreen. If the scrollbar exists ahead of time, no noticible shift happens and the miss-placed popup is way harder to notice.

### Visists counter
The counter goes up even if the page is just refreshed. This is not acceptable as it can be used to artificially blow posts up and annoy staff / visitors. There needs to be some kind of check to prevent this. This is not easy as guests should also count but there needs some kind of check in place. Maybe not IP but a few semi-unique combined pieces of information for guests and account ids for logged in users. Doesn't need a  100% waterproof solution but at least it needs to be thought about.

### Multiple different OAuth provider
Probably belongs into answerdev/plugins but i'll note it here anyway.
Having one OAuth provider is not enough. I should be able to use as many as i want to and not be locked to one to increase the potential userbase.

### Answering my own question inside the content, not a new answer.
If i have a simple question that i want to write an answer for, i am forced to put something inside the the ""content"" textbox. Instead of forcing me to write something super obvious or just repeating the question from the title, i should be allowed to put the answer in directly. One real example:

Title: ""What are the reasons for a ban?""
Content: ""Is there a list of things that i can avoid to get banned?""
Self-Answer: ""Yes, [...]""

The person was forced to basically write the same question inside the content because the title was so self-explanatory that there was nothing of value to add. It doesn't look good, adds nothing of value and could be much more compact and readable if the person was just allowed to put the answer into that content block.

I get that not every question is that obvious and sometimes more context is needed but in hyper specialized communities, self-answered questions usually are that simple and should be accounted for.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/429/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### User deletion
Deleting a user does not really delete a user. Some information is still available in the dashboard and thus in the database. I should be able to prune/force delete to remove **everything** from that user. I am not sure what the best way to handle comments/answers on other users questions would be like (eg remove everything and replace with generic message or keep message and replace username with `deleted-user`, `banned-user` or whatever) but keeping certain userdata when specifically deleting a user is a no-go

### Compliances (GDPR/EU/...)
Cookie notices, user information requests/dumps/deletions

### Installations
When setting this up with a database and the database name can not be found, it should asked to create the database instead of throwing an error message.

Thank you for your suggestion. While we understand your point of view, Answer's design is intended to ensure high-quality content and readability. Therefore, we recommend separating questions and answers into different sections. 

If your question and answer are very simple, you can provide the same content in both sections, which will not affect the quality or readability.

I strongly disagree. Text, that doesn't add any value is superfluous and therefore not ""high-quality content"".

Currently, the website in user info page shows the domain name of user's website.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

If user's website is hosted on a well-known service like github, it would be good if it can show the service icon and username like `@conr2d`.

Customizing additional user info items can be provided as a feature of administration.

1. Pattern match the website URL with well knows hosting providers and conditionally render the corresponding icons. 
[Relevant code in repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/da490d4006281376313abd984a0e75450d6e9041/ui/src/pages/Users/Personal/components/UserInfo/index.tsx#L125)
    #### Implementation details: 
    In the above code, the icon name needs to be changed conditionally.

2.  In case of GitHub hosting, GitHub username can be found from the URL (As far as I understand the subdomain section of `github.io` in the website URL should work).
[Relevant code in repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/da490d4006281376313abd984a0e75450d6e9041/ui/src/pages/Users/Personal/components/UserInfo/index.tsx#L99)
    #### Implementation details: 
    We can add a `div` below the existing `data.username` and create a GitHub page link by concatenating  github username with githul base URL. We can additionally give the user the option to add custom GitHub profile URL instead of the one fetched from website, in case the website is hosted on some other GitHub account, for any particular reason, or disable the feature of extracting GitHub from website URL.

Please share your thoughts and feedback on these. If approved, I'm ready to proceed with implementation.

`Connector Plugin` only can help we to access the `Oauth2` Login. It can't replace the original user system directly. The `enabled_original_user_system` configuration you mentioned is used for the `UserCenter` plugin. The usage case of this plugin is that it will directly replace the original user system and use a third-party user system to log in and control the users of the whole system. For example, if a company already has an internal user system and wants to connect to Answer. After using it, all the operations about the users, including the role and status, will be proxy by `UserCenter`.

At present, we only provide the `Connector` plugin, and the `UserCenter` needs to be written according to your business.

So, if you only need to enable third-party login, then using Connector is good. If you want to directly proxy the entire user system, developing a new `UserCenter` plugin might be another option.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5iSCQv/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Generally speaking you don't need to change the code.

The reason you need to verify your email address again after using the `Connector` plugin is because the third party does not provide an email address that has already been verified.

For example, if you use `Google OAuth2` to log in, the plugin will fetch the user information returned by OAuth, which will contain the field of whether the email is verified or not, that is, the `Email Verified JSON Path`. By checking this, it will determine whether the current email has been verified by Google or not.

-----

_So, you have two choices._
The first is to completely trust the information provided by the third party. That means not checking the email. At this time, you need to turn off the email verification button.
<img width=""484"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/answerdev/answer/assets/19712692/b06358df-9e8f-4334-bc06-75f95685ed75"">

-----

Second, verify the email. Turn on the button and fill in the correct `Email Verified JSON Path` to find out if the email has been verified by the third party.
<img width=""526"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/answerdev/answer/assets/19712692/75da6c51-b5e7-4473-ac6d-1bfe03e29f43"">

**This assumes that you have configured the User Email JSON Path to retrieve the user's email correctly.**

Finally, if you don't want users to register via email, turn off the Allow email registration button so that users can only register via OAuth.
<img width=""651"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/answerdev/answer/assets/19712692/f391726f-47c4-4140-81a0-9cd44d0efc3a"">

Using it this way should meet your needs, the user can login **only** via OAuth2 and there is **no need to recheck** the email after logging in.

Based on the issue #429.

When deleting a user, sometimes it's important to keep their questions and answers to maintain the completeness of the platform's content. However, for users who have spammed the platform, it's necessary to completely delete all their content when deleting their account.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Two options:

1. Keep user content and reset all profile information
2. Delete all content and reset all profile information

原因：安装完问答系统后，使用docker-compose启动，如果mysql等数据库服务还没启动，answer服务先启动了，会导致answer服务没法连接到mysql数据库，此时访问网页会一直返回50x

临时解决方案：
在docker-compose的answer服务中，用ENTRYPOINT指令强制覆盖原有容器启动命令，让容器睡60秒再启动web服务（当然，15秒应该也足够）：

```
entrypoint: sh -c ""sleep 60 && /entrypoint.sh""
```

建议开发者在启动answer容器的时候，尝试连接数据库时，可以写个循环每隔一段时间去尝试连接，也许几秒钟之后就能连接了呢（，起码别一次连接不成功应用就寄了

If we are unable to connect to the database and keep doing retries, the first time user will not be able to enter the installation process properly(or when use want to reinstall). In general, **we believe that all middleware should be guaranteed to be up and running before the program starts**. Failure to do so may lead to other unexpected situations. Of course we will consider what you said and see if there are other ways to optimize it. Thank for your feedback.

In general, we recommend that you use `healthcheck` when deploying via docker-compose to ensure that the database is prioritized over the Answer startup.

When first creating an admin password, it lets you set what you want. However when trying to use that password to sign in, the UI caps your password at 32 characters meaning if you've set a long secure password you can't login. E.g. you lock yourself out from the start..

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a long password (e.g. 50 characters) during first set up
2. Try login to the UI

**Expected behavior**
You can set a long password and still login via the UI.

Referring to solutions such as Minio and Qiniuyun Youpaiyun, it is usually achieved by applying for a key from the OSS service and redirecting it to a real resource link with the key through 303.

As an admin user (role = admin) I'm able to edit comments of other users (edit link is show).
When ""save edits"" is pressed, the change is not persisted.

What works perfectly is editing my own comments (role = admin).

Additionally what seems (to me) to be a bit inconsistent is that I'm not offered an edit link for a comment if I have the role = user. 


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Login as user with role = admin
2. Click on 'edit' of another user's comment
3. Apply some changes to the comment
4. Click on 'save edits'
5. Refresh the page
6. Change is gone and not shown, instead the original comment is still shown

**Expected behavior**
The changed comment should be shown after clicking on 'save edits' and refresh of the page

Please describe.**
Currently, whether a local markdown file or an article reprinted from other platforms, the image links inside will not be replaced with the website's own links, which may lead to the risk of image failure.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I want a function that when publishing an article, I can automatically download and upload external link-type pictures to my own website server, and automatically replace them with pictures from my own server in the article.
I also want a plug-in that can automatically scan all the external link images in my website and do the above.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Considering that when pasting a picture, it will automatically upload the picture and write the address of the picture into the content, I think this function should not be difficult to implement.

Hello there, I have been self-hosting answer.dev for a while and in order to enhance the security I am thinking of to disable the default log in form, only use the oauth log in.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like a toggle option in settings page for the admin that we can disable the default log in form.

1. There is no requirement for the `title` to be unique in product design. Adding a unique index solely to prevent duplicate submissions is not a good practice.
2. Add index to long text is not a good practice as it can potentially impact insertion performance and increase database size.

I think we need to do the following:
1. Add a loading state to the submit button to prevent duplicate clicks during the HTTP request, which can also improve the interaction experience in weak network conditions.

Thank you! @fenbox, I was thinking of these changes to differentiate-
- Make answers have a different background color than comments
- Use bold or larger font size for answers
- Right align comments and left align answers 
- Implement threading to nest comments under answers (Identing)

the helm chart doesn work anymore, because the apiversion of the serviceaccount is being mistakenly seen as a comment. 

Removing the license header, and then the chart works again. This only happens in the service account, because it is the only one that is deployed conditional depending on the values.

This may be more of a design decision than a bug, but it seems like the questions/answer is being soft-deleted, which means that you cannot delete the tags if they where ever used on a question/answer. If this is correct, then I think it must be a mistake, that softdelete have not been implemented for the tags aswell. 

In general i think it should be possible for an administrator to delete / modify tags created by the community. I suggest to be able to delete a tag, even if it is used on an active post. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a question with a new tag that havent been used before
2. Delete the question
3. Delete the new tag

**Expected behavior**
The tag should show as being used on 0 questions and you would be able to delete the tag

**Actual behavior**
The tag is shown as being used on 1 questions, and you cannot delete the tag.

 - OS: [e.g. macOS]

It seems like the amount of data that is stored as json in the column 'avatar' of the user table, is exceeding its limits set in mysql.

Here is the json string for my avatar

{""type"":""custom"",""gravatar"":""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f449a0ac712b2575a9481318e96963b3"",""custom"":""https://answer.salecto.io/uploads/avatar/4ZkqaeTV6gf.jpeg""}

I have replaced the string in the db with this, and now my user is able to log on without error again
{""type"":""custom"",""gravatar"":"""",""custom"":""""}

I expect that the reason for this, is that I have first setup gravatar, then uploaded an image, and then the oauth tries to also add a profile image, which probably results in the json exceeding 255 characters. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Setup gravatar
2. Upload image instead
3. Setup oauth
3. Login with the user using oauth
4. See error in the console

**Expected behavior**
NIL

2. If you feel the notifications are too frequent, you can proactively turn them off. But once a day seems easy to miss. So for now, no need to make any changes.

Therefore, even after my `mysql` server has completed the restart, accessing the answer service still results in the error ""HTTP Error 50X The server encountered an error and could not complete your request."" 

The issue differs from #472 as the error does not manifest at the start of the service. However, the underlying logic error seems similar.

Please describe.

Answer is a Q&A platform, not a forum. Some users mistake the answer section for a discussion area. Despite receiving prompts to edit their original answers, they keep adding new answers, breaking down the answer into several separate responses, making it difficult to accept the correct answer.

By default, users can only write one answer to the same question.

1. Add switch option in `admin -> settings -> write`, default is ""On"".

2. When the user has answered the current question (excluding deleted ones):
   - Show “Edit my existing answer” which takes the user to the page where they can edit their answer.
   - When allowing multiple answers from the same user, display another button “Add another answer”. Clicking on it will prompt a dialog box as before.

This issue is not marked as resolved! The root cause of this problem is that we do not use SSR or SSG for SEO, so when the Google snapshot page loads our website, it will be taken over by our routing system, causing the display page to be inconsistent; this problem is still looking for a solution method;

Judging from the mode of Google caching pages, the plain text version and view source code display are correct; so the only impact caused by this problem at present is that the UI of the cached page is inconsistent with expectations;

There is a pagination issue on the answer list within the question details page. The total count of answers and the pagination list fail to load correctly. The pagination is constantly set to 1, and the total count of answers matches the number on a single page. This bug occurs across all devices and operating systems, and is independent of the browser and its version.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the question details page.
2. Observe the answer list section.
3. Notice that the pagination is always set to 1, regardless of the number of answers.
4. Observe that the total count of answers is equal to the number of answers on one page, indicating a failure in loading the correct total.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is that the answer list should correctly load with appropriate pagination. The total count of answers should reflect the actual number of answers available, and pagination should adjust accordingly, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages if necessary.

Answers are not paged because current technology would cause performance degradation if the url of an answer was accessed directly, so given that there aren't many answers yet, there is no paging.

eg: When you visit this answer link: https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D13i/E14i；We need to display the answer with id=E14i. If the answer is not on the current page,performance will be affected! Therefore, paging has not been used here.

In the situation you described, there indeed exists such an issue, and perhaps we can improve it in this way: 

- if the Q&A in the link exists on the first page of the answer list, then we can simply scroll to the corresponding position; 
- if the answer is not on the first page, then we can add a 'Related Answer' section at the front of the answer list to directly load and display this answer, avoiding the need to handle subsequent pagination issues;

@notfresh Thank you for your question. Yes, the two have different validation rules. Since avatars may come from different sources such as gravatar. So it is currently left open for avatars. Since the essential aspect of this requirement is actually that we don't want the content of the user's **question or answer** to be posted somewhere else in private mode. Surely, we will consider your point about private access for avatars though.

Honestly I am not sure if this is just me, or if it is a bug. 
I see a bookmark section under my user profile

I would assume that this makes it possible to bookmarks questions/answers, and then they would appear in this section. 
My problem is that I see no option for adding a post/question to a bookmark at all. 

In the code it looks like it is hardcoded to allways be hidden in the component.

Or you can check the cause of the problem yourself.

1.  make sure the format of the icon you converted to base64 is svg.
eg:
```

I tested it using the data you provided （of course you need to remove the `data:image/svg+xml;base64` characters

）, and the display is normal. Try it again over there and see if it's normal. If you still have problems, you can continue to discuss them.

Special characters in tags causes answer to assume incorrect urls. For instance a forward slash will be accepted in the tag, which obviously causes a problem in a url

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a tag with a forward slash ""Something / something""
2. See that the url that answer uses for the tag is https://yourdomain/tags/Something-/-something
3. Try and visit this url, and you will get a 404

**Expected behavior**
I expected that answer will either not allow special characters when creating tag, or would url-encode before creating the url.

when adding a new question, the corresponding tags will not be synced to search plugin because the `TagRel` entities have not been created yet.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. enable one of the search plugin, e.g. elastic search
2. enable the search plugin in Admin page.
3. add a new question with tags.
4. after question created, you can find that the tags have not been synced to the search plugin.

**Expected behavior**
question as well as its tags are all synced to search plugin. The root cause is that the `TagRel` entities are not been created yet when updating search.

Thank you for your contribution and we will be reviewing it ASAP. The difference between the mai and dev branch is simple: the main branch goes straight to the latest release(v1.2.1), whereas dev goes to the next release(v1.2.5). If we set a milestone(v1.2.5) for this issue to be fixed in the next release, so it's better to start development base on the dev branch.

Not sure when it started (maybe with 1.2.1 or after running 1.2.1 for some days, but not sure), and have no idea how to analyze the following issue:

Uploading images works well, they're written to the `updates` folder in the file system.
But when displaying them, answer returns a HTTP 302 redirecting to `/403`.

Uploaded avatars and the brand image are still working.

There are no additional information in debug log, pardon me, I've no idea how to taggle this.

The installation is private, when changing it to public, images are shown. so it seems to be related to login session handling for images downloads.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. having a private answer 
1. deploy a rebuild answer binary (`answer build --with-plugins...`)
1. uploaded images result int http 302 -> /403 ![image](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/assets/40993644/09adc3e4-b87b-404e-96c1-875544851699) 
1. clear cookie `visit` and reload page
1. uploaded images work again

### Expected behavior

Uploaded images continue to being shown also after answer updates

### Screenshots

If applicable, add screenshots or video to help explain your problem.

### Platform

- Device: Any
- OS: Official answer container image
- Version: v1.2.1 `--with-plugins`

Yep. In fact, we should add a reminder that users need to re-login after turning on the privacy mode to ensure that the uploading of images functions properly. Re-login is actually what you say ""force renewal of all session"".","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5wlAe1/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

that did not help in our case, can confirm, that other users hat the same issue, and only clearing the browser cache helped.
even while private mode was enabled, newly uploaded images (and existing ones) could not be GET. re-login didn't help, only purging the entire browser cache.

a server restart with a new deployment (newly `answer build --with-plugins` with same versions) seemed to cause the issues. trying to reproduce it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5wlFyo/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks for the feedback. There are a few other questions I'd like to ask you. Sorry for the more questions, as I really didn't reproduce the problem following your steps. So I need your help.

1. Do you need to log in again after restarting with a new deployment? I want to make sure the cache is working properly.
2. If you don't restart is everything ok? 
3. You're just using domain access right?
4. What browser are you using?

I think the key to the problem, as you describe it, would be in the cookie. 🤔","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5wlrXa/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

yes, after the server restart, clients are logged out automatically

yes, even restarts with an unchanged answer binary doesn't cause issues

what do you mean? Answer is accessed on a certain domain using the basic oauth connector as only login/registration method. private mode, so nothing but the ""connect with ..."" button visible for the public

In the configuration file, there is a `file_path` where the cached data is stored. The Answer caches the user's login information and puts it there. If you persist this file, it prevents from logout users after restart. However, I'm not sure if this is the cause. Just a guess.

None.

## Describe the solution you'd like

I would like to suggest opening up REST API documentation for the answer project to allow secondary development by third-party developers and partners.

Providing API documentation could enable the creation of integrations and add-on applications that enhance the capabilities of answer. Some ideas include mobile apps, browser extensions, or import/export tools for answer content.

Opening the API with thorough documentation and examples would make it easier for external developers to build on top of answer in innovative ways. It would also demonstrate an openness and willingness to work with the developer community.

I'm happy to discuss API capabilities that would be most useful for integrations with the answer team. Please consider opening access to read and write APIs to grow an ecosystem around the product.

redis cache not effect

When I turn on the redis cache plugin in the admin, the system is actually running a local file cache

When initializing in cmd/wire_gen.go, the cache is initialized before the plugin is initialized, so data.NewCache is false to read the plugin, and the result is still read file cache.

### Description
I am experiencing an issue where new answers are not updating in MeiliSearch when using the MeiliSearch plugin.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Update the answers in the system.
2. Observe the behavior in MeiliSearch.

### Expected Behavior
New answers should be updated in MeiliSearch.

### Actual Behavior
New answers are not being updated in MeiliSearch.

### Debugging Information
While debugging, I encountered an error message stating ""a pointer to a pointer is not allowed"" at line 417 in `answer_repo.go`. Here is a screenshot of the error:

![Error screenshot](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/assets/7039555/ea9357e1-59b9-4352-ae11-b8af69884c03)

I suspect the issue might be related to the question instance initialization. As a workaround, I modified the initialization of the question instance, which seemed to resolve the issue temporarily. Here's the screenshot post-modification:

Is this a known bug? Can anyone confirm if the issue is indeed related to the initialization of the question instance?

Why is the system reset (restored to initialized system) every once in a while? This will cause the system to become inaccessible. The system will be restored after 5 or 6 minutes, and no error message will appear in the log. Is there a scheduled task running?

Please describe

It is possible that questions can be considered different based on tags attached. Adding tags shouldn't become burden while asking questions.

## Describe the solution you'd like

Supporting Tag Hierarchy support.

- it's a group of groups, nothing but Acyclic graphs (i.e. Trees).
- Nodes can also have the same name. for example: Maintenace can be part of system group / infra group etc. in this case using UI dropdown user can select relevant groups based on his question.
- can Also have multiple roots (i.e. graphs / trees) if admin doesn't choose to join them to a single parent.

an Example hierarchy
```
HR
├── location (name)
│   └── sub-location (name)
├── Pay Slip
└── Admin


Infra
├── location (name)
│   └── sub-location (name)
├── admin
└── maintenance
    └── prod support
```


If they chose to tag child tag (all the parents would also apply to that question).

It is also helpful for those who take ownership for answering these questions. Tag Hierarchy will enhance question visibility especially when people track questions based on tags

As the number of groups grows it will become harder and harder to manage for admins. That's where hierarchy kicks in, help in not doing repeated grouping.

changing values in i18n folder in data folder is not getting reflected. even when you restart go server.

but if we run make UI command, then changes are reflected

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

This is Dev setup repo steps. Same works in Prod setup (docker version & containers)

1. initialize the project

```sh
go run cmd/answer/main.go init -C ./answer-data
```

2. Run answer
```sh
go run cmd/answer/main.go run -C ./answer-data
```

3. Since you have done init. you will be having files in answer-data folder
4. go to i18n folder choose config file based on language you have used
5. Make change to the config file
6. Check you i18n changes are getting reflected. If Not try restart answer server to see changes are getting reflected 
7. Verdit Changes are Not reflected

But only if we do changes in i18n folder (in repo not in answer-data folder)  and go through build process then changes are getting reflected


### Expected behavior

configs are supposed to work as expected

### Screenshots

If applicable, add screenshots or video to help explain your problem.

no i don't think so. if it was created for container environment, why not just do `Connection: ""answer-test-data.db""`

Hello, I have reviewed your description and first of all, the `FetchExcept` method is a universal method that cannot be changed, You need add new method.

Then our consideration here is that when doing string truncation, if multiple keywords are submitted during the search, we will take the first keyword and 100 characters before and after it to truncate and display.

If you can solve it, you can submit a PR.

All core logic is completed in main.js。

Secondly, React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI) rather than a progressive web App,  of course you can use CRA to build PWA applications.

Finally, the real core of the problem here is that main.js is indeed a bit large. If the user does not enable http caching, or the network conditions are not good, it will cause the file to take too long to load,in response to this situation,I will split main.js in one of the next releases, so please be patient.

By the way, is the default internet speed on your side slow 3G? Or are you just trying to test a bad network situation? Because I conducted a test on stackoverflow. When I used the slow3G network speed to test the resource speed of stackoverflow, I found that it also takes more than 8 seconds to load their resources, so the network is also a very important factor.

When question A references the link of question B, A will be associated as a backlink to B and displayed on the page of question B.

- **Establish link under following conditions**:
  - When question A is approved and in normal status
    - The content includes a link to question B (either a question or an answer)
    - OR an approved answer contains a link to question B (either a question or an answer)
  - When question A is closed
    - The closure reason includes a link to question B (either a question or an answer)

- **Remove link under following conditions**:
  - When question A is deleted
  - When question A is in normal status
    - The content and answers no longer contain a link to question B (either a question or an answer)
    - OR all answers containing a link to question B are deleted

**Other rules**:
  - Display up to 5 posts, sorted by question popularity
  - Click ""More"" to visit ""all linked questions"" page
  - Do not link the question itself


**Design file**:

I originally wanted to set the user default when initializing, but I found that I could not get it, and I did not pass it on when executing the plug-in

Then I modified the source code to get the language when it was initialized.
1. Modifying the `wecom_user_center.go` file of project user-center-wecom.
The plugin gets the language and sets it.
2. Modifying the `user_center.go` and `plugin.go` file of project answer.
The language of the current environment is exposed to all plug-ins.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. The global language is zh_CN;
2. Log in to wecom by scanning codes.
4. Set personal Settings to enable message subscription, including mail and wecom;
5. Create questions;
6. Others comment or answer;
7. The default subscription message received should be global language zh_CN;

### Expected behavior

The language in the context should be available in the plugin, and modifications to the wecom plugin are supported.

@surapuramakhil This workaround misses question level features such as bookmark and gamification (losing its nature).

@fenbox Should it be made configurable for admins? Like

The description is concise, I agree, but is it possible to keep the title to: Ask the Community.
It sounds inclusive, encourages collaboration, and shows open nature.
Since we've already had Invite in the description, why bother again in the title?
 
As for description, Invite people who you think can answer this question. That sounds smoother.

Yes, this issue does need more consideration. This ""Explicit requests"" process requires some security mechanism to prove that a request is sent by the true owner of that account. An admin cannot simply change email for a user when he receives a request.

As for #346 , it lets the admin do that change when the admin is confident about the changing. It doesn't involve the aspect of how a user proves who he is.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc54RMG_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thank you! I'll try the basic connector later. I also encountered this ""does not provide a unique UserID"" problem when using Google connector. I thought maybe it only happened in development for there being a frontend port and a backend port.

Uploaded images become inaccessible after the domain was changed. I only tested it in development env.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Under `domain.old`, you uploaded your custom avatar.
2. You updated `domain.old` to `domain.new`, and the uploaded avatar became inaccessible.
    - Domain changes are very common.

### Expected behavior

Uploaded files should serve well no matter what the domain is.

@LinkinStars 
Yeah, uploaded files should be stored as relative paths. And, for those already deployed in production, the fixing should implement a mechanism to automatically update existing data.

- This could be done by an independent command line tool. or
- During the installation. or
- In the backend code, auto rewrite those stored paths when fetching them.

@Octobug Your suggestion is great. We have carefully discussed this issue for some time and believe that providing a command-line solution would be better.

For example, we can offer a functionality like this:

```bash
./answer fix image from A to B
```

This command can modify the domain name in existing data.

The reasons for this are as follows:

1. Existing users may not prefer using relative paths to access images.
2. Answer supports storage plugins, allowing users to upload images to other locations, such like S3 or OSS. In such cases, the saved image may have a different absolute domain path, such as `https://s3.east-1.xxx.com/`. Of course, this is just a possibility. By providing this command-line tool, we can assist users in making the switch when they want to change their storage and update this part of the address.

Additionally, there is another requirement. We believe it would be helpful to provide an environment variable, `ABSOLUTE_IMAGE_PATH`, which users can set to true. In this way, Answer will default to using absolute paths for storing images. This consideration is made for existing users who may copy the content to other places where the images won't display if relative paths are used.

Once again, thank you very much for suggesting this feature because we believe it could pose a little big challenge. What do you think? If there are any unclear points, we can continue the discussion.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc54Dt91/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

⚠️ I haven't read much of the relevant code yet so I might miss some background knowledge of Answer. I'll make a summary to see if I have understood correctly.

I am also in favor of building this functionality as a `./answer` command option.

And let's split a URL into 2 major parts for the convenience in describing:

- `PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME:PORT`
- `PATH`
  - `BASE_PATH`
  - `RELATIVE_PATH`

I think the `ABSOLUTE_IMAGE_PATH` could be renamed to `IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX` (if there will be other types of files in the future, maybe it could be `UPLOADS_PATH_PREFIX`).

There are 2 major types of uploaded files:

1. For any external storage provided by 3rd-party services (S3, OSS, ...), files are stored as `PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME:PORT + PATH` in DB with no doubt.
2. For files stored locally, application codes can directly use `IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX + RELATIVE_PATH`, only `RELATIVE_PATH` is stored in DB. This usage of `IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX` can be delivered by documentation:
    - 2.1. By default, the value of `IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX` is `/`
    - 2.2. For files need to be moved to a new directory, the value of `IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX` is `BASE_PATH` (e.g. `new/dirname/`)
    - ~~2.3. For files need to be moved to another self-hosted place different from the Answer instance, the value of `IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX` is `PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME:PORT + BASE_PATH` (e.g. `https://statics.self-hosted.com/uploads/`).~~ Update: Uploading would be a problem. Better not to support it. 

Pseudocode:

```js
// When fetching existing data to rewrite:
getImageURL(image) {
    if (isLocalFile(image)) { // an image has a property to be distinguished. e.g. !startsWith('http')
        return IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX + image.path;
    } else {
        return image.path;
    }
}
```

~~As for the `./answer fix image from a to b` command, I think the `from a` and `to b` args are not needed. Because what are stored in DB are always `RELATIVE_PATH`s.~~

Update: for files stored in external places, these args are needed.

~~- Or, are the two args used for auto-migrating uploaded files (`mv SRC DST`)?~~
~~- The description above assumes that an admin move uploaded files manually.~~

Update:

- `IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX` is used to fix the existing problem: After this problem is fixed, domain changes don't need any extra operations.
- `./answer migrate image from a to b` is used to provide a migration feature: When you change external storage type, migration is inevitable.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc54EYCQ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have another thought on **external storage type**...

If the uploads dataset is huge, the migration could be very time-consuming because it needs to query & filter out **all** urls of avatars and urls in texts of questions & answers, and then write them back to DB.

What if Answer saves all types of uploads with relative paths with a prefix marker? Like: `:NUM:/uploads/post/57pxxvykQFj.jpeg`

`:NUM:` is a storage url prefix version number. And the version number maps to a URL prefix string, which is used to replace the `:NUM:` marker in a relative path stored in DB.

The default value of `NUM` is `0` mapping to `""/""`, it deals with local uploads type. When an Answer admin decides to move the `uploads` directory to another path, the admin just needs to change `0` to map to `""/new/path""` after files are settled down.

If the admin adds an external storage, since there is a `visit_url_prefix` config field for every storage plugin, Answer knows if it is a new prefix. If it is, it increases `NUM`, and set it as active so that any subsequent uploads use the new active `NUM`.

Let's say there is a new type of `site_info` called `uploads`, it looks like:

```json
{
    ""url_prefix_versions"": {
        ""0"": {
            // "":0:/uploads/post/57pxxvykQFj.jpeg""
            ""active"": true,
            ""value"": ""/""
        },
        ""1"": {
            // "":1:/uploads/post/57pxxvykQFj.jpeg""
            ""active"": false,
            ""value"": ""https://s3.east-1.xxx.com/""
        },
        ""2"": {
            // "":2:/uploads/post/57pxxvykQFj.jpeg""
            ""active"": true,
            ""value"": ""https://abc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/""
        },
        ...
    },

    // other properties...
}
```

With this solution, those relative paths hardly need to be changed.

The basic migrate operation process is:

1. The admin copies their uploads to another place.
2. Then the admin updates the corresponding `NUM`'s mapping.
3. The admin now can delete uploads in the old place.

And still, `./answer migrate uploads from_a to_b` could be treated as the last resort to rewrite paths in DB. And if the version number solution is adopted, this migrate functionality is better to support both command line and the admin UI. It can provide migration status like progress, affected number of urls, etc.

However, migration of large dataset may not be common. The consideration here is whether it is worth implementing such a feature to address a rare scenario.

If this idea is rejected, I will try to implement the previously discussed solution.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc54NsGC/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We have had a detailed discussion regarding your proposal. It is certain that using external storage for migration would make it somewhat easier.

However, we still have some considerations:

1. For regular users, this additional configuration would require extra understanding, thus increasing the learning curve for them.
2. There would be an additional number in the path, which might appear **slightly** odd to users.
3. As you also mentioned, this migration is a very infrequent operation and might only be performed once. This point convinced us.

I can't agree more. 👍 Yes, supported both in config file and env would be better.

We believe it would be helpful to provide an environment variable, `ABSOLUTE_IMAGE_PATH`, which users can set to true. In this way, Answer will default to using absolute paths for storing images. ***This consideration is made for existing users who may copy the content to other places where the images won't display if relative paths are used***.

@LinkinStars I made some attempts on the var part. The consideration you mentioned before (I made it bold & italic) seemd hard to achieve: **The var (`UPLOAD_URL_PREFIX`) is closely associated with [`service_config.upload_path`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/9ebf95cacecf49ff466e47f3ff54c180eb67627c/configs/config.yaml#L35)**.

- If an admin moves the uploaded files **locally**, they need to change `service_config.upload_path` at the same time:
  - And Answer's static router also needs to be changed: <https://github.com/Octobug/incubator-answer/blob/8a8086c87b188e60d9310e234fc3c5353c43f46e/internal/router/static_router.go#L42>
  - Otherwise they need to use other static server (e.g. Nginx) to serve the files. Is this acceptable?
    <img width=""1080"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/assets/8007022/bfba26d7-9f5b-48cf-b13a-35ce42a036bf"">
- If an admin moves the uploaded files to other host that needs to be accessed via an absolute URL, `UPLOAD_URL_PREFIX` doesn't help at all. Because `service_config.upload_path` cannot reach to other host.
  - This var seems to be unnecessary for absolute URLs. Uploading files via plugins also doesn't need it.

If using a symlink pointing to the locally moved uploaded files is acceptable (tell admins to do so in the documentation), the var seems to be unnecessary at all. Answer is able to distinguish these two types of uploads without an env var:

- Absolute URL for uploading via plugins.
- Relative URL for uploading locally.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc547NP6/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@LinkinStars 

Right, there are three scenarios for now. But scenario `2.` seems weird 🤔️. What benefits does storing absolute URLs bring (we don't have disagreement on `3.`)? The only benefit I can think of is that admins can use a reverse proxy server (like Nginx) to route the requests of these absolute URLs to where those uploaded files are (maybe another host different from Answer's host).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc55AaD7/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@Octobug 👍 What you said is absolutely correct. We are indeed concerned about the existence of such users. As far as I know, there are users who deploy their frontend and backend separately, and as you mentioned, images are accessed through `nginx` proxy. Of course, this is only do for compatibility reasons. This is also why it is treated as an environment variable rather than a configuration item placed in the admin page.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc55EXPR/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

`answer fix upload SRC_PREFIX DST_PREFIX [--continue] [--offline|online] [--dry-run] [--limit NUM]`

When the fix command starts, it checks if there is a tmp file: `.fix_upload_interrupted`.

1. If there isn't, it generates one.
2. If there is, it tells the user that the previous fix was interrupted, and the user needs to remove the file if they are to start a fresh fix, or uses the `--continue` switch to continue.
3. When there isn't any data left that matches the `SRC_PREFIX`, it removes `.fix_upload_interrupted` then exit.

Switches:

- `--continue`: the execution might be interrutped, some of the data is rewritten and the rest of them isn't. It works with the `.fix_upload_interrupted`.
  - All data that matches the `DST_PREFIX` will be ignored.
  - This switch is for a corner case, which is not idempotent:
    - `fix upload /uploads/ /uploads/a/`, assume it is interrupted during its running
    - run it again, resulting `/uploads/a/a/`
- `--offline`: it requires the admin to shut down the Answer site, and it works in batch mode.
- `--online`: it allows the fix to happen when a Answer site is up. It fixes a row of data one at a time in a loop, locks the data row preventing it from being loaded into the web editor, so that the user won't submit the wrong version of links after the fix is done.
  - But this kind of ""read lock"" seems impossible. I haven't done any research on it. This switch might not be feasible.
- If it is feasible in go command, I would like to implement smaller granularity fix: `fix upload [branding|avatar|question]`
- `--dry-run`: only do the test. It shows what data will be affected, the ""before"" and ""after"", with a limit (e.g. first 10 entries).
- `--limit`: fix `NUM` rows then exit.

---

**Updated at 2024-07-17 22:40**

It makes little sense to lock a data row no matter it's an online or offline fix. Because you cannot make sure that there aren't any web UI editors opened with old data loaded in it. Even after an offline fix is finished, there might still be a user going to submit the old version data.

So, neither way is perfect. This corner case can only be addressed by the documentation work I guess.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc5_F_uD/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

My previous understanding is that you want the plugin to have the ability to upgrade database fields. In the context of Answer, **migration** specifically refers to the steps involved in **upgrading** from version A to version B.

Firstly, you want the plugin to have the ability to manipulate database table structures, such as modifying existing table structures, right? 

Secondly, you want the plugin to have the ability to migrate data in order to obtain data from the Answer itself, right?

May continue providing further details on the **capabilities** that should be included. For example, specify the specific abilities the plugin should have and the type of data it needs to access. For example, want the plugin to be able to access data related to question-and-answer content.

> Firstly, you want the plugin to have the ability to manipulate database table structures, such as modifying existing table structures, right?

Right words is plugin should have support creating its own tables, extending existing tables (joins are expensive), Adding Indexes (for performance optimization wrt plugin use cases). I support you wrt modifying existing tables 
There is a difference between extending tables (adding new column) and modification (rename and dropping column).

When it comes to data Access - (Migration tool ideally should take care of assigning ownership, like who created that able), ownership of columns (who added column)
Rights for owners module would be different to others. Modules which has ownership - has full control and other modules will only by having read-only access.

Examples of modules - incubator-answer, google-connector, basic-connector, Slack Notification ..... etc

Building everything in one go would be tough, complicated and uncertainly do exits. For now, plugins having their migration sequence https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/main/internal/migrations/migrations.go and DB access would be a starting point.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc54F7ga/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We are thinking about adding a reaction feature to:

1. Increase interaction among users
2. Reduce meaningless comments.

This is because the community's voting system has reputation thresholds and limited usage scenarios. Reactions will not affect reputation.

## Description

### Task 1

- [x] Change ""Add a comment"" button style, like [`btn-light`](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/#variants) with small size and pill style

![image](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/assets/360618/cc4c44ca-8e04-4e08-a1ae-3f346f6cebf8)

### Task 2

- [x] Add reactions

![image](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/assets/360618/e67b722b-9b11-42a2-9071-6e428a33f877)

**Rules**

- All actived user can add reaction, like github issue.
- Reaction include:
  - Emoji: heart, smile, frown
  - Response count: Users who added on that emoji
- When moving to an existing reaction, show which people clicked on that emoji, display the first 5 users and ""{{n}} more..."" for the rest.
- When clicking on an existing emoji, that emoji +1.
- Clicking on the `+` shows available emojis to choose from, and selecting one will increase that reaction count by 1.
- No need for system notifications.
- Reaction does not affect reputation.

I edited a question a few times yesterday and noticed that there is an infinite redirect on refresh.

### To Reproduce

1. Go here: https://godev.com/questions
2. Find the post titled: **How do I get started learning Go?**
3. Click it and notice question loads.
4. Refresh the page and note an infinite redirect

Also note if you view other questions refreshing the page doesn't have the same redirect issue.

### Expected behavior

Refreshing page for an edited question doesn't result in infinite redirect? I haven't had a chance to dig into it more yet. Or compare by editing other posts. Sharing here incase someone has seen it or might have an idea.

@zahash This is caused by the fact that there is a question mark(?) in the title of the question. So, I'm still testing to see if there are any other special characters that could cause this problem. 🧐 

The loop is

`/questions/:questionID/:questionTitle`
-> 
`/questions/:questionID/:questionTitle/:answerID(not exist)`
-> 
`/questions/:questionID/:questionTitle`


Because the `/questions/:questionID/:answerID` is also a correct path. We need to identify if the `questionTitle` is a title or answerID. In this circumstances, It's a parsing error.

It's probably not just the special symbols that causes this problem. My final solution was to make sure that the correct answer ID must exist.

@prithvidasgupta Good. Let me describe the problem indetail.

In `/tag` POST API service, the one used to add a tag, you can see that there is formatting for the tag's `slug_name`. https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/8670e332345136422a580d661d7ee47a67f284cb/internal/service/tag_common/tag_common.go#L324-L325

In `/tag` PUT API service, the one used to update the tag, you can see that there is no formatting. https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/8670e332345136422a580d661d7ee47a67f284cb/internal/service/tag_common/tag_common.go#L822

So, just add the same formatting code to the PUT API service.

BTW, the `SlugName` should be `slugName`. You can fix the typo at the same time.

Maybe you can use `unique.NewUniqueIDRepo(&data.Data{DB: engine})`. If you think this way is too troublesome, you also can use the `engine *xorm.Engine` to `Insert` directly.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc57fCUU/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

I'm trying to set up Answer in my SAP BTP Kyma runtime(aka managed K8s), confirmed that basic functions(Q&A) works well,  and would like to specify OAuth2 configuation to connect my Identity Provider.

It looks that configuration tasks are almost done, but it fails after logging and erros occurrs as below.

---error message in my K8s Pod.
2024-04-21 13:50:00.316 ERROR   connector-basic/basic.go:155    fail to get user id from json path: email

--error screen in my web page.

### To Reproduce
It's possible to reproduce, but if you really need to, we'll pass along the information you need to configure it.


### Expected behavior

Can I modify the original source and leave a log for debugging?
Here is the source for the step before the error occurs, and I would like to see the data and userinfo.

----connector-basic/basic.go
	data, _ := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
	
	userInfo = plugin.ExternalLoginUserInfo{
		MetaInfo: string(data),
	}


A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

### Screenshots

see the attached file for error screen.

### Platform

- Device: Desktop
- OS: K8S. my desktop : Mac book M1
- Browser and version: Chrome, Safari

@micol92 

Is the OAuth2 implemented by yourself? If it is self-implemented, you need to return the JSON data in the API response, and the JSON should include a unique identifier, like `user_id` or something else. 

If you have configured another OAuth2 service, please tell us which one you have configured. Google?

Additionally, providing your OAuth configuration can help us pinpoint the issue.


> Can I modify the original source and leave a log for debugging?

You can build docker image with your own plugins. FYI: https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins#build-docker-image-with-plugin-from-answer-base-image

> Here is the source for the step before the error occurs, and I would like to see the data and userinfo.

Let me make it clear.

OAuth2 servier response JSON will be like.

```json
{
    ""user_id"": ""xxx"",
    ""eamil"": ""exp@xxx.com""
}
```

The `User ID JSON Path` should config like `user_id`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc57Qu98/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thank you for your reply. 

SAP BTP(Cloud Platform) provides IAS(Identity Authentication Service), and I used it for OAuth2 service.
For the OAuth2 configuration, see the attached file.

![Apache_Answer_OAuth2_Basic](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/assets/39489882/3cbc8d91-42c9-4084-b2f5-f07c3cca9e26)

And OAuth2 response JSON is as followings. Please note what value I should use for User ID JSON Path.

```
{
  ""firstname"": ""Jungwoo"",
  ""lastname"": ""Han"",
  ""email"": ""jungwoo.han@sap.com"",
  ""name"": ""jungwoo.han@sap.com"",
  ""scopes"": [
    ""openid"",
    ""uaa.user""
  ],
  ""displayName"": ""Jungwoo Han (jungwoo.han@sap.com)""
}
```

For debugging the second source, I tried the following.
Before the source code where the error occurs, I added some source code to get some information.
And then, I tried to build using the guide link for source debugging and failed, so please make sure my Dockerfile is correct.

```

I've modified ""basic.go"" file you mentioned, but it failed. Please review the error log below. 
And also ran the ""npm install -g pnpm@8.9.2"".

By any chance, could you share a docker image that reflects the source code I'm curious about?
This is probably the best option for quick debugging.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/929,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/929,answer,2267279959,929,UI (without the backend) goes to the landing page.,prithvidasgupta,106804681,Prithvi,,CLOSED,2024-04-28T01:03:36Z,2024-04-28T01:45:11Z,"## Describe the bug

The UI starts displaying the QA list home page when the backend is not available. It should ideally display a global error page instead of the empty QA page (so as not to confuse users).

### To Reproduce
Start the UI server without the backend

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Run `make ui`
2. Only run `pnpm start`. Do not start backend Go service.
3. Open the UI link in browser

### Expected behavior

A global error page should be made visible. This would prevent users from:

- Thinking the website is up and keeping reloading the site when the backend is down.
- Making the users aware that the site is down (quick to failure).

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Log in
2. Ask a question
3. Notice the view counter
4. Keep refreshing the question detail page
5. Notice view counter keeps increasing

@Dev-Wiki This error shows that the table is not currently in the database, but it should have been created in a very early version(v1.0.5). This is a bit strange. If you find that the table does not exist in the database, you can try using the following command to fix it.

```
# enter container
docker exec -it answer bash

# upgrade from the low version to latest
answer upgrade -f v1.0.5 -C /data/

From a technical point of view, this is indeed the case. Using json is more intuitive and easier to parse.

When filling out answers, if the website theme is dark, the color of the hyperlinks filled in the answers is difficult to distinguish from the background color. It is simply too dark.

I suggest adding a color to `.cm-line span` for the theme color; it should be much better. I am currently using `#ff8080`.

An alternative solution could be to adjust the background color instead, but adding a color to `.cm-line span` seems to be a more straightforward and effective approach.

Please describe

I'm currently running in an environment which disables by default running on port 80, yes even if the port is exposed in a container (relates to some internal functionality), I've discovered that the only way to set it up is by changing the `config.yaml` -> `server.http.addr`  port value.

## Describe the solution you'd like
I would love to just have a field that allowed me to set the site port in the installation steps.

## Describe alternatives you've considered

The alternative would be editing manually the `config.yaml` file which isn't that bad but adding it in the installation steps could be nicer.

- Device: Desktop
- Branch: main

### Solution
After taking a look at the `Makefile` I found the line that broke the script:
```
#Makefile
11: GO=$(GO_ENV) $(shell which go)
```

I Fixed it by adding quotes like this:
```
11:GO=$(GO_ENV) ""$(shell which go)""
```

tested it both on Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows 11 and seems to be working!

The goal is to leverage distributed ledger technologies and peer-to-peer systems to create a knowledge-sharing platform that is resilient, transparent, and user-driven.

Rationale:

Increased Security and Transparency: Decentralization can reduce the risk of single points of failure and enhance data integrity by making it immutable and verifiable.
Enhanced User Participation: A decentralized platform empowers users to contribute and govern the system without centralized restrictions.
Resilience: A distributed architecture can provide better uptime and fault tolerance.
Proposed Features:

Decentralized Data Storage: Implement a system using technologies such as IPFS or similar distributed file storage mechanisms to store questions, answers, and related metadata.
Blockchain Integration: Utilize blockchain technology for recording transactions, such as user contributions, votes, and rewards. Smart contracts could govern the incentive and moderation mechanisms.
Incentive Mechanism: Develop a token-based incentive system to reward users for their contributions, including asking questions, providing answers, and moderating content.
Community Governance: Introduce a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model for community-driven decision-making and content moderation.
Technical Considerations:

Scalability: How to ensure the system can handle a large number of users and transactions efficiently.
Usability: Ensuring that the decentralized version remains user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users.
Security: Protecting the platform from common vulnerabilities and ensuring the safety of user data.
Open Questions:

Which blockchain platform is best suited for this project?
What is the most effective way to integrate decentralized storage solutions?
How can we maintain a high-quality standard of content with a decentralized moderation system?
Next Steps:

Gather feedback from the community.
Conduct a feasibility study to explore various technologies and frameworks.
Create a detailed project roadmap with milestones and deliverables.
Conclusion:

Developing a decentralized version of Apache Answer can address some of the limitations of the current centralized model and open up new possibilities for user engagement and system robustness. Your insights and suggestions are invaluable to make this project a success.

- [Apache Answer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation.
- [Logto ](https://github.com/logto-io/logto)is an open-source Auth0 alternative designed for modern apps and SaaS products.
I hope to use Logto as the user center of Answer and provide authorization for Answer.

Logto provides OIDC, and Answer supports OAuth2.0.
I understand that OIDC is a superset of OAuth2.0, but when I use it together, it return an error. I wonder if these two great tools can be used together.
I have fully configured the information of Logto in Answer, so I can jump to the login page. After the login callback, this process returns invalid request information.

```log
ERROR	controller/connector_controller.go:130	connector received failed, error info: code exchange failed: oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request
Response: {""code"":""oidc.invalid_request"",""message"":""Request is invalid."",""error"":""invalid_request"",""error_description"":""missing required parameter 'code'""}, response data is:
```

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Open Logto and create a OIDC Application;
2. Set Logto info into Answer Oauth2.0 plugin;
3. Set [Answer callback uri](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/connector-basic) into Logto;
4. Start Login, input correct account info and click login.
5. Wait callback, then log error info.

### Expected behavior

Login Success.

### Screenshots

Nan.

### Platform

- Device: [iPhone 15 Pro]
- OS: [ios]
- Browser and version: [Safari]
- Version: [v1.3.6]

Thank you for your efforts to make such a great tool.
If you think this is not a bug of Answer, please give me some information to help me, and you can close this issue directly.
If you are interested in this scenario, I can provide Logto instance and Answer instance for your investigation.

In my opinion, there is a difference between OIDC and OAuth2. OAuth2 is called directly with a `code`, while OIDC needs to get an `Id Token` additionally, so it is most likely an incompatibility issue. Perhaps a separate OIDC plugin is needed to support this. Above is just my thoughts.

Steps to reproduce:

Go to the issues page.
Apply two different labels to filter the issues (for example, label A and label B).

Expected behavior: Issues should only appear once, even if they match both labels.

Actual behavior: Issues that match both labels are duplicated in the result list.

The problem is solved. After the server starts, it should access the front-end started service and enter the configuration page through the /install route, rather than access the service directly on the server side

@chenyong0923 That's kind of weird. But you can try using the official image first. `docker pull apache/answer:latest`. If there is no problem, then there must be something wrong with the docker build process. Because the official image is built from the `dockerfile` in the code repository.

It's normal to pull the official image directly from the Docker Hub, and cloning the official source code and building the image also results in a loading status. I will try it on another computer.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc6SZP7B/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I tested it, and it is indeed like this. It should be related to the adjustment of the routing logic of the last load of the socket. The number of interfaces allowed to be accessed when ignoring /install is limited, so there is a problem here during initialization.

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe

We use a cloud-hosted Answer instance. It's common that some possible users do not even know the app and use another channel to ask something, like an issue in a project, for example, or just think something is a bug while it's not. We need a quick way to do a soft move, without forcing the user to rewrite everything.

## Describe the solution you'd like

I think best experience for user would be having an admin endpoint to create the question as another user. So we can use it in workflows. It's already possible to have a user to create the question using the API, but it should be the asking user because he'll choose the right answer.

## Describe alternatives you've considered

A simpler feature may be fill the new question form with query parameters, like ""http://my-instance/questions/ask?title=Test%20Title&description=My%20%test%description&tags=mytag1,mytag2. This is a good feature in GitLab and GitHub while opening issues.

When trying to add a user from the admin panel, there is a length restriction that prevents usernames shorter than 4 characters from being accepted. This restriction was removed in #1127.

### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the admin panel.
2. Attempt to add a user with a username that is fewer than 4 characters long.
3. See the error message preventing the addition of the user due to length restrictions.

### Expected behavior
I expected to be able to add a user with a username shorter than 4 characters, as the restriction was removed in #1127.

Problem:
Using pgbouncer's transaction mode (port 6543) instead of session mode causes critical issues:

Parameter Binding Error

Error message ""bind message supplies 4 parameters, but prepared statement requires 1"" typically occurs when pgbouncer creates new connections for each query. 

This breaks XORM's parameter binding mechanism, causing a mismatch in the number of parameters expected by the query statement. (It seems session states are being used and lost.)

Example error:

> bind message supplies 4 parameters, but prepared statement requires 1

For the Query: ""SELECT \""id\"", \""created_at\"", \""updated_at\"", \""user_id\"", \""invite_user_id\"", \""last_edit_user_id\"", \""title\"", \""original_text\"", \""parsed_text\"", \""pin\"", \""show\"", \""status\"", \""view_count\"", \""unique_view_count\"", \""vote_count\"", \""answer_count\"", \""hot_score\"", \""collection_count\"", \""follow_count\"", \""accepted_answer_id\"", \""last_answer_id\"", \""post_update_time\"", \""revision_id\"" FROM \""question\"" WHERE \""question\"".\""status\"" IN ($1,$2) AND (question.show = $3) AND (question.created_at > $4) ORDER BY question.pin desc,question.hot_score DESC LIMIT 6""

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. With a brand new system being set up with an transaction mode postgresdb, you can get the error everytime.

### Expected behavior

5xx error report

After deleting the user permanently, some user's configuration is still kept. Although this part doesn't create bugs or cause display errors, which is why we forgot it, maybe removing them would be better. What do you think?

For example,

- `notification` and `user_notification_config` contain the user's notification and configuration.
- `plugin_user_config` contains the user's configuration of the plugin

Please describe

During plugin development, we frequently need persistent data storage capabilities. The current plugin system only supports reading user configurations, which severely limits plugin functionality. For example, when developing Passkey login features, plugins need to store client public key information, but the existing architecture cannot support this requirement.

## Describe the solution you'd like

I propose adding a new plugin type called KVStorage to provide key-value storage capabilities for plugins. Here is the specific design:

```go
// util
type PluginKVStorage struct {
    Get(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error)
    Set(ctx context.Context, key, value string) error
    Del(ctx context.Context, key string) error
    Tx(ctx context.Context, call func(ctx context.Context)) error
}

// entity
type KVStorage struct{
    ID             string `xorm:""not null pk BIGINT(20) id""`
    PluginSlugName string `xorm:""not null VARCHAR(128) plugin_slug_name""`
    Status         int    `xorm:""not null default 1 INT(11) status""`
    Key            string `xorm:""not null VARCHAR(255) key""`
    Value          string `xorm:""not null MEDIUMTEXT value""`
}

// plugin
type KVStorage interface {
    // Inject PluginKVStorage
    InjectKVStorage func(kvs *PluginKVStorage)
}
```

This design ensures data isolation through the PluginSlugName field, where each plugin can only access its own data. It also provides transaction support to ensure atomic data operations.

## Describe alternatives you've considered

1. Direct Database Access: We considered allowing plugins to access the database directly, but this approach poses serious security risks. Direct database access would break system encapsulation and make it difficult to manage permissions and ensure data security.
2. File System Storage: We considered letting plugins use the file system for data storage, but this approach would make unified management difficult and increase operational complexity and management costs.

Let's add some more details.

1. Let's add details on how `status` is used. Is it for deletion? Or is it for other identification purposes?
2. `Tx` is a good design, but this one seems to be more difficult to implement. I don't have a good idea of how to implement it elegantly. Perhaps you might describe it more. I would consider this feature an enhancement, not a required item.
3. Do you think we need to add a group concept and range query? As the plugin's data may hold data under different features. Under the current design, we can differentiate by key.

key=value

```
login_abc(userid)=123
feat_ced(userid)=456
```

Importing the concept of groups is actually

```
key=abc; group=login; value=123
key=ced; group=feat; value=456
```

In this way, perhaps we can give the plugin the ability to page through the data under a group.

Of course I would consider this an enhancement as well. Maybe for cases where the plugin has a scheduled task to scan all the existing data for processing.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc6YpKAV/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks for your valuable feedback! Let me address each point:

1. Regarding the status field:
In my current design, data is restored when updating if records with the same group and key exist. Do you think direct deletion would be a better approach? Looking forward to your feedback on this design choice.
2. About transaction support:
I've implemented a simple transaction mechanism that leverages xorm's session. Here's how it works:
```go
type PluginKVStorage struct {
	db             *xorm.Engine
	session        *xorm.Session
	pluginSlugName string
}
// ...
func (kv * PluginKVStorage) Tx(ctx context.Context, fn func(ctx context.Context, kv KVOperator) error) error {
	if kv.session != nil {
		return fn(ctx, *kv)
	}

	session := kv.db.NewSession()
	defer session.Close()
	err := fn(ctx, KVOperator{
		session:        session,
		db:             kv.db,
		pluginSlugName: kv.pluginSlugName,
	})
	if err != nil {
		session.Rollback()
		return err
	}
	return session.Commit()
}

2. Aha. Because there is only one context in the original design, I find it difficult to implement.`Tx(ctx context.Context, call func(ctx context.Context)) error`

BTW, you need to call `Begin()` first.

```go
	session := engine.NewSession()
	defer session.Close()

	// call begin
	if err := session.Begin(); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// TODO

	if err := session.Commit(); err != nil {
		return result, err

We are using Apache Answer in our company. In the first version, we translated everything to Portuguese and it worked. With the new version 1.4.1, I'm having a problem with badges. On the admin page, the translation works. However, on the user page, the translation doesn't work. I checked the database and it gets data from the YAML file, but it appears to use the US English version. What do I need to do?

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to 'Badges' in the user page.
2. See error

### Expected behavior

The user badges page should use the pt_BR.yaml file

Please describe

The code blocks on the Answer site do not support copying now. When I try to select all using Ctrl+A, the entire HTML will be selected, and I cannot select only the content of the code blocks. This results in users having to manually hover over the text of the code block with the mouse and then copy it, causing inconvenience to the user if they want to copy the content of the code block.

## Describe the solution you'd like

It would be even better if a copy button could be added to the code block. 

## Describe alternatives you've considered

If there is a plugin that can do this, please let me know. Thank you

While building the UI using the `make ui` command, the following sequence of commands is run:

```
@cd ui && pnpm pre-install && pnpm build && cd -
```


During development, we ran into an issue where linting was not done consistently. Specifically, I ran `npm run lint`, but other developers didn't, which made it harder to find and fix the issue, especially with [Issue #1217](#1217).

## Suggested Solution

To improve consistency and avoid future confusion, we should add the `npm run lint` step to the `make ui` process. This will ensure linting is always run as part of the build process.

### Proposed Update:
```makefile
ui:
    @cd ui && pnpm pre-install && pnpm build && npm run lint && cd -
```

This ensures that linting is always performed after building the UI, maintaining consistent code quality across all developers.

## Alternatives Considered

- **CI/CD Pipeline Linting**: Ensure linting is mandatory in the CI/CD pipeline to catch any linting issues before deployment.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use pre-commit hooks (e.g., Husky) to enforce linting before every commit, ensuring developers don’t forget to lint locally.

## Impact

Adding this change will:
- Ensure consistent linting across all developers.
- Prevent hard-to-find bugs related to inconsistent code quality.

I understand that linting in the build phase may not be as useful since the build product is compressed.

However, adding linting to the build process ensures it's always run, even if developers forget to do it manually. I agree that Husky pre-commit linting is a good approach. Another idea could be to apply linting in the npm run start command, so it's automatically run during development without relying on developers to remember it.

You can first withdraw this solution from the previous PR and submit a separate PR, so that it will not affect the submission of the previous PR.

I need to think again about how to add lint verification scheme when submitting code, because the method you mentioned above is not a standard solution, or see if other people in the community have better methods.

You can configure the `User Email JSON Path` and `Check Email Verified` to solve it. For example, if you are using the `Google OAuth`, you can set the `Check Email Verified` to `email_verified`. After that, when the user login from Google, if Google returns the `email_verified=true` means this user's email does not need to be active again.

Please describe

When installing this program, I sometimes accidentally hit wrong keys and enter incorrect passwords. During the installation process, there is no secondary password verification, nor is there an eye icon (👀) that can be clicked to view and confirm the initial password. As a result, if an incorrect password is entered, it becomes impossible to log into the system and the only solution is to reinstall the application.

## Describe the solution you'd like

Add an eye icon or add a second password input field for password confirmation, and check/validate this password.

For now, I haven't thought of any other solutions.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/1235,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/1235,answer,2807377437,1235,Building plugins with docker results in a successful build with no plugins installed,bendemeyer,3671234,Ben DeMeyer,,CLOSED,2025-01-23T16:32:14Z,2025-01-31T20:17:15Z,"I'm not sure if this issue is more appropriate here or in `answer-plugins`, since it relates to plugins but seems like it might be an issue with `answer build` generally. Anyway, I'm putting it in both and I can delete one if it's in the wrong place.

I'm trying to get answer running with some plugins, using the docker build process described here: https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins/#docker-build

When I do this the `answer build` step completes successfully, but when I run `answer plugin` with the new binary I get an empty output. If I run the server and access the admin area, it shows no plugins are installed.

To troubleshoot, I set up a builder image with this basic Dockerfile:
```
FROM apache/answer AS answer-source

FROM golang:1.22-alpine AS golang-builder

COPY --from=answer-source /usr/bin/answer /usr/bin/answer

RUN apk --no-cache add build-base git bash nodejs npm go
RUN npm install -g pnpm@8.9.2
```

And within that I run
```
answer build --with github.com/apache/answer-plugins/render-markdown-codehighlight --output /usr/bin/answer_new
```

That process runs, compiles, and appears to complete successfully. However, the plugins aren't actually installed in the output binary.
```
/go # answer_new plugin
/go # 
```

I can also see that the newly built binary is a little smaller than the original:
```
/usr/bin # ls -lah | grep answer
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root       74.3M Nov 22 06:56 answer
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root       68.5M Jan 23 15:05 answer_new
```

I'm running this on an M1 mac, and I've replicated this result in both arm & amd64 container architectures. I've also tried upgrading the build container to the latest version of `pnpm` to see if that made a difference, and it did not.

This is the (mostly) complete console output I get when I run `answer build`, with some of the big-long-lists-of-things truncated for the sake of making it more readable:

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { ""buffer"": require.resolve(""buffer/"") }'
	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { ""buffer"": false }

There are two possible solutions: if version 1.4.1 is being used, then lower-version plugins must be specified. If the latest version 1.4.2 is being used, the latest version plugins can be utilized.

Use the latest version to build. For docker

```dockerfile

If you want to use the old version, you need to choose the plugin's old version specifically and use the old repo name (incubator-answer-plugins).

One of the goals I'm aiming for in the way I set up my instance is to minimize long-term maintenance overhead, including things like explicit version management. Ideally I'd like to be able to update to the latest release just by re-running the build with my existing Dockerfile.

Do you think it would be possible to establish a versioning/tagging pattern between the `apache/answer` and `apache/answer-plugin` projects that would guarantee (or at least as close to that as is possible in software) compatibility between dynamically referenced objects? Maybe something like `@stable` and `@latest` tags?

I don't know much about these projects yet, so I'm not sure how much overhead would go into implementing & maintaining something like that. If it's doable, I'd be happy to contribute if I can get some pointers on where to start.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc6bvmRw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In a golang-builder container based on the `apache/answer:1.4.2-RC2` image, when I tried to run this build command:
```
answer build --with github.com/apache/answer-plugins/render-markdown-codehighlight --output /usr/bin/answer_new
```

It errored with the following result:
```

        module declares its path as: github.com/apache/incubator-answer
                but was required as: github.com/apache/answer
```

I noticed it was still trying to pull `answer@v1.4.1` as its starting point and figured that was the cause of the problem. I found this comment in the build script which suggests this is probably expected behavior since 1.4.2 hasn't actually been released yet:
> // If user specify a module replacement, use it. Otherwise, use the latest version.

I was then able to specify a module replacement using the `ANSWER_MODULE` environment variable, and that ultimately did the trick. I updated my Dockerfile like so and it works now:
```
FROM apache/answer:1.4.2-RC2 AS answer-source

FROM golang:1.22-alpine AS golang-builder

ENV ANSWER_MODULE=""github.com/apache/answer@v1.4.2-RC2""

The issue is due to a recent repository name change. The name was `incubator-answer` modified to `answer` since the project had not graduated. Thank you for your efforts and we apologize for the unnecessary trouble this issue has caused you. After the name is confirmed, this problem will not occur again.

For plugins, we support specifying the latest version of the plugin. For example:
`github.com/apache/answer-plugins/render-markdown-codehighlight@latest`

Then for you to mention establishing a correlation about the version between the two is a good idea. Maybe in the plugin, we can set a minimum version of `Answer` to be supported. Because usually, higher versions are compatible with lower versions. This part needs to be considered more. 🤔

Something like this seems like a great idea to me! If the plugin ""releases"" can hold metadata about which versions of core `answer` they support, then the `answer build` process could potentially account for that, and install the latest version of each requested plugin that's compatible with whichever version of `answer` that's being built.

Another possible change that occurred to me is about the default version of `answer` that gets built if `ANSWER_MODULE` isn't defined. Would it make more sense to have it default to the same version as the current binary, as opposed to the latest release? The advantage to that change would be simplifying the docker build process, as whichever container you start with is the one you'll build. The biggest disadvantage I see is that it would make upgrading an existing installation in-place a little more complicated.

After poking around in the build code, I think I have a pretty good idea of how that second change might be implemented. If it would be desirable, I can test it out and open a PR.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/answer/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIFx7Hc6b7zYV/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I catch two minor issues (maybe they are not issues) when I try to run source code in my local environment for the first time,
If you accept them as bug or enhancement, I would create a pr.

## First

```shell
 $ make ui
```
is failing with this error `pnpm: command not found`.

```shell
$ make install-ui-packages
```
should run before.

My recommendation is:
- Simply revise readme file like;
```shell
 $ make install-ui-packages
 $ make ui
```
**or** 

change the make command like;
```
 ui: install-ui-packages
     @cd ui && pnpm pre-install && pnpm build && cd -
```
## Second
I was playing with some functionalities then I noticed there was no message for 'old_pass'.
