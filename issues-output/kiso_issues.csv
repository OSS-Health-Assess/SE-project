I2C Write register sequence can be as the following:
|start|slaveAddress+RWbit|SlaveAcknowledge|RegisterAddress|SlaveAcknowledge|registerData|stop|
This scenario handles Register Address as the first element of the data buffer to be sent which is fine. 
Some I2C device Manufacturers (e.g. BST ) provide drivers that expect the user to provide functions to readRegister(slaveAddress, Register, data, length)  writeRegister(SlaveAddress, register, data, length) which is BTW not standard I2C. This has the consequence that we should  recompose the sending operation in order to prepend the register address and send it before the data to be written.
In STM32 Library this is not easy because there is no way the library provides which allows you to select which start/termination for the data you are going to send.

in essentials we have the APIs MCU_I2C_ReadRegister() and  MCU_I2C_WriteRegister() which have been implemented in STM32 for polling mode, for interrupt mode (with some active waiting for register address transmission), and not for DMA mode because no way to do it other than not using STM32Cube library and writing owns IRQ handlers.

@khalifima I removed your newly created label for now. I don't see a need for this additional type right now (maybe later). Also, I only see a single issue labeled with it. That one, or this one here, respectively, I would label as a missing feature, i.e., ""Type: Feature"". And, if we add such a new structure element it should be also inherited in the corresponding structure and orga documentation. For now, let's stick to the existing structure and sync in person about the need of additional elements.

Reasons:
* unittest failing on linux 64bit machine due to misalignments in the current implementation.
* -> Basically the module has a dependency on the type of machines --> Issue for compatibilities

Todo:
* ~Use instead the stream-buffer of freeRTOS to fulfil the same needs.~
* Refactoring discussed with @ChiefGokhlayehBosch to fit the Cellular requirements. See picture

Define and agree on integration test framework e.g.

==> essentials\test\integration\specs
==> ref HW (board) integration test spec not defined, yet
==> Jenkins not defined, yet
- [x] Reuse existing integration test framework --> as a start (due to critical project status right now)
==> https://github.com/eclipse/kiso/pull/105

- [x] Make integration testing public or not? --> yes, see G1 slides ""Whats part of CDDK open source""

Info: strong interest of AWS on that vs. benefit for other Bosch parties (e.g. PS with OEMs) to re-use and run own integration tests.

Currently we rely on a rather workaround in order to handle non-AT conform responses from the modem.
The responses from a modem can usually be categorized into three groups:
1. Purely AT - Meaning only ASCII characters and following the general AT formatting.
2. Mixed AT & binary - The response may start off as clean AT but some parameter may contain binary data which is not conformal to the AT standard. This typically applies to vendor specific data-service features like on-chip UDP, TCP or HTTP stacks.
3. Purely binary - Usually declared by the `CONNECT` response. In this mode no AT commands are interpreted. Can be used to directly link the serial interface with some data-stream (like a socket, PPP-context, or even a phone call). 

Category _1_ is fully supported and should not cause any issues in the future.
Category _2_ is how we currently handle HTTP data. It is supported via the workaround, but thinking further we may run into trouble with other modem vendors/AT interfaces.
Category _3_ only makes sense for mux'ed interfaces. (ref:  3GPP TS 27.010). This may be neat to have in the future. It gets rid of the need for payload-escaping and should generally be lower latency/higher throughput. However, a lot of code needs to be written to support this feature (parsers, virtual channel handlers, bootstrapping code).

To properly fix cat. 2 responses we need an architectural change in the way we handle modem responses. Currently _parsing the response_ and _interpreting it_ are temporally disconnected. Meaning the interpretation is deferred onto a later point in time, possibly after the data already went fully through the parsing stage. This disconnect prevents us from intervening the parsing stage and telling it ""hey, what follows now isn't actually AT, so don't bother..."".

**Proposal A:**
Remove the temporal disconnect. Make the parsing ad-hoc, as needed by the interpreter. Probably a bigger change, but would be the most reliable.

**Proposal B:**
Make it possible to register a ""exit-AT-condition"". Such a condition could be the command string of the response. Once the exit-condition is encountered in the response-stream, we switch to an alternative parser. Once done with the out-of-AT contents we return to the default parser. Less work, but also less reliable.

@bierkandt-bosch input needed on timeline planning. I don't think this task is essential for the ICD, but must be handled eventually. Adding support for other modem vendors may be blocked by this issue.

I noticed a potential hazard in the HTTP service-layer.
The Cellular driver API promises to be thread-safe. To achieve this we simply lock the entire driver API with a mutex. We do this via the helper function `Engine_Dispatch()`. The idea is to put everything that should be under the mutex' protection into a function and then dispatch said function via this little helper. Note that in-between consecutive `Engine_Dispatch()` calls we are not protected.
This is what's bugging me about `HttpService.c`. There we call `Engine_Dispatch()` multiple times for a single request. Given that HTTP works with intermediate files on the modem's own flash, it is highly recommended to protect the entire request under a single mutex lock (basically just get rid of the individual `Engine_Dispatch()` calls and stuff everything into a single one).

@holgerjung The current stm32cube driver doesn't support for the board variant STM32L4R5XX variant . 
The third party stm32cube needs to be Updated https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeL4
my understanding is STM32CubeL4 will be a separate folder like STM32cube instead of update the existing STM32cube  . so shall we update add these files into the third party folder or someone kiso team will Update . kindly clarify. Thanks

As this seems to be a limitation is STMs DMA implementation, best way we should work around this is to do multiple transfers of <=64KiB blocks until we have transferred the requested amount of data.

Looking at the current Cellular coverage we see the following issues:
- Many modules are completely untested (i.e. 0% coverage). Due to a limitation of `lcov` these offenders don't even show up in the report. Note: we should look into other modules if that's the case too. One way to do this would be via a ""baseline"" unit-test, which only compiles the CuT and runs a dummy test-fixture (the important bit is that it includes the source file and is executed during `ctest`) 
  - [x] Make untested modules show up in coverage report.
  - [ ] Apply the same baseline'ing for other modules from other packages.
- The existing ""emulator"" tests cover basic AT response parsing and interpreting. Adding more AT varied AT responses would improve corner-case coverage.
  - [ ] Extend existing emulator tests by more AT responses, focusing on corner-cases (i.e. an invalid parameter in an otherwise valid response)
- Formerly known as `BCDS_Queue`, the `Queue` is now part of Cellular and has 0% coverage. Special care must be taken due to the ""flexible array member"" C language feature, which is not supported in C++. This results in ""off-by-one-byte"" memory corruptions, due to padding being introduced into the structure by the unknowing C++ compiler. Perhaps add `__attribute__((packed))`, to prohibit padding being added by the C++ compiler.
  - [ ] Find a way of compiling and testing `Queue` (formerly `BCDS_Queue`) in C++ environment.
  - [ ] Add unit-tests to `Queue`
- Many of the currently untested modules handle the glue-code between AT command IO and the public API of Cellular. Their behaviour usually just consists of converting data from the ublox-specific AT representation to the unified Cellular data-structures.
  - [ ] Add tests to glue-code modules `ublox/Network`, `ublox/Power`, `ublox/HttpService`, `ublox/SocketService`, `ublox/DnsService`.

Backlog grooming:
- 70% coverage is reached and was approved by project review board
  - is not yet on master and visible on jenkins
  - Mohammed will open PR accordingly
  - once merged this ticket shall be closed
- Still there are open issues (e.g. for reaching more coverage the unit test approach must be changed) => separate ticket #350

Function `CellularHttp_GetResponse()` found in https://github.com/Bosch-AE-SW/cddk-oss/blob/e8f6f497a52495617ddb0e09043840abbfb1cb8f/core/connectivity/cellular/include/Kiso_CellularHttpService.h#L113 fails and results in undefined behaviour if the user does not provide a sufficiently sized data buffer to hold the full HTTP response. This is a currently undocumented limitation of the implementation and should at least be made visible to the user.

Example: A user performs a GET request on some large web-resource (like a firmware-image). The image is 1MB in size. The modem performs the download, stores the file on its internal flash memory and notifies the user. The user consequently wants to read the response, but can't provide the 1MB required for a single read. They instead perform a read with 10KB expecting the file download to automatically offset with each read. The function does not compare the required and provided buffer sizes nor does it offset the read-start-address after each read. So it proceeds to download 10KB, over and over again. Best-case result, the user reads the same 10KB each time and has invalid data. Worst-case result, the AT IO-handling gets tripped up by the unfinished download and subsequent AT IO fails, requiring a hard-reset.

The API does currently not state whether or not multiple reads on a single response are allowed. On ublox modems, this is just a download of a file on the modem-internal flash. So reading small chunks from a HTTP response is supported. Quectel supports a similar mode-of-operation via `AT+QHTTPREADFILE`.
 - [ ] Decide if a HTTP response can be streamed, rather than consumed whole. Design, document and implement accordingly.

This ties into the already very limited support for HTTP in the current AT IO-handling (see #197; should be figured out first!)

According to [DockerHub Pricing](https://hub.docker.com/pricing) for organizations there is no free tier.
We could setup a free individual account to hold the repository with the image, but we would need to share the account (of course bad idea) and it probably clashes with docker hub's usage policies.

@bierkandt-bosch, do you know who we can contact to see if there is already a Bosch organization in docker hub, how we can get a new team in it, if there is one, and make a repository?

I label this as ""Prio: Minor"" because I believe this issue is 1:1 related to RefHW BOsch IVAS which is not a prio scope for Kiso. As of now, we shall focus on publicly available HW as the Nucleo dev kit that the basis for IVAS. And, not sure if we want to to have the IVAS code completely open source -> this is a project team decision, not Kiso.

I'm working on moving the issues and the other project details. There a nice Python project available for this: https://github.com/IQAndreas/github-issues-import
`python3 gh-issues-import.py --config config.ini --all --ignore-milestone`

Unfortunately, with this, the closed issues will be created new (with a [CLOSED] prefix) and remain open. Thus, I'm looking into transferring only the open issues and stripping the closed issues.

And, the milestone won't be transferred at all. So, I'll be recreating them in the public repo.

Projects using Kiso would probably have their own build system. Nevertheless, building an application on Kiso does not mean I need to integrate my application to Kiso.
Therefore the following parameters need to be added:
* KISO_APPLICATION_PATH allowing a project to link an external application to build with Kiso
* KISO_CONFIGURATION_PATH allowing a project to link an external configuration to use to build the Kiso packages/libs
* KISO_BOARD_PATH allowing a project to link an external board to use to build the Kiso HAL

As default:
* KISO_APPLICATION_PATH set to examples/${KISO_BOARD_NAME}/
* KISO_BOARD_PATH set to boards/${KISO_BOARD_NAME}/
* KISO_CONFIGURATION_PATH boards/${KISO_BOARD_NAME}/config

The ticket title and the description are a bit misleading. Here we are talking about building applications and BSPs from different locations then the Kiso examples folder. 

If we want to treat Kiso as 3rd party library we would need to have build target for kiso which would build everything except application and BSP, put it in a 3rd party lib -> have a libkiso.a afterwards

How would someone add its own third party libs to the project, that are not in the Kiso 3rd Party folder? Shall he add those in his fork or shall we provide also a mechanism for the user to specify his own library folder?

For the XDK110 Joachim has designed an extension with the BG96 module.

This could proof the extensibility of the cellular module. 
There is also a customer in the pipe which would use this module.

What else there is to improve documentation?
- [x] Define documentation strategy (what goes in .md files, what on hugo, what in Hugo server, what in doxygen, is there a wiki somewhere) --> see project review board #4 slides (Documentation)
- [ ] Restructure doxygen (e.g. in essentials first docu from .h then from .c might confuse user)
  - [x] create examples section
  - [x] write proper documentation for each example (e.g purpose of the example, HW ressources needed, how to build it and flash it)in the @details section
  - [x] create boards section
  - [ ] write proper documentation for each board (e.g. Introduce the board, the MCU, the 
peripherals supported, those not supported, where to buy etc.)
  - [ ] write documentation for example c-cellular

FYI, I setup a Hugo server: [kiso.rempler.de:1313](kiso.rempler.de:1313)
It's an Azure Ubuntu VM with a cronjob that pulls the Kiso repo every 5min. I propose to use that server temporary until we have the Eclipse Foundation setup ready. Thus, all links in our docu can point there instead of leading to nowhere.

----

XProtocol_EncodeFrame() and XProtocol_DecodeFrame() currently have hidden limitation (not handled at all) for dataLength because of param type of CRC_16(). However it looks like CRC_16() can be called in loop over bigger buffer with smaller chunks.
Must be checked again.

Additional findings with XProtocol:
1. XProtocol_IsCompleteFrame() param lastCheckPosition is useless and can be removed.
2. Will be good to have mechanism (function) to calculate required length for encoded buffer.

the latest version of freertos does not follow the pattern previously used for portable and introduces new hierarchical levels (eg secure, non_secure) and new sources. therefore there is need to redefine how our compilation targets the freertos library.

In order RetCode and Logging subsystems to work properly, every module (i.e., each build unit) should define proper MODULE_ID macros. In addition, values assigned to each MODULE_ID must be unique for entire system.
Currently we have modules which do not define this macros. Also values defined in BSP_CommonGateway_Modules_E, KISO_Essentials_ModuleID_E, KISO_CELLULAR_ModuleID_E, App_ModuleID_E and possibly others overlap.

Please note, Module IDs were designed to be unique only _within_ their package (i.e. Cellular, Essentials, Utils, etc.). To differentiate Retcodes with the same Module ID but coming from different packages we declare a `KISO_PACKAGE_ID` during compilation. Currently this seems to be hard-coded to 0 for **every** package (which is not intended). Either revisit the idea of what a _package_ is, or properly set the package ID as intended by the Retcode system.

One side-note perhaps, in the past we only set `KISO_PACKAGE_ID` as compile time define. The value could never be retrieved during runtime as no symbol was attributed to it. Using CMakes `configure_file` function, we could define the value once in the build-system and then transfer it over to some `const int CellularPackageId = ...` during compilation. The specifics of this still need to be figured out though.

What is making you to believe ModuleID should be unique per subsystem and not globally? What is making you to assume what is its intend in regards to Retcode system?
However, there are limitations in other subsystems, which can convince me to change PackageID and leave ModuleID as is. PackageID and ModuleID are intended to work in tandem, and resulting tuple of those 2 must be unique.
Any way, at present we don't use both of them correctly. 

KISO_PACKAGE_ID can be retrieved at any time because it is available at compile time AND at runtime as constant. CMakes configure_file() is not needed for this, also separate (global) const variable is not needed. If you know the name of such (global) cont, you will know the name of the macros too.

> What is making you to believe ModuleID should be unique per subsystem and not globally?

It's how we originally designed it, back when the project was was still called ""CoSP"". And this how it is used in XDK derivative of CoSP to this day. True, documentation is missing in-code, that's because we used to document package IDs and the internals of the Retcode system outside of the code-base (similar to how we do with Hugo right now). There's also a practical limitation: Module IDs only allocated one byte of the 4 byte Retcode bitfield, meaning one can only ever have 255 (2⁸-1 because 0 is reserved) unique modules.
Note that I'm not arguing for or against a unique package ID, I just wanted to point out, that we used to view module IDs only unique within their package (as you said, the tuple must be unique).

This is what I found in the code-base:
https://github.com/Bosch-AE-SW/cddk-oss/blob/ed65070f68fa8271ccb6f1f8ae6b8c52d60ddaf2/core/essentials/include/Kiso_Retcode.h#L229-L233

If you argue that package IDs are superseded due to how the repo is structured **right now**, ok! Let's bring this to the attention of all architects. If we scrap the idea of packages, we should also remove their allocation in the 32 bit Retcode bitfield and perhaps expand the module ID bitmask.

> KISO_PACKAGE_ID can be retrieved at any time because it is available at compile time AND at runtime as constant.

I think you misunderstood me. Here's what I meant:

Say we implement a centralized error handler for any non-caught Retcode in our Kiso-enabled App (anything raised through `Retcode_RaiseError()` or `Retcode_RaiseErrorFromIsr()`). In this error handler we want to identify which package the Retcode came from. Simple enough right? You can retrieve the package ID from the Retcode via `Retcode_getPackage()`, wonderful! Now what do you compare it against... `KISO_PACKAGE_ID`? No, that would be the package ID of your current package. The one **you are in** right now. How do we obtain the numerical value of the package ID for Cellular? ... Do you see the problem? There is no `KISO_PACKAGE_ID_CELLULAR` defined anywhere! `KISO_PACKAGE_ID` is always populated with the value of your current package. You can not use it to obtain the package IDs of other packages.

You and problems i faced in code (not only retcode bitmask) convinced me to keep ModuleID unique only under its containing package. That means i fill try to define PackageID somehow in order to get unique tuples.
ModuleID is 'reserved' as fallback for non compliant modules. I will try to remove this too. NOTE: incorrectly structured files, which first include Retcode.h and after that define ModuleID are just bad formatted ones and does not belong to non compliant ones.

Out of the topic: 
Usage example you quoted, defining constraints on PackageID and ModuleID, is located at lines 230-233. Will move this example to top file header, thanks for pointing it out.
Retcode_RaiseError() or Retcode_RaiseErrorFromIsr() does not enforce in any way that PackageID/ModuleID will be set. Retcode_RaiseError(RETCODE_FAILURE) is perfectly fine. From other side, some can freely return RETCODE(RETCODE_SEVERITY_NONE, RETCODE_SUCCESS) and it will be different from RETCODE_SUCCESS. Yet another example is return RETCODE_FAILURE;

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The Cellular SW module has been broken during unit testing improvement and nobody realized this. Only after manual setup for the BoCSE demo this has been noticed.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
We must have an automated (continuous integration) setup to know the health status of our master branch. This setup needs to be
* Prio a) working with Bosch infrastructure
* Prio b) extendable with additional reference HW
* Prio c) working with future Eclipse Foundation infratructure

- [ ] First Kiso RefHW Bosch CommonGateway connected to Jenkins agent (Beaglebone) for flashing and executing integration tests
- [ ] write integration test spec
  cddk-oss/boards/CommonGateway/test/specs
  e.g., read out MCU id
  e.g., read out BMA350 id
  e.g., read out Ublox SARA IMEI
- [ ] run integration tests on the HW
  cddk-oss/boards/CommonGateway/test/integration
- [ ] integration test results visible to [Kiso Jenkins](https://rb-jmaas.de.bosch.com/software-campus/view/Kiso-Dashboard/)
- [ ] Hugo documentation update

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We have already a CI setup for unit tests etc.. The Ku server and the Beaglebones are prepared for XDK integration tests.

I had an interesting discussion today at the BoCSE about how we could have our Jenkins dashboard, i.e., the CI results public available.
If we connect the Beaglebones to the development network (which I think they maybe already are) using the white router boxes (transparent proxy) they could open up (and keep it open) a ssh tunnel - maybe during startup - to a Jenkins master outside BGN. I can offer to support with a Azure VM until we have the EF infrastructure and their Jenkins master available. On the VM we could quickly install and run a Jenkins instance to try out the connection to our Bosch development Beaglebones.

""interface"" is not accurate in this PR. If you care about wording, it can be changed.
it is an implentation of stm32f7 version. 
the 200 more files are from stm32f7 bsp which is the one I need for now, because I do not have kiso bsp for f7.
it can be reduced to minimal, if file number is a concern. or totoally removed after kiso f7 bsp is ready.

What you need from BSP? For now i can see you use only ethernetif_init(), which, combined with low_level_init(), is around 2 screens. Later you may need other functions. May be you can extract them and put in dedicated file. If you do so, later they can be more easily translated to Kiso BSP pattern.
EDIT: ops, you reduced them while i was typing.

You work late :)
Nice catch, I also realized it should be exclude from this PR. Later when example is developed, BSP part is needed to do some board level init.

Automated metric that can be accessed via continuous integration Jenkins dashboard. The tooling to automate this can be discussed with our workplace team. Also, which measurements are to be accounted into code complexity should be defined via experience from workplace team projects.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We're (kind of) using CLang-tidy, e.g., ""Function-size"" but w/o configuring it, i.e., not activating it. This report would then show us if we're above or below our own set watermark level.

**Additional context**
This is not concerning defining the watermark or complexity level that's acceptable or not. Defining the watermark level can be taken 

- [ ] Define and document (Hugo) complexity measurements (at least one, e.g., cyclomatic complexity).
  Expected output: Hugo page that describes which complexity measures we're using.
- [ ] Automated way to analyse above.
  Expected output: complexity metrics are automatically and continuously generated for latest master branch.
- [ ] Status to be publicly visible, e.g., Jenkins dashboard
  Expected output: metric reports are accessible via browser for everbody

ST HAL SysTick must be at the highest priority, as there are Hal layers using timouts and etc.  RTOS forces the SysTick priority to be lowest. So for now best workaround will be to maybe introduce a second timer.

Amazon doesn't integrate STMCube and doesn't deal with specific problems. STM is integrating Amazon solutions. However, STM doesn't fully agree this is a bug, still providing an advice to use another timer if any RTOS is used.
https://community.st.com/s/question/0D50X00009XkhEpSAJ/cubemx-freertos-using-systick

Tickless option can be discussed when we start its implementation.

Currently the structure /examples/-=board=-/-=example name=-  generates a lot of code duplication. 
The best solution is to make examples board independent, and use Kiso_bsp layers , all enums from BSP_CommonGateway for example can go to KISO_LED_BSP and all the rest that are required.

**Suggested example structure of the examples:**
examples\c-leds
examples\c-wifi
examples\c-ethernet
examples\c-cellular
examples\c-sensors

Our Docker image uses Debian 10 as base and packages directly from the repository. To see the versions available for each package, we can use `apt policy cmake`:
```
root@e61f5e6190e8:/# apt policy cmake
cmake:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 3.13.4-1
  Version table:
     3.13.4-1 500
        500 http://deb.debian.org/debian buster/main amd64 Packages
```
There is only one option in the default configured repository in any given moment. If we specify exact version dependency for the package in the Dockerfile (for example: `RUN apt install cmake=3.13.4-1`), then a couple of days later the same Dockerfile might not build, because the upstream version is bumped to '3.13.4-3'. For us to have specific versions of tools in the docker image, we need to download them from somewhere else, manage the dependencies, etc. and I believe it's a bad idea.

Since the Docker images are versioned in the DTR, we can use this versioning from now on to verify newer packages with the tools we need and upgrade only once we are certain the new image is working as expected. Additionally we can use older base images and combinations of repos (for example in Debian stretch/oldstable cmake's package is 3.7.2) to verify we haven't broken any promises by saying ""CMake 3.7 or later"" in the docs. 

For now I'd like to add the current versions as comments in the Dockerfile, but not enforce them there, spend some time to find and verify the lowest reasonable working version of each tool we are using (gcc, arm gcc, cmake, clang-*, make, etc.) and fill it in the docs.
@HansUweRempler, @sebastianpfischer, @elbosch, @khalifima, @yongbosch what would you say?


PS: There is also an option for defining a meta-package for apt with all our dependencies that could say 'cmake between 3.7 and 3.12.8, gcc between 8.1 and 8.3' for example, but I think that's not necessary.

set the option value in .clang-tidy to '1' and fix the reported warnings in each affected component.

  cddk-oss/examples/CommonGateway/test/integration/source
  cddk-oss/examples/CommonGateway/test/integration/specs

- [ ] write document with automated test suite (not all manual tests make sense for simple auto testing)
  Expected outcome: new file
```
  TestSuite_CommonGatewayCITests.md in
  cddk-oss/examples/CommonGateway/test/integration/specs/

Either a full path or a path relative to kiso root. I don't see any benefit in having special cases for examples vs other applications or internal boards vs external. It will complicate the cmake code unnecessarily

what about this?
KISO_APPLICATION_PATH=qualified path to kiso application
KISO_APPLICATIONS_ROOT = source of application(s)
KISO_APPLICATION_NAME= name of application

KISO_APPLICATION_PATH = KISO_APPLICATIONS_ROOT/KISO_APPLICATION_NAME

by default kiso is configured as: KISO_APPLICATIONS_ROOT=./examples
KISO_APPLICATION_NAME = c-leds

so you can either specify a full path to the application, you can only define a root, and use different app names or you can just build the standard example.

Same with boards:

KISO_BOARS_ROOT
KISO_BOARD_NAME
KISO_BOARD_PATH=KISO_BOARDS_ROOT/KISO_BOARD_NAME

default: 
KISO_BOARDS_ROOT=./boards
KISO_BOARD_NAME=CommonGateway
...

so you could still build kiso like:
cmake . -Bbuild -DKISO_APPLICATION_NAME=c-cellular 
or
cmake . -Bbuild -DKISO_APPLICATION_NAME=c-sensors -DKISO_BOARD_NAME=xdk110

Solution for the code complexity, after activation of Kiso’s Clang and get warning functions which exceeds recommended size thresholds ""readability-function-size"", ex. (LineThresholds, BranchThresholds, NestingThresholds).
And create a python file to find those warning functions with their notes, by reading from the text file that has the content of the result of the output from Kiso's clang config. Then put the result in another text file.

Thanks for creating and working on this topic with own initiative. May I ask for an add-on to this task description? Yes, reporting when something is not fitting the threshold is mandatory. But, we should consider to also report the threshold setting itself. I mean, could the report contain the limits (read out from the config, not static) and show this in kind of a table form - I'm a fan of text (not HTML) tables :-).

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
we always run everything (and nothing) while running our CI jobs. Today we only do it for the code that is used with our first reference HW. That has for example the effect, that essentials is not build for stm32f7 at the moment.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Each time we touch a module, we should get a list of affected build artefacts.
e.g. we change sth. in cellular- we need to run all jobs related to this.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
always run everything for all possible configurations.

I'm unsure about the first version formatting. I want to reduce the effort to generate this changelog file - that's why it also contains some garbage info like e.g. some testing issues. Thus, I just copied over the text content that I scripted, see code snippet below. For example, the issue id I added therein will be different to the final one from the public repo (or non-existing). But, if somebody is interested in more details, he could look that up in GitHub (now that I'm typing, I should add a ""#"" prefix and a text info to indicate this).

Hugo can specify images and other artifacts in a resource file

Common practise is to build the `Dockerfile` for each job. Using tricks like
`docker pull <some_image> && docker build ... --cache-from <some_image>`, building can be sped up significantly, leading to a low penalty for building the image every time.

I propose the following naming scheme for Docker images on Docker Hub:

| Name | Examples | Purpose |
|-|-|-|
| `latest` | - | Always reflects latest master. A rolling tag getting updated with every push/merge to master. *The latest and greatest.* |
| `YY.MM` | `20.02`, `20.08`, `21.04` | Stable release following every regular Kiso release (monthly, semi-annual, whatever) |
| `stable` | points to `21.04` | Always points to the latest `YY.MM` tag. ||
| `build_X` | `build_281` | Unique build number (equivalent to Jenkins build number). These may be used **only temporary during a build**. They are used as cache between build steps, if local caching is not feasible. Docker Hub might not be the fastest registry for this purpose and their use should therefore be limited/avoided. Their average expected lifetime is 5-15 minutes. |

The procedure would run as the first build stage in the Jenkins Pipeline. Execution would occur on a Docker-out-of-Docker ([`dood`](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/blob/master/examples/dood.groovy)) container on Eclipse's Kubernetes infrastructure. Build the image using `... --cache-from kiso-build-env:latest` for performance, instantiate a container with it and if build is happening on `master`, tag it `latest` and push it to the hub.

Subsequent steps shall then be executed inside the freshly instantiated container.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/kiso/issues/141/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This means even if I update the Dockerfile, build a new tag and change the reference in the Jenkinsfile, Eclipse CI will *still* run with an old Docker image, potentially tainting the build.
