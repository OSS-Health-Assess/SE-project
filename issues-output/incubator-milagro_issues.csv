Currently the route from the main page is:
- click ""Support""
- read the Issues para, and click ""Contributing""
- scan the ""Issues"" para and click the appropriate link
- click the Issues tab

Obviously it's not possible to have a one-click link, as there are several issue trackers, but some of the stages could be eliminated.

One can go straight to ""Contributing"" from the main page, but if I am looking to report a bug, I would normally expect to find the instructions under ""Support"" rather than ""Contributing""

Might be nice to have direct link to issues section on front page
Also could link directly to issues tab on Contributing page.

Another possibility would be to have a separate Issue handling page.

""the need for a PKI infrastructure, since the main reason to issue certificates""

As it stands, the ""as"" clause is ambiguous.
