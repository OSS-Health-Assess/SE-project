I recommend to temporarily disable the 3 other failing tests (all 3 are locale-dependent):

  MonthDateFormatTest.testFormat:56 Locale=en_CA expected:<Jun[] 2013> but was:<Jun[.] 2013>
  ChartUtilTest.testFormatDouble:136 expected:<0[.]000000000> but was:<0[,]000000000>
  ChartUtilTest.testStringValue:152 expected:<...5-01-22 11:56:10.125[-08]00> but was:<...5-01-22 11:56:10.125[+01]00>

Then let's see if there are still other tests failing.
I think it's important to have green light for the build. Only then the unit tests are useful for verifying new PRs.

Totally agree. But disabling tests is not giving a good feeling ;)

Fixing these tests should be quite easy?

The failure in ChartUtilTest.testFormatDouble should indeed be easy to fix (similar to ValueFormatterTest).

The failure in ChartUtilTest.testStringValue probably cannot be fixed (unless you fly with your test machine into the expected time zone).

Regarding the other two failures which occur in the CI build (see my comment from 2h ago), I have no idea.

Alexander, can you fix them?

I think it would be quite difficult to fix all them at once, and it would be simpler to fix them one after another.

ChartUtilTest.testStringValue can be fixed by setting the default timezone in the unit test, I can make a PR for this one.

On a side note, the classes in com.ibm.icu.util.* should probably be migrated to java.util.* (Calendar, TimeZone, etc...), but this will be easier to do after all the unit tests have been fixed and a separated issue should be created to track this.

https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-p2

These can be used directly by p2 using a URL like this:

jar:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-p2/10.0.7/jetty-p2-10.0.7-p2site.zip!/

But resolution fails because
```

If I remove that dependency, it gets further, but fails like this:

A bug?

Replacing old loops and anonymous inner classes will increase readability.

There is automatic code clean-up for that. If we do reformatting, then all lines will change anyway. 

About formatting: BIRT Core is using this code style in many, but not all, places. Note the unusual placement of the brackets and the spaces between parentheses.

```

   public static String getFolderPath( final String rootPath,
            final String entryName )
    {
        if ( path.charAt( path.length( ) - 1 ) != '/' )
        {
            path = path + '/';
        }
        return path;

We should have a template, but that template is copied into every project (.settings). This prevents ppl from accidentally formatting without the template. I made a [cleanup template here](https://github.com/eclipse/birt/pull/601/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.java&file-filters%5B%5D=.xml#diff-46b2e1d4cf57ccaf5619a1d5bee8566c635f5c5dd575cb7089fea036414a9054).

We can also skip the cleanup for now and worry about that later. Only move to JDK 8. Maybe I am biting off too much for this moment.

I was personally frustrated with `mvn clean package` or `mvn clean install` failing with the current code base, and it is necessary to do `mvn install` first. I think this may put off some devs as it makes the project appear unstable.

I found that it is because the clean phase invokes maven-antrun-plugin, but this plugin requires the resolution of all the dependencies, while the maven-clean-plugin does not require the resolution of any dependencies. Additionally, generated files should be placed in /target, which will be automatically removed by the maven-clean-plugin, and the generated files are currently not in /target but caught by .gitignore, so these executions of the maven-antrun-plugin are not necessary.

I can make a PR for this, please tell me if you are interested, but the hardest part was understanding why `mvn clean` was failing on an empty project. Once this is understood, the steps are the following:

- [required] Grep for <phase>clean</phase> and remove any invocation of maven-antrun-plugin that comes up
- [optional] Remove all clean targets in build.xml, which are now dead code
- [optional] Update the paths of generated files to go in /target and cleanup .gitignore

With these changes, I have a working `mvn clean package` dev cycle that does not require the installation of the snapshot version in the local repository.

I am asking because maybe you want to finish some other tasks before accepting contributions, if so, you can integrate these changes in a PR of your own.

Cheers.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTgxMjUzNA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Please let us know if you want to help the project out.

Steve, I have created a new build. When I installed BIRT into this build, I could not start the viewer either. However, I could install the all-in-one rcp client and there it worked fine (I have one for windows only ATM).

In order to install from the latest build, use this update site:
https://download.eclipse.org/birt/update-site/4.9/

You can try to install this into a 4.19 but it was built [against 4.11 (2018-12)](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2018-12/r)

Please try these and report back at your convenience.

This has the following drawbacks:

1. When we build against a given target (e.g. 4.11), we also consume jetty from that target
2. When we install BIRT into a newer target (e.g. 4.19) old jetty bits may get included.

This was causing the viewer to break when installing 4.9 (from Mar 17 2021) into 4.19. 

The BIRT feature **_included_** the `o.e.jetty.osgi.boot` bundle which clashed with newer jetty versions. This inclusion was removed with commit 161d153

To install the viewer correctly the jetty 9.x update site must be added to the available update sites.

Were there any bug tickets related to this? If not, my guess is that it was
to be compatible with their commercial products. Seems to me that decoding
and re-encoding is a bit of overkill.

The XSS problem is caused by the format parameter being inserted directly into the HTML in Attributes.jsp.  The problem doesn't appear to affect any other parameter.  So the best solution is to just use the htmlEncode function to encode the format parameter in Attributes.jsp.  The htmlEncode function is already used many other places in the jsp's so I think this was just an oversight.  

I have forked the repo and am ready to submit a pull request, but I'd like to run the unit tests first.  However when I execute mvn package without -DskipTests, it gets class-not-found errors.  Maybe this isn't the correct way to run the unit tests.  I'll ask on the newsgroup before creating another issue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNTgxOTU2NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### ECA
However, before we can accept PR's you have to jump through some legal hoops.
* Create an Eclipse account
* Your Eclipse account must contain your github id
* You have to [sign the eclipse contributor agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php) before patches can be accepted.


After that, just create a pull request with commits in the following form:

```
Space is encoded in dataset parameter #623

meaningful description here after one empty line.

Signed-off-by: Steve Schafer <your-mail@someplace.net>

If your commits are not like this then the pull request will be rejected.

When I think of runtime I think of what's built into build/birt-packages/birt-runtime/target and also what we could download called ""birt runtime"".  It includes all the classes you need to be able to generate BIRT reports in your own application.  It also includes the web app and the war file.  I think when people want a maven repo, it's so they can conveniently include the necessary classes in their own app.  

I'll need to find out if there's a way to build the runtime independently or construct a pom that will do that.  That will be the root and then everything it depends on will need to be also published to central.  All the pom's will need to meet the maven requirements including &lt;licenses&gt;, &lt;scm&gt;, and PGP signatures.   Since this will involved a lot of changes to pom.xml files and 4.9 is now frozen I'll probably need to publish from my fork in order to publish 4.9.   Once we get 4.9 successfully published we can make sure 4.10 is ready to go.

https://maven.apache.org/repository/guide-central-repository-upload.html

When I published 4.8 under the Innovent name I pushed all the jar files to Sonatype OSSRH.  There is also a mechanism for running your own repository manager.  That might be overkill for us but let me know what you think.

You would have to make a branch from the 4.9 branch and then modify and build from that branch. Later these would have to be  merged back in the 4.10 stream.

Is it not possible to make a deploy script that publishes what is in the 4.9 repo?

Here's what I'm trying to figure out:

Constraint: Publishing to Maven Central must be done through ci.eclipse.org because that's where the credentials for org.eclipse are.

Goal: Publish BIRT 4.9 to Maven Central.

Question: Can I make changes to 4.9 pom's and have it processed through ci.eclipse.org?

I'm trying to understand what I'm doing before I pull the trigger and mess something up.

Alternatively you can make a new project 'org.eclipse.maven.deploy' that contains the new profile and build that in a new Jenkins job.

I created the branch BIRT_4.9.0_maven and created a jenkins job that is basically the same as birt-master except it refers to that branch, specifies the gpg keyring file, and invokes the release profile that I added to the pom.xml file.  It fails with this error:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-p2-plugin:2.5.0:p2-metadata (attached-p2-metadata) on project org.apache.batik.dom.birt.ext: Execution attached-p2-metadata of goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-p2-plugin:2.5.0:p2-metadata failed. IllegalArgumentException

which seems strange because org.apache.batik.dom.birt.ext doesn't invoke the tycho-p2-plugin plugin.   I get this error whether I invoke the build-server profile or not.

More info:

If I remove the ""release"" profile it should, theoretically, build as it originally did, however instead it gets a test failure:

First with we generate the sources with ""tycho-source-plugin"" and then that generated source bundle is overwritten when we generate the sources again with the ""maven-source-plugin"".

What happens if we remove the ""maven-source-plugin"" from the release profile? I think that we can remove the ""maven-javadoc-plugin"" as well since we generate the javadocs elsewhere (with Ant).

Modifying all poms before a release does not seem right.

However, if it is really needed, we can do it in the build. Use grep or something to mass replace snapshot instead of commiting it.

It just takes you to sonatype but doesn't expand the browser tree to org/eclipse/birt, but you can still manually browse to org/eclipse/birt.

But, in the not-so-great-news department, it appears that what got published is the entirety of birt but not the birt runtime pojo jars.  The pojo jars are there, but there inside the birt-runtime zip which is useless from a maven standpoint.  I believe one could still utilize the repository for the runtime but it would probably need to be an osgi configuration rather than a pojo configuration.  In order to have the pojo jars be mavenized I think we are going to create a new project and publish it to org.eclipse.birt.runtime, as has evidently been done in the past, up to version 4.6.0 and as I did a couple of years ago as org.innoventsolutions.birt.runtime.

Same here.
Ideally we would have a document describing how to set up a correct and working build environment within eclipse.
Building BIRT within Eclipse is an important prerequisite of doing changes, fixing bugs and issuing PRs
(I'm wondering if the main developers are  building BIRT solely with maven?).

IMHO, this is much more important than other things currently discussed (e.g. having a new logo/website).

1. general / import existing project - select root of cloned repo.  If I do not check ""Search for nested projects"", I get a tree view which doesn't show packages and no errors.  If I check ""Search for nested projects"", it tells me a couple of projects cannot be imported because they already exist.  Then I end up with a lot of projects and 154 errors, a lot of which are lifecycle errors.
3. I changed the lifecycle error to a warning in the workspace because I didn't want to make any changes to the repo.
4. That gets me down to 143 errors, most of which are about projects that cannot be built until their prerequisites are built.  The others are various packages and/or classes that cannot be resolved.  Then after a few minutes (while I'm typing this), it decides to rebuild on its own and then I have 53 errors, most of which are ""Access restriction ... is not API ..."", which I can change to warnings.  After that I'm down to 17 errors which is about as low as I've been able to get it.

I think that at least some of the unresolved classes and packages may be due misconfigured java build path (e.g. no source folder), java packages no longer supported (javax.xml.bind), and J2SE-1.5 execution environment.  All of these can be fixed in due course.

I do have one really weird error where it's obviously trying to unzip a pom.xml file.  It seems to be caused by an unpack goal in the maven-dependency-plugin in birt-runtime-test.  No idea why it's doing that.

I also have ""An API baseline has not been set for the current workspace"".  I've tried setting it to org.eclipse.birt.target.target but that gives me ""There is a possible API baseline mismatch since none of the workspace projects is in the baseline"",  so that probably wan't the right thing to do.  
Anyway sorry for the long-winded comment but if anyone sees anything I'm obviously doing wrong, please let me know.

There must be a historic reason but I don't know it. Probably the fop cannot be distributed with Eclipse or there is no p2 repository serving it. The reason it is not pushed into the repo is maybe because of licensing (just a wild guess). 

If fop was consumable by p2/Tycho then it should come from a recent build of the Eclipse orbit project (which does not contain it). 
https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20210223232630/

You can help by finding a p2 repo that serves our required version of fop. If you can't find it then ask the Eclipse Orbit project if they can include our required version of fop OR figure out if we can include it in our git repo. 

Make sure to create an issue for it.

Future direction would import project into eclipse as maven project. In some of our projects which uses the jar files which are not in p2 are resloved using manual jar install from local file. Updating Readme.md with necessary steps to setup local environment would be nice too.

Yes. Eclipse has a special project, called Orbit [1], that was invented exactly for this purpose. The FAQ is here [2]. There is information on how to add libraries to the Orbit project.

Yes, it is the only way to do it. Protecting our consumers from copyright infringement comes with a price.

You can help. Looking at others to solve issues will just lead to a staring circle. Please step up if you can spare a couple of hours. I will guide you. You can start by sending a message to the Orbit mailing list.

> An easiest as possible build process seems to be so much more valuable for the project than having 50 birt-dev mailing list posts about a new BIRT project logo which nobody might care about.

Judging by the posts, many find the logo important. Not you and me though, that is why we are on this ticket 😉

There is no difference and we are already cleared to use Apache FOP. However, the process of getting FOP into Orbit remains the same and we have to jump through a couple of hoops to make sure that all the legal paperwork is in order.

* Downloaded ""eclipse for commiters 2012-09"", unzipped and started it using a Java 11 SDK
* Imported branch `How_to_import_BIRT_code_into_eclipse_#628` using import -> Projects from git (with smart import)
* During import ""`marketplace solutions available: org.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNature`"" popup showed up. It seems that PDE is not sufficient? Clicked on ""show solutions"" and installed ""`Eclipse Java Enterprise Java and Web developer Tools`"" and restarted eclipse
-> eclipse rebuilt the project - result: 16768 errors left.
error 1 of 16768: `The import org.apache.batik.transcoder cannot be resolved`

Root cause is most probably that eclipse shows errors for every pom.xml file, e.g.:

* `Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-compiler-plugin:2.4.0:compile (execution: default-compile, phase: compile)`
*` Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-antrun-plugin:3.0.0:run (execution: generate.property.files, phase: compile)`
* `Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-packaging-plugin:2.4.0:build-qualifier (execution: default-build-qualifier, phase: validate)`

Regarding ignoring the pom.xml:
Is there a way to mass apply this change (ideally by committing a preference file or something)?
The quick fix 'select all' only allows me to select 7 pom.xml at a time so I would have to do this many times.

2. Unzip this in a known location e.g. ~user/eclipse/baselines/

Not so much to an older Eclipse release but more to an older BIRT release. If we want BIRT to run against the API of an older Eclipse release then we have to build against that version. The current target platform runs against the latest Eclipse version. This means that we now can use new Eclipse API that would prevent BIRT from running on older Eclipse releases.

However, I have no intention to support older Eclipse releases. For that, we have BIRT 4.8. 

The other reason is that any new BIRT API is properly documented with a ""@since"" tag. If this is not the case then the baseline will complain. Try adding a new API (e.g. public method) to a project that uses the baseline and you will see an error appearing.

The error is an error for Eclipse but it does not prevent running BIRT. The error can also be switched off in the preferences. Also, the lifecycle errors that you got are just logical errors as far as Eclipse is concerned.  It does not hinder the execution of BIRT from within Eclipse.

For /org.eclipse.birt.chart.device.pdf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF  lib/fop-2.3.jar is missing.
For /org.eclipse.birt.build/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF lib/dom4j-1.6.1.jar is missing.

You can't really build with compliance set to Java 11 because it complains about APIs being visible from multiple different modules.

For  /org.eclipse.birt.data.oda.pojo.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF the Fragment-Host doesn't resolve, it should probably be Fragment-Host: org.eclipse.birt.data.oda.pojo;bundle-version=""[2.1.0,5.0.0)"" instead.

For org.eclipse.birt.report.debug.internal.ui.launcher.util.ReportLauncherUtils.getEclipseHome() it should probably be like this
```
	public static IPath getEclipseHome() {
		return new Path(TargetPlatform.getLocation());
	}
```

For org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer.mock.ServletContextSimulator it should implement more 'newer' methods.

And of course all the Maven errors should be disabled, at least for now...

There's also the issue of Jetty dependencies and where to get those.  The ones proved by the platform/SimRel aren't all the ones that are needed...

Given that things are in a state of flux and are quite badly broken, it's not really so feasible to automate the setup process at the moment.

For the report designer to run you have to create a run configuration. There is already one run configuration available, you can run from there:

For the unit test to run you also have to create a run configuration. You can start finding the classes that are name AllTests and run these as JUnit plugins tests. This will create a run configuration that you will have to tweak in the Run Configuration dialog

Say you have created a new 2-column table item.
If you try to drag the column widths with the mouse to make e.g. the first column ca. 3 cm wide, this results in the first column having a width of (available-width - 3 cm).

This did not happen in BIRT 4.2.1.
OTOH, in BIRT 4.2.1, dragging the column width of *any* column caused *every* column to have a fixed width - and the table as a whole, too.
Now, in the 2-column example, the second column has no specified width - which is good.
When coaching, I always tell users to *not* use the mouse to set column widths, because I think it's usually much better if the table and at least one column do not have a specified width. With newer BIRT releases, this recommendation is no longer as important as before.

What I could find out so far by adding some debug messages in drawBorder is:
In the first call to PageDeviceRender::drawBorder, the expression tb.rowBorders.get( tb.tableLRY ) returns null, which causes the NPE, while String.valueOf(tb.rowBoders) looks like this:

For a test, I reverted the changes from commit https://github.com/eclipse/birt/commit/f84d0f812a72ba8e54f6caf641e16442d480594c in file org\eclipse\birt\report\engine\nLayout\area\impl\TableLayout.java.

Additionally there is a size limit on the name but the emitter code doesn't take that into account when searching for duplicate names, which can also lead to errors.  The latter issue is definitely a bug.  For the first issue I think it would be acceptable for the emitter to edit the names before setting them, although this might be a matter of opinion.

I have zero experience with using maven for building things that require eclipse plugins.

And regarding the question in the bug, the 40 (rows) is the default page break for lists and/or tables, so it is correct if the emitter creates a new sheet every 40 records. Unfortunately the maximum value was 9999, maybe this is still the case.
The emitter options can usually be set as user properties, but probably also in other easy.  Unfortunately yaytay's bitbucket repository, which also contained documentation, is no longer available.
I'm pretty sure that *any* emitter option can be set in the URL query, but I don't use it myself, so I don't know exactly this works.

If you add on the root element the user property ""ExcelEmitter.SingleSheet"" (Boolean) and set the value to ""true"" then you avoid multi-page sheets.
But you have to handle the repeat of header if it is active due to usage on PDF-site.

The spudsoft-Emitter has further additional options which can be set on report root tag based on user properties like ""ExcelEmitter.RemoveBlankRows"" or ""ExcelEmitter.DisableGrouping"".

By default there isn't a way to configure the xlsx-Emitter-behavior based on the viewer.properties.
To do this the java-component of the viewer (according property-handling) must be rewritten.

Therefore I used another way to solve your requirement.
You can change the viewer-export dialog directly:
C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\webapps\birt\webcontent\birt\ajax\ui\dialo\BirtExportReportDialog.js 

In this JS-File is a function definition ""	__exportAction : function( ) { ... }"" and there I added the following sequence to manipulate the URL-call at the moment of export:

__exportAction : function( ) { ...

			// Delete page, pagerange and parameterpage settings in url if existed
			action = birtUtility.deleteURLParameter( action, Constants.PARAM_PAGE );
			action = birtUtility.deleteURLParameter( action, Constants.PARAM_PAGERANGE );
			action = birtUtility.deleteURLParameter( action, Constants.PARAM_PARAMETERPAGE );
			action = birtUtility.deleteURLParameter( action, Constants.PARAM_EMITTER_ID );

			if( format == ""xlsx"" ) {
				action = action + ""&__ExcelEmitter.SingleSheet=true"";
			}
...
}

In my test cases I got only Single-Sheet files with change. Be carefull with this change you haven't directly an Option to get Multi-Sheets. The option on report level won't be work like overwrite, the url settings have higher priority.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNzg0MTE1NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Update: It works.  Also the URL parameter works when going directly to xlsx.  Due to my dyslexia (which is really lazy reading on my part) I had the parameter name wrong.  So this solves the problem for me, and, as far as I'm concerned, it's no longer important to be able to set the default value in viewer.properties.

A few more comments:  I guess if you send a get request and the server returns something you could say that's a REST service but the problem is it has no security.  For that reason you might want to leave URL_REPORT_PATH_POLICY at its default value which is ""domain"".  The viewer will then check to be sure the service is on the same domain as the viewer but it doesn't care about the port.  You should be able to run a service on the same machine as the viewer but on a different port.  I haven't actually tried this but that's how I read the code.  Additionally you might want to block that port from the outside world.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTI5NTEzNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Probably you should contact Alexander Kurtakov.

Just to clarify this.
The problem is not Jetty in general, but specifically compiling JSP pages?

Do we need JSP at all?

From what I see in the BIRT sources, there are only 3 *.jsp files:

  *   chartImage.jsp
  *   control.jsp
  *   Userpreference.jsp

All three only contain static content and could be replaced with pure HTML files, as it seems.
From this point of view we could just stop using JSP.

Disclaimer: I am not using the Web Viewer – maybe there are other reasons for JSP…

However, in that bug, it was said that one reason for doing the things that way, was some conflict with the ""help system"".

I don't care about the help system as long as the BIRT IDE is unusable (I don't see why a help system needs JSP at all).
So, is it an option to add org.apache.jasper (not org.apache.jasper.glassfish) as a dependency somehow?

The 404 error is caused by org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler.Default404Servlet.  When the request comes in, Jetty looks in a list of servlets and the Default404Servlet is the only thing in that list.  Servlets can only be added to that list in ServletHandler.setServletMappings() and that method is never called by the ViewerPlugin or anywhere other than to add the 404 servlet.  I don't really know where it should be called, so I'm going to see what an older version of BIRT looks like, where the viewer used to work.

Jetty now uses SLF4J for logging. SLF4J ist more or less just an API for logging. It needs a binding to another library which actually performs the logging, such as java.util.logging, logback oder log4j. Without such a binding, it will log only exactly one message to tell you that it won't log any messages (using a no-op binding).
There are some of these bindings in Orbit, but I don't know how to make this work.

SLF4j requires an implementation at runtime. This means that jetty needs a dependency on a logging implementation otherwise OSGi will not allow jetty to see anything, no matter how many implementation bundles are active.

You can try to create a fragment that has the jetty bundle as a master and which depends on an slf4j implementation. Master plugins are able to see all dependencies from their fragments.

regarding https://github.com/eclipse/birt/blob/master/viewer/org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer/pom.xml:

i compared your POM with mine (Report viewer works in my setup).
Are you sure that you don't need to declare the dependencies in the plugin section? I would suspect that the required jar files are missing otherwise in the final deployment.

at the end you find my plugin section for org.eclipse.jetty.
i remember that originally jspc compiler was set to glassfish but you can also use tomcat.
In my setup, glassfish is commented out and tomcat jspc is the one that is used.

I hope this helps.
Andrej

In my setup, glassfish is commented out and tomcat jspc is the one that is used.

Hi Andrej @adiinfo-77 ,

Could you please propose a PR based on your setup?

Thanks in advance,

i made the pull request.

I also had a look at the automatically generated maven build. are you aware of the fact that:
- you work simultaneously working with Jetty 10.0.6 and Jetty 9.4.4? Is this intended?
- the slf4j Logger Class is not loaded
if Jetty 10 and Jetty 9 use different versions of slf4j (and i think this is likely), than you will have most likely classloader-problems there. Apart from other side effects when using jar's from Jetty 9 and Jetty 10.

i made a copy of the maven messages in question at the end of this comment.

Thank you
Andrej

Since Jetty can use slf4j1.7.3, I :
* added the slf4j simple logger to the target platform (from the Orbit p2 repo).
* removed the slf4j 2.0.0 alpha 1 bundles from the debug configuration
* added slf4j 1.7.3 bundles to the debug configuration

On another note:
I really tried to get it to work with slf4j 2.0.0 alpha1. It should be possible, according to this post: https://www.mail-archive.com/slf4j-user@qos.ch/msg00878.html .

This may be easier to solve with jetty 10.0.7 , which is using slf4j 2.0.0 alpha5, which in turn has the missing ""Require-Capability"" header in alpha1, but it does not seam like the simple logger (alpha5), has the corresponding ""Provides-Capability"". Some more info here: https://jira.qos.ch/browse/SLF4J-457

i had to close (delete) my pull request.

On double checking, it turned out that while the RCP Report Designer does start, the Jetty Http-Server does not.

The only working configuration i have is as described here: https://www.optimaw.ch/change-to-jdk11-lts/ (Point 5)
This configuration works only with Jetty 9.4.15 and a modified jetty-jspc-maven-plugin from the 9.0.x branch. And furthermore, only with the (very old) Glassfish JSPC-Compiler.

Sorry for the inconvenience

when i did my work on updating BIRT, i struggled most of the time with the precompilation of the JSP files in the report viewer. I did never understand, why the precompilation was done a all! To my knowledge, JSP-Files must be copied to WEB-INF\src for automatic precompilation. But the BIRT build-process copies the jsp-files to WEB-INF\classes.
When i tried to switch from Glassfish to Tomcat Precompiler, Tomcat did obviously not precompile the JSP-files as these were not in WEB-INF\src.

Also, even if i got Tomcat to precompile these files by manual measures, the classpath in the resulting viewer.jar was wrong. With Glassfish precompiler, it was org.eclipse.birt (correct), with Tomcat the classpath was diffrent (i do not remember what it was, probably org.apache).

That's why i changed the source code of the old jetty-jspc-maven-plugin so that it could be used with Java 6 source code level. And that's why i have still to use Glassfish JSP Precompiler.

Maybe this helps a bit.
Andrej

@claesrosell : 

Yeah, this is great! The preview is actually working!

I tested this from within Exclipse only, not yet with the Maven build.
The SLF4J still not working. Did you commit the changes to make it work as well?

And there are some errors logged in the BIRT IDE, but this is a huge step forward.

I've set up a complete report and when I want to preview this in web viewer, the page footer is in the middle of the page. Also, if i try to print the report, it will be right after the content instead of in the bottom. It seems to be floating. I can't find how to adjust this setting.
 

Expected result:
Page footer displays at the end of the report.
 
Actual result:
Page footer displayed in the middle of the report right after the last content.
 
Note - When exporting the report to a PDF and print it from there, the page footer is at the bottom. this Only happens in web viewer/html.

I know you asked for the RPT file, unfortunately, the files is within two remote desktops and I currently can't get it to my main computer. Hope the photos works, if not, let me know.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/652/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If you want to generate a PDF or if you want to print the report, you should not create HTML output with BIRT and then let the browser do the conversion. Instead you should create a PDF *directly*.

I confirm the analysis of Steve. The reason is located at the ""org.eclipse.birt.report.engine_4.8.0.v201806261756"".
The image class hasn't a validation of a data-URL. Currently only absolut or relativ URLs are supported
or usage of the image-Item from the designer.

The api.impl.Image.class should be enhanced to implements an additional check of ""data:image""-URL.
The data stream can be parsed with Base64.decodeBase64(vars[""imageJpgBase64""]); to an byteArray[].

I have tested the decode with png, jpg and svg to (especially the svg needs explicit setting of ""type expression"" to image/svg+xml to get the correct result).

Have we somebody which is familiar with the emitter-plugin and could add the change?

Best regards

I don't think so - but maybe you can try this yourself?
Right now, it seems like Steve, Wim and myself are the only active developers - I am doing this as a side project and I think that Steve and Wim are in the same situation.
Any help is welcome!
Changing the emitter should be possible and not too complicated: I think it works like ""download the image data to a byte array, then use the byte array"". For data-URLs, instead of downloading the image data, the base64-content just has to be decoded.
It looks like changing org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.impl.Image  and perhaps org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.util.FileUtil (isLocalResource) would suffice.
Perhaps I'll tackle this on a rainy autumn night...

Anyway, the workaround that you are describing should be possible with Javascript inside the report - at least if yor are not using images inside text paragraphs.
The idea would be to parse the HTML for img containing data URLs, save the data as a (temporary) file and replace the data URL with a file URL, then delete the temporary files as soon as the PDF is built.
But I don't think that even _static_ images inside HTML dynamic text items will work in the PDF emitter (never actually tried this).

currently there are 2 issues. The original issues isn't based on the chart-object or the image-object.
The first issue is located on the ""Text"" and when it is used like HTML. The next step is to add a image-tage and use a soruce with base64-coding e.g. <img src=""data:image/png;base64,..."">

The previe like HTML looks fine but the pdf-extract doesn't display the image - I will attache my example.
One solution could be to optimize the image.class so that the base64-stream will be written to the working directory.

The second issue is that the standard image-object at the designer doesn't accept SVG-Images like embeeded image
and the usage of SVG like shared sources make the image-object not longer changable and after report reloaed the report self ist crashed.
The BIRT-engine seems to convert in every case the SVG to a JPGE-image.

I have a query related to this issue
“java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid version number: Version number may be negative or greater than 255""
 
Let me brief you few analysis part
As currently we are using ""com.ibm.icu_3.6.1.v20070906.jar"" jar in our project.
This jar is getting used in reporting tool(Birt report) of our product.
 
In recent months we upgraded our product java to 8.0.6.15 version but our reporting tool throws this error
*************
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid version number: Version number may be negative or greater than 255
at com.ibm.icu.util.VersionInfo.getInstance(VersionInfo.java:194)
at com.ibm.icu.impl.ICUDebug.getInstanceLenient(ICUDebug.java:65)
*************
 
At previous , I approached icu-support with short analysis over this issue.
we got response at that time i.e ""this issue fixed in icu4j.jar(of version 68).So you can use this version of jar"".
 
Later we analysed more and test , found we are using ""com.ibm.icu_3.6.1.v20070906.jar"" in the reporting tool not icu4j.jar.
Further we upgarded our java version to 8.0.6.20,8.0.6.25 & 8.0.6.30. Finally we are using java 8.0.6.30 now. And still our birt repoting tool throwing the same error which we got on 8.0.6.15 version of java.
 
Although the error was in Birt module so I checked with Eclipse support who managed this Birt project. But they directed me that this is an ICU4J issue.
 
As we analysed deeply the issue and found the source of exception is from versionInfo.class. We know there is a check placed in versionInfo.class to check the minor/macro version of java and it hardcoded as 255.
But java version start from 8.0.6.15(261) exceeding the limit of 255.It is the main source of issue.
As downgrading java version 8.0.6.10 also works here to solve this issue , but it is not good approach.
For testing scenario , we modified the code of versionInfo.java and replace the 255 check to some higher version such as 301 or 311.
And our testing results show no error afterwards.
 
As per your old communication i.e this issue fixed in 68 version of icu4j.jar
I tried to find out the references ,
https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21295
https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/1245
https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21219
https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/icu4j/main/classes/core/src/com/ibm/icu/util/VersionInfo.java#L294
 
I also found one link of github which having code commits indicating the fix.
https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/1245/commits/ab08fac17025dd9c166038160fd2042b10dcb2f1
 
At next , part of testing area we also did the same change in VersionInfo.class(com.ibm.icu_3.6.1.v20070906.jar) as provided in above link of code commit to resolve this issue.
But we found same issue occured in this testing.
 
This is our main concern/query
we are using this jar com.ibm.icu_3.6.1.v20070906.jar, I believe in order to fix this issue we have to place new jar of com.ibm.icu*.
 
*Is this code commit  sufficient to resolve this issue? or any other code changes is required? as in our env  this change not worked.
https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/1245/commits/ab08fac17025dd9c166038160fd2042b10dcb2f1
 
*In which version of com.ibm.icu* this issue got fixed?
 
*How we can get the fixed jar of com.ibm.icu* version?
 
*Icu4j jar of version 68/69 got release which including the fix of this issue(as communicated).
I did not found any reference which showing the release of these jars com.ibm.icu* , Can you please let us aware who is responsible for the release of newer version com.ibm.icu* jars.
Kindly let us know.
 
 

Please help us to resolve this issue, we are blocked due to it.

Just have few queries
As I checked the latest released Birt modules i.e
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.birt
https://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/drops/
https://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/drops/I-R1-4.9.0-201905231911/

May I know this issue covered in which next probable release?
What is the tracking id for this issue?
The current Birt release containing the jar named as ""com.ibm.icu_63.1.0.v20181030-1705.jar"" , so please let me know what version would be the next release of com.ibm.icu  jar?
At what time we expect the fix for this issue ?

These information we needed, as asked by our product management team to keep track this issue to fix in our product.


Thanks

FYI, that plugin comes from https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.11 which is specified in org.eclipse.birt.target.target.  The most recent version of updates is 4.20, which has a more recent version of com.ibm.icu, which covers more recent versions of unicode.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to upgrade to updates 4.20, if it doesn't conflict with anything.  I'll give that a try.

CVE-2019-0227 | Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
CVE-2018-8032 | Cross-site scripting (XSS)
CVE-2014-3596 | SSL spoofing
CVE-2012-5784 | SSL spoofing
CVE-2007-2353 | Request non-existent WSDL file reveals AXIS installation path

Axis 1.4 is used for SOAP communication in the viewer.  The Orbit plugin org.apache.axis_1.4.0.v201411182030.jar embeds axis.jar which hasn't changed since 2006.  A github repository for axis 1.4 has been kept up to date however: https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java which contains fixes for all of these bugs except possibly CVE-2007-2353.  The jar file can be rebuilt from this repository and I have done this successfully for one of our clients.

I'm not sure what the right approach is for this.
- Build the jar from source and update the Orbit plugin (how to do that?)
- Build the jar from source and embed it in the BIRT repo without using the Orbit plugin (how to do that?)
- Convert to axis 2.  This is may be a rabbit hole.

I recently created this repository with bundles in source form for things that just aren't available with source on Maven central.

https://github.com/eclipse-orbit/orbit-legacy

We really don't want to be in the business of maintaining more and more source bundle ourselves. That being said, there are quite a few dependencies on org.apache.axis, including from the bundles already in this source repository.

https://github.com/eclipse-orbit/orbit-legacy/blob/86d45aa9c636a78cd6934f510e65c6b1a6aa2e5d/plugins/org.uddi4j/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF#L51-L54

I don't think it makes sense for BIRT to maintain its own copy of this (or any other 3rd party bundle).

Scanning my maven central index, this appears to be a newer version:

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/geronimo/bundles/axis/1.4_2/

Is it possible that this one is fixed?  It's from 2011...

Failing that, I think such a problem should be addressed in Orbit so that it can be reused more broadly.  As such, I opened this issue:

https://github.com/eclipse-orbit/orbit-simrel/issues/16

Probably it's best to continue the discussion there. ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5nvPFR/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The jar files provided by maven are not OSGi bundles.  Also it looks like batik.anim is provided by maven as a whole and batik.anim.dom is a part of it.  So I think that the batik.anim jar would need to be wrapped in a plugin that identifies itself as org.apache.batik.anim.dom and exports all the batik.anim.dom packages in the manifest, similar to what I did with axis (is that what you mean by ""fat jar""?)  The best way to do this is by adding it to Orbit, so that others who use these bundles won't run into the same problem.  Or perhaps the dependency on org.apache.batik.anim.dom is a mistake that needs to be corrected.

@ruspl-afed 2020-06 is what I happened to have on-hand.  I'll try a more recent version if there is one.  Also there's the BIRT all-in-one package.  I wonder if that would work.

What I know at this point:
When I add the jars manually as described in this [comment](https://github.com/eclipse/birt/issues/666#issuecomment-901459259), I can install the birt framework which still depends on jetty 9.x in the target.  **After installation, I can only see jetty 10 bundles in the osgi console**.  But I haven't been able to accomplish this without manually installing the jars.  I can add jetty 9.x in help->install new software and successfully install but then all the jetty 9.x bundles are included.  If I try to change the target to depend on jetty 10, I can't get it to build.  Following some of the suggestions in [eclipse/jetty.project#2153](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/2153) and [bugzilla 494913](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494913#c2) such as adding org.eclipse.equinox.ds or org.apache.felix.scr have not been fruitful.  But I'm finding that the target file is very brittle and it's easy to break things with random changes.  Next step is to figure out how to add Apache Aries SPI Fly and try to learn more about it, although I don't understand why it should be needed since jetty 9.x installs without it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc42Rbow/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I made the following changes:

Add these plugins to features/org.eclipse.birt.feature/feature.xml:
org.apache.batik.anim
org.apache.batik.awt.util
org.apache.batik.gvt
org.apache.batik.script
org.apache.commons.collections4
org.apache.commons.math3
org.apache.poi.ooxml
org.apache.poi.ooxml.schemas
org.eclipse.jetty.osgi.boot
javax.transaction
org.eclipse.jetty.deploy
org.apache.xmlbeans

Add org.apache.poi.ooxml.schemas in configuration excludes in tycho-source-feature-plugin in features/org.eclipse.birt.feature/pom.xml and /pom.xml

So PR 640 will fix this issue if you make those changes and once you get the testing issues worked out.

Steve, when we use a package import, P2 cannot resolve it to a bundle. AFAIK, P2 does not know which bundle exports which package. 

In order for a bundle to be installed,  one of the following needs to be true:
* its dependencies need to be installed before 
* or its dependency needs to be _included_ 
* or its dependency is **required** in the feature.

Including third-party bundles in our feature is **not good**. 

However, if a bundle cannot be resolved we can require the bundle in the feature. This will tell P2 to pull in the bundle.

The first option, dependencies need to be installed before, I think means the user would need to install something via Help -> Install New Software, or at least add a repository to the repo list prior to installing the BIRT framework, which is something we are trying to avoid.  I think BIRT should install into JEE Eclipse without any additional steps.  Let me know if you disagree.

The second option I think means embedding these jars into a plugin's lib folder in BIRT and exporting packages in its manifest.  Is that correct?  That's what I did for axis.

I've been using BIRT since a long time (even working for Actuate, before it went bought by OpenText), and i'm happy to see that a ""new community"" is getting built around the OpenSource Version again.

We were using the Plugin version 4.7.0.v201706222054 with Eclipse 2019-09 (4.13.0) and we had problem to open existing rptdesign. After having updated the plugin to the last version you guys built (4.9.0.v202108150822), all went fine, cheers!!

Our rptdesign are embedded into a Java Application which uses the Birt Runtime Engine to render reports as PDF. In order to get the engine, our application has the following dependency:

```
 <dependency>
	<groupId>org.eclipse.birt.runtime</groupId>
	<artifactId>org.eclipse.birt.runtime</artifactId>
	<version>4.4.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Looking at the central Maven Repository, it seems that nothing's really moving with BIRT Runtime: https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.birt.runtime%22%20AND%20a%3A%22org.eclipse.birt.runtime%22

Do you have somewhere a kind of supported product matrix which would provide the following information:

- Which Eclipse Version is supported by which plugin
- Which BIRT Runtime Version supports which rptdesign
- Which Java Version is supported by which BIRT Runtime

I did some digging in old Eclipse code and found out that the old ICoreConstant.PLATFORM_PATH is replaced by a static method on TargetPlatform.  Just to get it to compile and work on the same level as recently the only thing that seems to be needed is to replace:

```
public static IPath getEclipseHome() {
	Preferences preferences = PDECore.getDefault().getPluginPreferences();
	return new Path(preferences.getString(ICoreConstants.PLATFORM_PATH));
}
```

with

```
public static IPath getEclipseHome() {
	return new Path(TargetPlatform.getLocation());
}
```

However, to use the location of the TargetPlatform to locate the EclipseHome might have been correct a decade ago, but probably not anymore.

I think that this is related to that Java-11 has a newer version of javax.xml.* and Xerces bundled and BIRT (and dependencies) traditionally uses other sources for that API (orbit or maven central). This causes errors like :

""The package org.xml.sax is accessible from more than one module: \<unnamed\>, java.xml""

... which, to my knowledge, implies that the package is available both on the classpath and the modulepath. In some cases removing ""javax.xml"" from ""Required-Bundle"" or some xml import from ""Import-Package"" but in other cases there seems to be other things causing the troubles.

I have found discussions about these matters on both bugs.eclipse.org and stackoverflow, and I will read up more on it.

@claesrosell once we got everything working, it might make sense to rebase the branch and cleanup the commit history so that we have commits that are easier to understand. That probably makes more sense that splitting it up over several PRs.

I looked into the changes and I think it is important to get the viewer to also compile with java 11, as we will likely run into problems at runtime if it is included into java 11 applications. In my first investigation, I found out, that the compile problems there are caused by the ancient version (1.1.0) of `javax.xml.rpc` defined as a dependency there. As an experiment, I replaced it with the 1.1.2 version that I downloaded from maven central, and now it is compiling with java 11. Just adding that jar to the git repo is not a good option though. Do you have a mechanism set up, to convert external maven dependencies to osgi bundles, if they are not available from orbit? We could add the 1.1.2 version there and see if this still works.

I then tried to start BIRT using the BIRT all in one configuration shipped with the development workspace. This got stuck in the resolver phase though. By adding `osgi.debug` options to the startup, I could see why, there was a very long list of errors like this one:

There is an org.eclipse.birt.target.target file (find it with CTRL+SHIFT+R) that enables you to get that version from maven central. Just take a look at the source, it explains itself.

I cannot find javax.xml.rpc explicitly in our target platform. I think that it is currently provided by one of the webtools features that we are using, might be wrong though.
v1.1.2 of javax.xml.rpc on maven central have OSGI headers, so we can use that one during buildtime by adding it to the .target as a dependency.

I will look into it later today.

Switching to javax.xml.rpc 1.1.2 does not solve the problem since that version of javax.xml.rpc has dependencies (Import-Package) to package javax.xml.rpc;version=""1.1"" . (The old version of javax.xml.rpc is still in the target platform via a feature, I think.)

From my point of view, this is an error in javax.xml.rpc. If I ""Import as Source"" that bundle and removes the self referencing ""Import-Package:"" statements the complete workspace compiles without errors.

I do not really know howto proceed with this. 

* Ship own version of javax.xml.rpc (as we do with axis)
* Stay on Java-1.8
* Other

Ideas?

For the copyright notice in java files, I made the script smart enough to pull the creation year from the existing notice but otherwise I ignored everything else and replaced it with this:

```

I could make the script pull the original contributor name if you think that's necessary.  Otherwise is this acceptable?

Also, if the java file did not contain a notice, I added one with 2021 as the creation year.

I am not going to spoon-feed you, my friend. We learn from frustration and bumping our noses. :)  Good to see your frustration level rise ;)

>What does it make sense forcing me starting 20 application types when you know the answer or when it is somewhere configured? I started 3, but I don't see any difference.

There are only a couple of them in the org.eclipse.birt namespace. Also, you have to **clean your configuration** before you start a new application otherwise you will not see any difference. Before you ask me how to do that, take a good look at the launch configuration form.

If an application does not run, you have to examine the messages. Most of the time there is a missing plugin or there are too many plugins.

I will organize a teams session for Monday. We can do a Q&A there.

Thank you for your testing efforts. Your tests were a driver for the recent developments. Try to stay positive.

You extract this somewhere and - given that you have a matching JRE (Java version and correct 32 or 64 bit) - you can start eclipse.exe in that directory.
Personally, I use a CMD script for this which ensures a correct environment, but this is not strictly necessary.
This eclipse.exe is the IDE.
Your first step should be to 

1. Close the **misleading welcome screen** (which is suited for Java development),
2. Create a fresh workspace, and then open the Report Design perspective,
3. Create a new BIRT project ""birt"" (a directory where your rptdesign files go)
4. Create e.g. a folder for your libraries. I prefer a directory ""res"" inside ""birt"".
5. From the menu, choose Window / Preferences / Report Design / Resource append ""/res"" (corresponding to 4) so that it reads ""<Current Project Folder>/res"".

Thanks!
I was only able to choose between product and application configuration.
What I did: I chose `org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui.rcp.BIRT` project first, then switched the radio button to 'application' and chose  `org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench` - this finally started the right ""application"".
I need to do some more tests, but it looks like the original all-in-one designer package.

The viewer is not working, I know this had been discussed recently - is the github issue #649 the right one for this (because I don't get any stacktrace, just a 404 in the browser when doing a PDF preview)?

Thanks for your tutorial how to run the junit tests in the other issue!

I have question regarding the last step, making the plugin configuration for the tests identical to the birt-run launch configuration: 
Is there a shortcut to export this from birt-run and import it in the test configuration (ideally, we would have a pre-packaged launch configuration for the tests as well).
What about the checkboxes below the plugin list?

Yes :) Sorry for the confusion.
Because that's what I need when doing changes/fixes - to test them locally.
The all-in-one-designer is perfect for this, because I can test everything  (from design to 'emitter')
within one application.

I don't think there is a shortcut. The shortest way is maybe editing the file in a text editor. Launch configs are a moving target because of adding/removing future plugins. Launch configs can be different on different platforms. Therefore the developers should understand what makes them tick so that they can create/change them quickly.

Otherwise, we need to rely on manual synchronization which will lead to increased effort (how do I know I need to adjust my plugins configuration?) and the developer needs to have a deeper understanding of the eclipse and BIRT ecosystem just to fix a trivial bug which is a hurdle for new contributors (like me for example).

The very hard way: I build the source with mvn, then extract the  ZIP, start eclipse, set up a workspace, import the project, run a report. With older versions I also managed to debug from within Eclipse, but similar to you, I either forgot how to do this or it did no longer work in the same way as in 4.2.1.

The ~100,000 warnings are not helpful for performance.  I think this is made worse by the fact that projects contain nested projects, e.g., /org.eclipse.birt-parent contains the entire tree and each of the branches is also a project duplicated in the explorer that also contains a tree of projects, also duplicated in the explorer. 

Because of this structure, doing a search will find matches in multiple copies of the same file.

I think it would be good to use resource filters to hide the contents of subprojects, but that's a fair bit of work to set up and I want to be sure that there is agreement to do this before I spend time doing that.

Here's what it looks like now:

It could be made to look like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/208716/140882114-38fb0a25-8521-4f8c-b90d-1da602073ced.png)

with a filter like this in the .project file
```
	<filteredResources>
		<filter>
			<id>1636443535383</id>
			<name></name>
			<type>10</type>

				<arguments>1.0-name-matches-false-true-[^.].*</arguments>

Or it could be made to look like this:

Currently, we add the following BIRT/eclipse jars to the classpath:

Afterwards, we start the platform, load the design handle and create the runAndRender task:

```
    Platform.startup(engineConfig_);
    this.reportEngine_ = new ReportEngine(engineConfig_);
    reportEngine_.changeLogLevel(Level.WARNING);
    this.pdfRenderOption_.setOutputFormat(FILE_EXTENSION);
    this.reportRunnable_ = reportEngine_.openReportDesign(this.reportDesign_);
    this.runAndRenderTask_ = reportEngine_.createRunAndRenderTask(reportRunnable_);		 
```

For each to-be-created PDF we do:
```
    this.runAndRenderTask_.setRenderOption(pdfRenderOption_);
    runAndRenderTask_.setLocale(Locale.GERMAN);
    this.runAndRenderTask_.run();
```

We are using the ""birt-runtime"" here (without OSGI). But instead of explicitly adding single JARs we just add ReportEngine/lib/* to the classpath. This includes all the files in that directory.

This requires the Maven build of course.

But to just test modifications of the BIRT source, we do not need to do it this way:
Our reports are written in such a way that they can be tested from within the BIRT designer (the DB connection info is supplied using environment variables then). So I can test from within Eclipse instead of from our application.
Soemtimes, when trying to fix a bug, I try to create a simple test case using only the builtin sample database. This makes testing the effect of source code changes even easier and allows other BIRT developers to see the effect as well.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc45lsmM/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Glad to hear that we're not the only one integrating BIRT that way.
Thanks for the info for the non-OSGI approach / BIRT runtime, I will definitely look into that.

You're completely right, we do it in a similar way that we can test everything in the BIRT designer (except that we don't use DB connections within BIRT, we decoupled the db model from the BIRT design model, so our process is roughly -> Export relevant data from DB to XML, start our application which invokes BIRT in the above way and the design uses the xml as a datasource).

However, I know that there are performance issues and memory leaks in the BIRT engine (at least in the version we're using) which only appear when creating many PDFs within one ReportEngine.
In order to fix them it is much more easier invoking the rendering task multiple times automatically instead of manually clicking 20 times on the preview button (and the viewer is currently not working).

Is there a way to achieve this? 
I would love to improve memory consumption and maybe even rendering performance.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc45lxpG/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I don't know about BIRT specific memory leaks and performance issues.
But in the process model that we are running BIRT reports (sevearl Java processes, each one processes several reports single-threaded) I noticed that
- BIRT needs quite a lot of memory when generating a complex PDF report. This is ok though.
- So our JVM processes are created with eg -xmx 512m or 1024m (for larger reports) (don't know the exact syntax of the memory parameters right now)
- The JVM seemts to perform a ""big"" GC only when the heap reaches its maximum (by default).
- The GC then takes a lot of time
- Having too low -xmx values causes the JVM to perform GC too often (e.g. moving a lot of small objects only to get tiny new bits of free space). This causes hight CPU load and slow reports.
- Having too high -xmx values can cause out-of-memory errors on the OS side (or in Java) with this multi-process model because by default the JVM does not give back unused memory to the OS.
- Before we switched to the multi-process report execution model, we used a mult-threaded single process. The reason why we switched was because some reports (e.g. containing many charts or images) need a lot of memory, while others only need a little bit. The little report may run into OutOfMemoryError when allocating a few dozen bytes because the big report allocated hundres of MB. Users don't understand this. And once you have OOM, the only thing you can safely do with your JVM is to exit the process. So one report could cause failures in other reports. This risk is minimized with the multi-process execution model.

In order to do load testing or performance testing, you should definitely use test scripts or programs with loops which start e.g. 1000 reports and wait until all 1000 are finished.

Eclipse shows 487 errors and ~100K warnings.

I was able to solve this. Now I only have one remaining error message:

    Host bundle 'org.eclipse.birt.data.oda.pojo.ui' cannot be resolved

in org.eclipse.birt.data.oda.pojo.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.mf

This seems to be a basic beginner's eclipse issue. I think it is worth mentioning.

What I had to do:

1) Choose the JRE that came with the eclipse installer in Preferences / Java / Installed JREs

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644776/141752234-ed3e9104-4a23-447a-b94e-d0b660cd7a44.png)

I have to repeat this every time I start eclipse.exe, as it seems. Otherwise Eclipse finds and uses the JRE 11 in c:\prog\jdk\... and that causes a lot of ""Failed to init ct.sym"" errors.

2)

For birt-runtime-test (inside BIRT Tests) and org.eclipse.birt.axis.overlay (inside BIRT Bundles) I had to explicitly choose JavaSE-11 in the build path.

For Linux: A single XPM icon (I have no idea about the pixel size).
For Mac OS X: A signle ICNS file
For Windows: BMP images in 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 (each one in 8-bit and 32-bit), and 256x256 (32-bit) (I think 32-bit means RGBA.

In the tab ""Branding"" the same pixel sizes are mentioned (without a specific file format), plus the dimensions 64x64 and 128x128.

In addition, the ""Branding"" tab supports an image for the ""About dialog"": ""Its size must not exceed 500x330 pixels. The text is not shown if the image size exceeds 250x330 pixels"". Not sure if the 330 is x or y, but I think it should be ""Portrait"" in BIRTspeech.

It should suffice if you send me the file in the different sizes as a 8-bit PNG (with a palette that contains a transparent color) and as 32-bit PNG (RGB with alpha channel), then I will convert them to the different platform-specific file formats.

Please note that I think that the logo from https://github.com/eclipse/birt-website/tree/main/static/img/BIRT-Logo.png is not suitable for using it as an icon - just because it is not more or less quadratic.

As @hvbtup mentions: we need a quadratic version of the logo.
Do we have contact with the author of the logo?

I think that we will need, at least:

* quadratic version
* monochrome versions (black and white)
* a combination of the above but adjusted for smaller sizes like 16x16 and 24x24

I have tested to create quadratic monochrome versions by just removing the ""BiRT"" text, changing colors to black on the logo elements and render it to a small size, it looks ok, but would need an artists touch.

I did not even save the SVG file.
I think that we should try to get in touch with the original artist and ask for additional versions of the logo. If we fail with that, perhaps we can look into other solutions, depending on which license the logo is released under. I assume that the logo is under a EPL compatible license, but I have not found any evidence yet.

You can know find the requested files here: https://github.com/eclipse/birt-website/tree/BIRT-logo%26icon/static/img/birt-logo%26icon


The logo and icon are designed with  “Inkscape” and “photopea” as they are free of costs. I guess that not everybody uses the adobe tools or wants to use them as they are quite expensive.

The file starting with an underscore “_” are the original SVG files. As some programs have problems reading Inscape original SVG format I saved 2 different SVG formats. I tested them with edge and firefox.

As requested I saved logo and icon in different resolutions in pixels and colour bit depth as PNG file format. The background is transparent.

If you have any problem don’t hesitate and get in touch with me.

>>>>>>>>>>>
Since BIRT v.4.7 (and still in v4.8) the generated Pdf file ignores the height defined in the Report Editor.

This problem affects about 57 report by us.

The root cause is the change from commit f84d0f812a72ba8e54f6caf641e16442d480594c
to the TableLayout class in org.eclipse.birt.report.engine bundle. (I was not able to find any bug ticket related to this commit).

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Same issue in 4.9 release candidate. Fixed layout reports rely on row height honored especially when rows are empty as this approach allows to achieve desired layout for pre-printed forms like checks, w-2s, pre-formatted bills or any other reports where fixed/exact presentation is critical.

This is serious, critical issue which makes upgrade from 4.6 to any latest version impossible. 

Seems to be broken in PDF only. All other formats like html, excel, docx and ppt are Ok. But pdf is the most accurate and important format therefore that must  be be supported. Not to mention now you have different output for html vs pdf. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The problem introduced in https://github.com/eclipse/birt/commit/f84d0f812a72ba8e54f6caf641e16442d480594c


class org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.nLayout.area.impl.TableLayout

line 850-851:
// Do not use specified height if row is empty to avoid endless page break
int sheight = isEmptyRow( rowArea ) ? 0 : rowArea.getSpecifiedHeight( );
int height = sheight;


Should be 
int sheight = rowArea.getSpecifiedHeight( );
int height = sheight;

Then it works fine (as before). Maybe you need to set height to 0 only when layout is NOT fixed, e.g.:
int sheight = (!isFixedLayout && isEmptyRow( rowArea )) ? 0 : rowArea.getSpecifiedHeight( );
int height = sheight;","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/696/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This works, 1603 tests had been executed.

-  I had to change java environment from java17 back to java11, maybe launch configuration should be changed in repo as well

- I wondered that all the tests had been completed within 6 seconds. That seems fast.

Model tests are mostly in memory. Output is irrelevant as long as the tests are green. Failure testing is performed.

No idea, 10%?

I looked at your video and understand how to create a fork.  But please excuse my ignorance.  What's not clear is how work with that in Eclipse.  I found this question with a description:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53024406/how-to-work-on-a-project-fork-when-having-the-original-in-eclipse

So I think I could follow those instructions (add a remote to pushes to my fork URI) but is this really the simplest/correct approach?

My concern is that I make a bunch of changes, commit them to my fork, but maybe I forget something and then I have multiple commits.  Will multiple commits be a problem?  

Also, what happens if someone commits other changes after I have forked?  How can I rebase my fork/branch if that happens?

After all these years of learning from you, I'm happy to return the favor. :)

> but is this really the simplest/correct approach?

Yes, after you have already cloned the main repo, this is the easiest approach. Detailed steps are:

* Fork birt main repo to your own account on the Github website
* git remote add fork https://github.com/merks/birt.git
* git remote -v

If you did not already clone the master birt repo then you should just clone your fork:

* git clone https://github.com/merks/birt.git

### Will multiple commits be a problem?
Just make sure you put all your commits in a topic branch and you can push as many commits as you like. After you made a pull request, even pushes after that will be automatically added to the pull request.

We can squash before we do the final merge.

### what happens if someone commits other changes after I have forked
The easiest way is to go to your fork on the GitHub website and rebase your forked repository. Then fetch and merge/rebase locally.

As a non-english developer and user I think that only texts *inside the IDE* should be translated, whereas all those text that only occur *at runtime* (debug, warning, info, error messages) should strictly *not* be translated.

The reasoning behind this is: If you are not a developer, then those texts are all gibberish for your anyway. 

I know this from ~30 years.  experience. Only in a handful of cases has any of our users understood the root cause of a stack trace.

Those messages are understandable only for developers. And even then, you often have to search the internet for more information. Since we don't have unique message ids (such like ORA-01403 for Oracle databases with the meaning ""No data found"" or ""Keine Daten gefunden"" in German), it would be counter-productive to have a e.g. a German translation. Developers are expected to understand a basic subset of English anyway, and when searching the internet, the chances to find some useful information are much higher with an english search phrase.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc496gwH/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I found that when I selected most of the options, it reduced the total number of warnings from 81959 to 72005, a reduction of 9954 warnings.  Most of those options probably didn't fix any warnings, but they did change a lot of files.  The ones that I can tell fix warnings are 
Change non static accesses to static members using declaring type
Change indirect accesses to static members to direct accesses (accesses through subtypes)
Remove unused imports
Remove unused private methods
Remove unused private constructors
Remove unused private types
Remove unused private fields
Remove unused local variables
If I set just those it reduces the total number of warnings to 74643, a reduction of 7316.  So some of the others are also fixing warnings but I can't tell which ones.

`
This was caused by ""Convert functional interface instances"" in ""Java Feature""
After deselecting that clean-up it succeeded but now there are 43 errors in the code

It seems some of these clean-ups are less then perfect.  For example, it converted
`fontAttribs.put(TextAttribute.SIZE, new Float(fd.getSize() * getDpiResolution() / 72d));`
to
`fontAttribs.put(TextAttribute.SIZE, Float.valueOf((float) fd.getSize() * getDpiResolution() / 72d));`
but since it didn't add parentheses, the cast didn't work and the value passed to valueOf was a double.

In another instance it converted an inner class to static but didn't change the instantiation so it was still being instantiated as an instance member of the parent object.

I'm going to have to disable clean-ups until I can eliminate all the errors.

The ""Replace String concatenation by StringBuilder"" clean up converts

```
	public String getDisplayLabel(Module module, int level) {
		String displayLabel = super.getDisplayLabel(module, level);
		if (level == IDesignElementModel.FULL_LABEL) {
			String name = getStringProperty(module, IReportItemModel.DATA_SET_PROP);
			name = limitStringLength(name);
			if (!StringUtil.isBlank(name)) {
				displayLabel += ""("" + name + "")""; //$NON-NLS-1$//$NON-NLS-2$
			}
		}
		return displayLabel;
	}
```

to

```
	@Override
	public String getDisplayLabel(Module module, int level) {
		StringBuilder displayLabel = new StringBuilder().append(super.getDisplayLabel(module, level));
		if (level == IDesignElementModel.FULL_LABEL) {
			String name = getStringProperty(module, IReportItemModel.DATA_SET_PROP);
			name = limitStringLength(name);
			if (!StringUtil.isBlank(name)) {
				displayLabel.append(""("").append(name).append("")""); //$NON-NLS-1$//$NON-NLS-2$
			}
		}
		return displayLabel.toString();
	}
```

The old implementation will return null if super.getDisplayLabel() returns null and level != IDesignElementModel.FULL_LABEL , and the new implementation will return ""null"" under the same circumstances.

This is of cause suspicious code to begin with since the original code will throw a NPE if super.getDisplayLabel() returns null and level == IDesignElementModel.FULL_LABEL. but it is not a good sign that the clean up changes the behavior of the method.

I was initially very optimistic about these ""automatic clean-ups"" but I am starting to get scared instead.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc4-hKpX/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If a report contains a ""large"" grid (say, 10x10), then the following workflow slows down the UI:

Selecting (for example) the top-left cell.
With the keyboard (shift-right, shift-down) select adjacent cells.
This gets slower and slower with each additional row or column selected.

I think the problem is related to the outline view. At least I can see that the view gets updated and during this update it scrolls around.

On my machine, this easily results in > 3 seconds response time for each addditional row or column.

When one call .setSelection(IStructuredSelection) on a TreeViewer the TreeItems is revealed during the selection of them. However, if the selection is unchanged, meaning that it is the same as the existing one, the items will not be revealed automatically. This means if the user has collapsed the tree after the selection was set, the items will not be revealed if the user selects the objects in the GEF viewer again directly afterwards.

However, since BIRT synchronizes the selection of the outline tree viewer and the GEF viewer, selections are rarely the same.
I tried to enforce this problem in BIRT after I made the change but I did not succeed.

Sometimes, I just can't see why the page-breaking behaves different from what I expect after very carefully looking at the page-breaking properties of each report item in the UI. Most of the times, the reason is the person sitting in front of the screen...

I think this is one of the general problems with using Java from Javascript and vice versa. 

Of course this already is a problem with the existing JS integration. 

In many cases it is not quite clear if an object is a Javscript string or a Java string. Then what is the meaning of the replace method, for example?

Quite often, I have some logic which uses string objects which may be JS or Java (some of them columns from a data set, some are the result of some other logic, and some are Java objects (results columns of direct JDBC access). As a best practice(?), I tend to use the construct `"""" + x` to convert x to a JS string object or new java.lang.String(x) to convert x to a Java string object.

Does anyone know about backward compatibility of Rhino releases?

Should a report contain a property specifying the intended ECMAScript release? It seems like Rhino can be configured somehow in this regard, see the remark ""requires VERSION_ES6 or -version 200 flag"" at the top of https://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html.

But in addition to SteveSchafer an idea. Would it be possible to have both JS-engines Rhino & GraalJS on BIRT.
The additional idea would be that we would have 2 configuration options of compatibility of existing reports.
1 configuration define the default engine on global level to use ""Rhino"" or ""GraalJS"" and 1 configuration option on report level so that the report developer can switch on report level between the both engines and overwrite the global settings with this configuration.

So we would have a solution of the current reports and a modern engine for new / modernised reports.

Would it be an option to go this double-engine-way?

### Re-exporting
The original authors of BIRT used re-exporting dependencies. This is now considered not ideal. Each plugin should define its own dependencies and not inherit them through another dependency. 
For example, the BIRT core plugin re-exports org.eclipse.core.runtime. This means that any client of birt core does not have to depend on org.eclipse.core.runtime because it gets it for free from birt core. Re-exporting makes the dependency chain unclear.

### RHINO is re-exported by birt.core
One of the re-exported plugins is org.mozilla.javascript ([the RHINO engine](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino)).  It is re-exported by o.e.birt.core and o.e.birt.data. This means that BIRT is hooked into this implementation.

However, when removing the re-export, only a handful of plugins and around 20 classes showed errors. This means that we should be able to refactor this with some effort.

### Refactoring
To refactor this so we can use any scripting engine, we should not rely on org.mozilla.javascript directly but acquire it through the standard script engine classes of Java.

#### Rhino
ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(""rhino"");
engine.eval(""print('Hello World!');"");

#### Graal
ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(""graal.js"");
engine.eval(""print('Hello World!');"");

#### Nashorn
ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(""nashorn"");
engine.eval(""print('Hello World!');"");

### Getting started
1. Startup a birt development environment.
2. Remove the Mozilla dependencies in org.eclipse.birt.core and org.eclipse.birt.data
3. Fix the errors

I prefer the swith options like my comment before.

But we have another point hvbtup noted the relevant detail and his discussion with #1138 and I had same problem with another context #1160.

The topic is till JDK 8 the usage of ""javax""- , ""com sun.*""- classes are no problem with rhino and the usage on report context.
Since JDK 9 till 11 the usage is possible but with warnings.
Since JDK 16 the usage of such classes is not longer possible and the reports will crash.

The reason is the JVM-module-system which was started with JDK 9. Our used BIRT rhino engine in version 1.17.10 isn't able to use it correctly. The newest version 1.17.14 fix sume issues on it (but not all).

So it seems that we will get an issue with older reports based on the historical Java usage if we cannot solve the problem
through a new rhino version or our switch handling of alternative Script-engines.

GraalVS allows to select the ES version as well (https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/js/JavaScriptCompatibility/)

I also saw that Rhino only supports a small (but very useful) subset of the ES 6 features.

I still think it is important to take the ES version into account.
So, in rptdesign and rptlibrary file, there should be an option to specify the ES version that this module uses.
The default value would be ES 5.
When a module loads a library, it should be checked that their ES versions match, otherwise there should be an error.

Regarding switching to a different JS implementation, e.g. GraalVM or Nashorn, I'm unopinionated.
However, https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/js/RhinoMigrationGuide/  says that probably the JS source code has to be changed here and there in existing reports, so this would be a *breaking change*.

I'm using Maven 3.6.1 instead of 3.6.3 - However, I don't think this is related to the issue.

It sounds like a candidate for being the reason.

On my machine,  we are using GData Antivirus, and unfortunately the second start is as slow as the first one.
BTW I don't see this issue when starting the Oomph generated eclipse for development *of* BIRT.
But maybe this is because those JARs are well-known to the Anti-Virus software.

And a final remark: Inside the bug you mentioned, someone created a patch to use buffered IO, but that was abandoned, which is a pity.
I think this could make a big difference performance-wise.

I also let ProcMon watch the OS calls from javaw.exe during the start, and this didn't show anything interesting (but again, I'm not an expert here).

My gut feeling tells me this is an issue with Apache Felix and it has nothing to do with antivirus software (at least in my case).

The word ""permutation"" in the source code of Felix ResolverImpl makes me (coming from mathematics) think there is an inevitable general problem (regarding CPU time and memory consumption) if there are many plugins(?).

I found this: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=571908
and this: https://groups.google.com/g/bndtools-users/c/2u7s7xdWgTo

One of the commenters (BJ Hargrave) in the Google Groups discussion said:

""The resolver has a hard problem to solve (I believe Glyn Normington demonstrated it to be NP-complete; see SAT solvers)""

This is directly related to my concern regarding the permutations.

How can I determine which release of the Felix resolver BIRT is using?
And could we try to use a newer release?

And as shown in the Google Gruops discussion, the problem may be related to the bundling somehow (again, as JB Hargrave said: ""That is also what I am talking about.

By chance, I found out that I can avoid the slow startup time for subsequent starts by removing the ""-clean"" argument.

These observations were confirmed by a colleague with a new computer.

To sum it up:

1) The first start takes very long.
2) Subsequent starts take very long if the ""-clean"" argument is present.

The reason for 2) is the Felix ResolverImpl and its NP-complexity.
The reason for 1) is the same + possibly the antivirus software.

I never had any trouble with ""-clean"" with BIRT 4.2.1. It only caused 1-2 or seconds extra startup time (that's why I added this to my start script by default), whereas now it causes 2 minutes extra startup time.

Unfortunately, this did not solve my performance issue.
Reason:
BIRT's dataSet cache is query based instead of data based.
While this might fit nicely for database datasets, it does not solve my issue because I am using different xpath parameters for each dataSet access, causing the query to differ and in consequence, getting a cache miss.

What we would need here is a data cache - to fit the data source (in my case the 300 kb xml) in memory so that it only needs to be parsed once and executing the actual, individual query at the data stored in the cache.
By looking further at the architecture, it seems to be difficult to solve without doing major changes to the data execution subsystem.

Yes. This prevents costly/slow queries to be sent to the database again - it is a very important performance feature.

We're already assigning unique identifier to parent rows to mitigate the fact the BIRT does not provide full XPath support.

You're right that a custom ""XML to Java Object-Transformator"" would solve most of the performance problems.
However, this has to be done by every BIRT XML-DataSet user who is interested in performance (who's not?).
Instead, we should think about if we can do better in BIRT as XML support is for me a common use case.

Ideally, we should think about using an alternative XML DataSource, e.g. a DOM-based one (of course, the users need to be careful when dealing with large xmls) and use standard JAXP-Features (e.g. XPath) executed on the DOM-tree instead of SAX-oriented parsing and custom xpath code.

A couple of months a ago, when preparing the sample project and collecting profiling data,
I did some analysis but when I realized that the data source code base is quite complicated and full of surprising dependencies, I postponed this. 
IMHO, the datasource/ODA part of BIRT needs proper refactoring.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5AkjrI/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I'd like to add that XML is an overkill format for data serialization in comparison to eg JSON.
But XML ist still used a lot. OTOH, processing really big XML files seems not a reasonable use case IMHO - independent of the choice of tools and libraries.

The code base is definitely complicated - and not only the data engine part.

But let's face it: 
Until now, only you and I are particiating in this issue. And XML support is not important to me.
So if you want to improve it, you should try it yourself.

Your idea with a DOM-based XML data source sounds quite reasonable to me.
If I understand correctly, you mean that the XML is parsed _once_ when the data source is opened. The data source then presents a DOM to the data sets.
The data set can then use the DOM to navigate to those parts of the data in which it is interested.

It will need more memory to hold the DOM representation, but it should reduce processing time dramatically.

Even DOM is overkill in many case IMHO. 
There's also StAX and several different approaches in Java (see https://www.baeldung.com/java-xml). 
When processing XML with Python, I'm using ElementTree, which is more light-weight, and I always tried to avoid dealing with XML in Java, so I can't help much anyway.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5AoEsx/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I can tell you that iText is very deeply integrated with BIRT - and not only with the PDF emitter. In fact, it seems that BIRT uses iText functions to calculate text widths etc.

Thus, OpenPDF is the only possible alternative to iText.

I was concerned about possible legal issues, but I recently I found that open source software from the EU (to be more specific: the ""Digital Signature Service"") also uses OpenPDF, so I think that possible legal issues are probably not a problem. 

Nevertheless, before deciding to use OpenPDF, a legal expert should take a look at this. Can the Eclipse foundation help here?

My reasoning was that OpenPDF is a fork from a version of iText, that uses MPL/LGPL, the. It has with the same license as the iText we currently using. Any legal issues with OpenPDF should apply to the version of iText that we are using. But I am probably naive regarding this.

The code there looks slightly suspicious to me.
I mean, will it have the desired effect of actually freeing memory in Java 17 without sun.misc.Unsafe and without reflection? The exceptions are just ignored.
Couldn't this result in the process eating up all RAM if it processing PDFs for a long time?

But anyway, that would be an OpenPDF issue, not ours.

i can confirm that OpenPDF works great as a iText replacement. Until now, i did not have any issues (and also no Illegal reflective access messages).

I also wondered about the legal issue: my understanding is that iText became commercial only on later versions and not on the old iText 4 (i believe) the work OpenPDF is based on.

CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

Severity: Critical

Base CVSS Score: 10.0 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Versions Affected: all log4j-core versions >=2.0-beta9 and <=2.14.1

Descripton: Apache Log4j <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.

Mitigation: In releases >=2.10, this behavior can be mitigated by setting either the system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups or the environment variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to true. For releases >=2.7 and <=2.14.1, all PatternLayout patterns can be modified to specify the message converter as %m{nolookups} instead of just %m. For releases >=2.0-beta9 and <=2.10.0, the mitigation is to remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class.

Another report (which uses the DOCX emitter instead of the PDF emitter failed with a similar error in the stacktrace while trying to load the JDBC driver.

### Has anybody successfully tested the (non-osgi) runtime?

Note: 

Generating reports worked with Java 8 and my fork hvbtup/birt (branch flugtiger-master).

I've performed the process of building BIRT (using Maven) and using the generated birt-runtime-4.*.zip several times and never had any problems until now, thus I am pretty sure that my environment variables etc. are ok.
The number and size of the jar files in reportengine/lib seems to be ok as well.

The difference is that now I am using the eclipse/master trunk (after the ""BIRT reboot"") and Java 11 instead of Java 8.

In case of PDFPageDevice.java we know exactly what bundle is searched, because the error happens in this line:

```
	protected static String[] versionInfo = new String[] {
			BundleVersionUtil.getBundleVersion(""org.eclipse.birt.report.engine"") };

```

As a side note, launching ""BIRT all-in-one.launch"" and previewing reports from the launched ""Report-All-In-One"" designer works like a charm. 
The only thing I had to adjust to make it work was to check an entry for OSGI in the .launch file:

**Can someone please confirm that the BIRT runtime (generated fresh from master) is working with Java 11 or tell me what's wrong here?**

**Preparation: Compile and ""install""**

Use MVN package to compile and package everything.

You'll find a ZIP file birt-runtime-4.9.0-2022*.zip in build\birt-packages\birt-runtime\target

Unzip this to a new directory, say c:\runtime-test.

You now have a structure like this:

**Preparation: Fix the generated script**

Use a text editor to fix the file C:\runtime-test\ReportEngine\genReport.bat:

These lines ...

```
REM set the birt class path.
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
set BIRTCLASSPATH=
for %%i in (%WORK_DIR%\lib\*.jar) do set BIRTCLASSPATH=%%i;!BIRTCLASSPATH!
```
... must be replaced with this:

`set BIRTCLASSPATH=%WORK_DIR%\lib\*`

A few lines below, change this line ...

`SET JAVACMD=java`

to something like ...

`SET JAVACMD=C:\prog\jdk\jdk-11.0.13+8\bin\java.exe`

to make sure that Java 11 and no other Java version is used. Of course you need to adapt this to where your Java 11 is.

**Test the POJO runtime**

Use the command line (cmd.exe, not PowerShell) and CD into the ReportEngine directory, then enter this command:

`genReport.bat -m runrender -f PDF samples\hello_world.rptdesign`

And you'll get a wonderful stack trace:

Unfortunately I don't know his GitHub account. I'd be interested if he has made any progress yet.

For the PDFPAgeDevice.java error, it is interesting to note that the error happens in **static initialization** code. 

_AFAIK static variables are considered bad practice with OSGI !?_ 

So maybe this can be fixed by somehow avoiding this static initialization.

But I think this is not the whole truth, because when I am using the Word emitter in out application, I get a similar error later, when BIRT tries to load the JDBC driver (which is contained in the class-path).

I'm not so much a Java insider (the times when I used Java every day were back in the last century), but it seems to me this regression is caused by some changes in the class loading mechanism, either between Java 8 and 11 or between the older and newer Eclipse core framework.

By chance, I found a message here https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1104321/ where Sascha Müller said that he had built BIRT and made it work in June 2020 - and someone else replied that it didn't work for him or her - with exactly this ExceptionInInitalizationError in PDFPageDevice.java! Probably Sascha's Eclipse doesn't use the POJO runtime.

I forked hvbtup/birt from flugtiger/birt (branch flugtiger_master) before October 2019, then I merged from flugtiger/birt on May 22, 2020. The POJO runtime of my fork is working fine in production use.

This make me think that this issue is caused by some changes between flugtiger/birt (flugtiger_master) as of 2020-05-22 and the code Sascha Müller used for https://github.com/SaMuellerDLR/birt (he also forked from flugtiger/birt).
These changes could be inside the BIRT source code or caused by newer releases of the plugins, e.g. the Eclipse core.

I can see that the files are more or less the same (some differences caused by timestamps in the filenames)
There are some differences in some xml and properties files inside JAR files.
A lot of differences in class files, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the code is actually different.

- You have to make a tiny change in your code (see #787)
- The disk (and maybe memory) footprint is significantly bigger.
- The OSGI runtime creates log files and lots of other files in ReportEngine\platform\configuration and who knows where else?
- E.g. ReportEngine\platform\configuration\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.manager contains several .tmp*.instance files.
So this definitely needs additional house-keeping work.
- Lots of error messages on stderr on startup (see #787)

An additional problem might arise if an application uses the BIRT OSGI runtime from several processes (like we do).
I tried specifying system properties to make each BIRT process use a separate directory:

-DBIRT_HOME=E:\reporting\jlib\birt\v490_osgi_20220123\ReportEngine\platform
-Dosgi.locking=none

-Dosgi.configuration.area=E:\reporting\temp\birt-2\configuration
-Dosgi.instance.area=E:\reporting\temp\birt-2\workspace

(I googled for these properties)

Before I start the BIRT process, I created the E:\reporting\temp\birt-2 directory and copied the structure from birt-runtime-osgi-4.9.0-20220123.zip\ReportEngine\platform\configuration to E:\reporting\temp\birt-2\configuration.

In the process, I use the BIRT_HOME property to call engineConfig.setEngineHome.

Despite the osgi.configuration.area setting, BIRT creates .manager directories with *.instance files under E:\reporting\jlib\birt\v490_osgi_20220123\ReportEngine\platform\configuration.

Meanwhile I tried to find out how to cope with the OSGI runtime.

I did not find any way to direct the .manager directories etc to a different location than ReportEngine/platform/configuration.
So I set that whole directory read-only, and I can still generate reports.
I don't know, however, if this restricts functionality somehow or if the runtime will create those files somewhere else. 
IMHO the OSGI runtime is still not a reasonable solution if BIRT shall run in several parallel processes (as a service on an application server).

So I'll wait until 2022/03 and hope that the POJO runtime will work then.

Will this prevent us from a new BIRT release then? 

Or should we release nevertheless and only mention that the POJO runtime isn't working at the moment, but will come with the next release then?

Maybe you can convert that question into a discussion? You have to be careful not to pollute issues with side questions too much. It makes it very hard to keep an overview.

Please start with a discussion first so that we can then make separate issues.

- The second parameter P_GSIZE is intended for switching between small and big header image output.

- P_KOPF conrols the gap on next pages between page top and start of the content.

We use the report runtime `org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.9.0-20190523` for test purposes in the server attached to our ERP system:
The eclipse build info of states:

```
Eclipse Platform
Version: 2021-12 (4.22)
Build id: I20211124-1800
OS: Windows 10, v.10.0, x86_64 / win32
Java vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java runtime version: 17.0.1+12-39
Java version: 17.0.1
```

As I started the designer application today, it executes updates (some of ...2022-03... I think).

Our production system runs on version `org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.3.2.v20140225-1404` - in this version we are not facing this problem.

I attached a stand-alone version of the test report which is using the Sample DB.
[birttest.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/birt/files/7913034/birttest.zip)
As you can see in `test_preview_eclipse_ok.pdf` the report doesn't break - but the content of the masterpage header is covered.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc48tDGH/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

With a BIRT 4.2.1 All-In-One-Designer the report looks like test_preview_eclipse_ok.pdf.

The lorem ipsum text is truncated between the bottom of page 1 and the top of page 2, but I think this is what is intended.

Then I tested the report from the All-In-One-Designer which I built from the GitHub sources a few days ago.
And I could not reproduce your problem - it does not crash and the report looks the same as with BIRT 4.2.1

You said that you are using org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.9.0-20190523.
This is quite old - probably the bug has been fixed already.
It might be related to some older bugfix which introduced new problems and which I reverted somewhere after 2019.

So you should try with the current BIRT sources from GitHub.
But be warned, it is not yet perfect, e.g. the POJO runtime doesn't work at the moment.
You can help improving this situation by contributing :-)

As a side note: 
I said that we are using the same trick. But we do it only for the first page.
Like you, we are using

to hide the header on the first page. In the layout, we are using a negative top-margin for the top-most layout element, which in our case is a separate object that only is displayed once (at the beginning of the layout.

What we don't do is to use a negative margin for layout objects on subsequent pages, and we don't set the margin dynamically in the onCreate event. So we are not exactly in the same situation.

Well, I tried to use the OSGI runtime in our application, but now I am facing a different issue.

If I understand correctly, in order to switch the application code from POJO to OSGI runtime, the following steps are necessary:

Download the OSGI runtime instead of the POJO runtime (of course).
The ZIP structure is basically the same, but the OSGI ZIP contains an additional folder ReportEngine\platform.

In the startup code, add a line

    engineConfig.setBIRTHome(birt_home); 

where birt_home is the path to ReportEngine\platform 
before calling

    Platform.startup(engineConfig);

Without this modification the startup is not working.

Now I am facing this issue:

Cannot open the connection for the driver: org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.
...
Caused by: org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.JDBCException: **Missing properties in Connection.open(Properties).**
	at org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.Connection.open(Connection.java:134)

	at org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.odaconsumer.ConnectionManager.openConnection(ConnectionManager.java:153)
	... 27 more

Note: My setup - which always worked with the POJO runtime so far - is as follows.

The reports are using an Oracle JDBC data source.
This data source definition is defined in a library lisa_basis.rptlibrary.
The reports (and all other libraries) are referencing the data source from the library.

The data source definition of lisa_basis.rptlibrary contains fake connection data, the actual properties are then supplied by the calling code as system properties when BIRT runtime is used - or as environment variables when the All-In-One designer is used:

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644776/150797471-6d53eb98-ec6b-48ac-9738-6e5cc6ebb195.png)

lisa.getProperty(...) is defined in a *.js ressource and is just a thin wrapper around System.getProperty.

It seems that is no longer sufficient to have the ojdbc8.jar (Oracle JDBC driver) in the class path.
I also tried copying that file into ReportEngine\platform\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc_4.9.0.v202201232020\drivers and specifying the path to that file in the appContext. The exception traceback stays the same.

The same code in the same environment works if I change the flollowing:
- Don't set BIRT_HOME 
- Use the POJO runtime (from the hvbtup/birt (flugtiger_master) instead of the OSGI runtime from eclipse/birt
- Use Java 8 instead of 11

I forgot to copy one of our JARs to the ReportEngine/lib directory.
This caused the logic in the data source property bindings to ""think"" that the report is running in the all-in-one designer and thus expecting the properties as environment variables instead of system properties, resulting in null properties.

So this is issue can be closed.
The effort was not in vain, though, because in my comments I described the tiny changes that are necessary to migrate a POJO runtime program to an OSGI runtime program ;-)

BTW, when I captured stderr, I found that the OSGI runtime produces lots of error messages on startup as described here: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=547526

Claes is working on replacing iText with OpenPDF (see https://github.com/eclipse/birt/pull/780), so hopefully this issue will be solved once that is done.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/793/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **colinsutton** February  2, 2022</sup>
I have successfully built BIRT on Windows and on Macos.cocoa.x86_64 on one of my intel macs.
I notice that the macos all-in-one zip file in the latest builds ""Artifacts of birt-master #159"" is damaged, won't extract (I downloaded a couple of times in case there was a transient error, but it still won't create an eclipse app). 

When I build BIRT on the m1 using eclipse for the m1 it has the error  in manifest line 6 with ""org.eclipse.birt.data.oda.pojo.ui cannot be resolved"". Is this caused by use of JRE17 (this is the JDK version that supports aarch64). If i delete line 6 it builds everything OK for the intel platforms only.

Is there a plan to add support for macos.cocoa.aarch64? I built the eclipse dev environment which supports m1 macs, but BIRT does not yet know about AARCH64. Maybe for the release after next? </div>","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/810/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It should link to this:

And the fact that the uppercase link /BIRT/ does not work on eclipse.org is a pity. Can this be changed?

Apart from these details, your question is one of those that I ask myself.

It seems that hardly anyone watches the new website for PRs.
But at the same time, it seems very important to change this to make the new website ""alive"".

For example, when I could not sleep last night, I thought about creating some example reports explaining single features or special topics. Originally I played with the idea of writing a new book about BIRT (since e.g. ""BIRT - A Field Guide"" is no longer available, and in BIRT teaching sessions, the learners often ask for a printed tutorial in German). But the rate between effort and potential commercial success seems to speak against the book idea.

So I think about _where_ should I place example reports, short tutorials for advanced topics etc?
I could do this in the hvbtup/birt wiki but OTOH I want to reserve that to merely explain the differences to eclipse/birt.

The natural place for tutorials and examples would be a wiki on the new website.
But as long as reasonable PRs take weeks to be applied, this will prevent people from developing the wiki, and the wiki cannot really be called a wiki.

So: Who is responsible for merging PRs on the website?

I think it is very important to further improve the online documentation and (as a side effect) demonstrate that the project is alive. An improved documentation can also reduce the number of beginner questions significantly, I hope.

One thing that is lacking is a feature list, a description of what BIRT can do and what BIRT cannot do. For layout, there should be a table like this for the most important emitters (I :

| Feature | PDF | HTML | DOCX | XLSX | See note |
|---------|-----|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Drop: Detail: | YES | ? | NO | NO | 1 |
| Barcodes | Yes* | Yes* | Yes* | Yes* | 2 |
| 2D-Codes (QR, DataMatrix etc) | Yes* | Yes* | Yes* | Yes* | 2 |

Yes* means: Not natively supported, but reasonable workaround are available.

1) Drop Detail can be specified for *cells* in table group header rows. It means that the cell should ""drop"" down into the first detail row. Normally this only make senses when specified for all non-empty cells of the row. For perfect alignment, carefully adjust border and padding properties of the header cell and the detail cell (more explanation necessary).
and footnotes where necessary. AFAIK does not work with Word or Excel export. Also note that Word doesn't have a concept for table group header rows at all. See [drop_detail] for more details.

2) BIRT <= 4.9 does not support Barcodes or 2D-Codes like QR-Codes or DataMatrix-Codes.
However, it relatively easy to work around this limitation. The idea is to use any Java (or possible old-style JS) library that can generate a barcode or 2D-code for a given text as an image file. For example, zxing can be used. The necessary JAR files have to be in the class path (for the designer, see Preferences / Report Design / Class Path, for POJO runtime or OSGI runtime in the class path, eg. inside ReportEngine/lib). Use a dynamic image item in the layout. Use Javascript to call the Java library and create a byte array. Use this as the source for the image data (example needed). If the image MIME type is set correctly, this even works for generating SVG images. For some 1D codes (like Code-39 oder Code-128), an easier alternative can be to use a special TrueType font.

We are still a small team.

I think it is necessary to clearly divide questions about how to use BIRT from enhancement proposals and bug reports.
Otherwise we will drown in a flood of new issues.
The first address for questions should be to look at the wiki and (my personal opinion: ) stackoverflow.com.
If a question comes up frequently, the topic should be added to the wiki.

Pure usage questions should go into birt/discussions, not into birt/issues. The categories that we have in discussions are sufficient, I think. 
Is is possible to create kind of a ""header"" for issues and for discussions or top ""pin"" entries?
It would be nice if basic instructions (about where to post, usage of tags, and that noone can demand help, but everone is invited to help) would be visible at first glance.

2. edit the file ""platform/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info"" and to add this line to the end of the file:

When running such a report with BIRT 4.9, the defined properties such as separator, maximum length etc are ignored and the default values are uses (an empty separator and a maximum length of 1000).

This results in incorrect output.

                        </structure>

Note that ampersands (to mark the keyboard shortcut key) are present in the old file, but no longer in the new file.

At runtime, the implementation is looking for the ""Separator"" property but can't find it.

This can only be solved by manually ""migrating"" the existing rptdesign files to the new format.

Of course, the new format is better, but the necessity of manual migrating existing reports is a PITA.

Question:
Is there a migration guide - or a migration tool?
Does anybody know if there are other such issues?

Hence, this is a very old and perhaps not very big problem.

One place to do a ""silent on-the-fly migration"" is in org.eclipse.birt.report.data.adapter.internal.adapter.ComputedColumnAdapter when the arguments are populated, but there may, and hopefully, be better places.

However, the fix will be a ugly hack and may not always work since the old names of these parameters were translated into different languages. Before the fix in 2014, a report design created in France would not work in Spain. The old, problematic, behavior would affect the ""silent migration fix"" so every translation of these parameters would need to be check and migrated to the new parameter names for such a fix to be robust. 

I will see if I can find a cleaner way to solve this.

In this case it seems that the CONCATENATE aggragate function was the only one affected. That's good to know.

Regarding ""Hence, this is a very old and perhaps not very big problem."" - There are still many users working with even older BIRT releases than 4.3. Often they say that they can't switch to a newer release for whatever reason. Probably one big reason to not use a newer BIRT release was that BIRT was in effect broken during the last few years - which we will change now :)
So we we might face many questions regarding ""what do I have to do to switch from BIRT 3.7, 4.2, 4.3, ... to BIRT 4.9?

The aforementioned commit was a breaking change. I don't know if this has been mentioned anywhere in the old release notes.

I'll close this issue as it is easy to migrate old *.rptdesign files to the new format (as you described in your comment https://github.com/eclipse/birt/issues/838#issuecomment-1050893513) and instead create a new issue for missing documentation.

When running reports with BIRT 4.9.0 runtime, we found an issue regarding the CONCATENATE function (see #838).

Years ago, when we switched from BIRT 4.2.1 to 4.3.0 runtime, we had an issue with the changed default of 10.000 for the row prefetch size (the old Oracle JDBC driver ran into OOM immediately then).

I mean, there are always some details to keep in mind when switching to a new software release - in our case: BIRT.

We should have a dedicated page for this topic in the Wiki.

The Image-Item works with embedded and external resources, but this is not a good option for us, because we have to change many big reports.

### Steps to reproduce:

Using runtime org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.9.0-20220308

• Create an empty report with a grid item.

_• Optional: Add a report variable ""X"" with contains the `<PATH TO YOUR SVG>`_

• In the OnCreate-Script of the Grid-Cell put following line:

`this.getStyle().backgroundImage=""<PATH-TO-YOUR-SVG>"";`

Replace `<PATH-TO-YOUR-SVG>` with your own SVG file.

_Optional: `this.getStyle().backgroundImage=vars[""X""];`_

• Run the report

### Comment:

In the old runtime org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.3.2.v20140225-1404 which runs on JRE8 it all worked fine.

When creating PDF output, an SVG used as background image (e.g. for a page) is missing (without an error being reported).
Creating an SVG as an image does work. The difference is that the latter is included in the PDF as vector graphics, whereas BIRT wants to render the background image to a (low-res) bitmap.

When I add the file org.apache.batik.codec_1.14.0.v20210324-0332.jar to ReportEngine/lib (and thus to the class-path), it works.

About the different runtimes: AFAIK the code base is exactly the same. The difference seems to be just a single environment variable (BIRT_HOME IIRC), which is used to decide in the code to switch to OSGI mode or not.

I actually did that first, but then I remembered the ""master is open for 4.10 development"" statement and I thought that 4.24-i was more appropriate.
How do we plan to go forth? I foresee 4.9.x releases ( support for SVG is broken in 4.9.0, #865. More bugs will certainly show up ). Should we branch of for 4.9.x ? If so, that branch should use https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.23/ and master could perhaps continue with 4.24-i.
If 4.9.x releases will be done from master, we should for sure change to 4.23 there.

For example, we now build against jetty 10.0.6 but it will run fine when the platform updates to jetty 10.0.8. If we don't follow the minor updates of the platform then BIRT 4.10/11/12/13 will also be installable in Eclipse 4.23

Question is, do we want to follow Eclipse or do we keep targeting Eclipse 4.23 for the next x period.

Targeting Eclipse 4.23 gives adopters some breathing room in building a product that they don't have to update every three months if they need to incorporate new BIRT fixes.

There are many Eclipse-based products that use BIRT (e.g IBM in the rational suite, SAP in their development environment, and probably many others) that can't keep up with this pace.

Maybe we can start a discussion about this with the rest of the team.

The sorry state of Birt the last years has kept our product on older versions of almost all other dependencies and build tools. Also, we have been stuck with old versions of Eclipse since we are using Eclipse IDE report designer when developing reports.

That makes it hard to get rid of the older one with the weak signature unless one ensures the target platform can't see the older one with the qualifier or one specifies the version exactly in the target platform.

How far back would you like the branches cleaned? I know there were 
still some products that used versions as old as 3.7. Should we archive 
these before removing them?

Note to that to build BIRT 3.7, people also have to have access to all the old dependencies from 10 years ago :)

Maybe you can make a fork and stash that somewhere (e.g. on a wiki page) just be on the save side.

One of our reports has a structure like this:
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644776/158799538-b8648320-5fd3-4b65-8f62-306767af6faa.png)
That is, we have a simple master-detail structure (with multiple details).

The table ""Reports"" is bound to a JDBC dataset with the same name.
For each report, there are some detail tables, one of these is table ""Ausgabegeräte"", which is bound to a JDBC dataset with the name.
Some systems call this a ""sub-report"".

The dataset ""Ausgabegeräte"" uses a dataset parameter to select the detail data for the given report from the layout context (DataSet Parameter Binding)
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644776/158800061-2ec3619b-9931-4623-bb1e-190b3eb8a5e7.png)

The datasets contain beforeOpen events just for debugging and performance tuning purposes (showing that the dataSet is about to opened for a given REPT_ID).

This is all very straightforward und it worked for > 10 years.

But now, with BIRT 4.9, the report crashes with ""ORA-01000 too many open cursors"" error message in the exception trace
if I restrict
By using Oracle's tracing tools, I could verify that indeed the cursors for the SQL statements in the reports' datasets are closed only at the end of the report instead of when the processing is done.

I added logging statements to the `afterOpen` and `afterClose` events of the dataset ""Ausgabegeräte"" and this explains the error:

With BIRT 4.3, the sequence of the events was

     afterOpen afterClose
     afterOpen afterClose
     afterOpen afterClose
     ...

but with BIRT 4.9 the sequence is 

    afterOpen afterOpen afterOpen ...
    afterClose afterClose afterClose

**So, the JDBC cursors are freed only at the end of the whole report. It seems like something has changed significantly in the processing.**

Maybe something has changed regarding caching (or options have been renamed or have different default values?)

Note: The report uses `RunAndRenderTask`.

I have not yet tested the fix with application-specific Oracle JDBC report, but I'm pretty sure this will solve the issue - I'll give feedback.

The to-be-reverted commit b86b5466030b8e9b684a8fec17081316f19580c0 comment says 

> Fix to resolve the ""Get page count failed"" error caused while running a report with chart that is based on Join DS from datadesign

It is clear that the commit caused different behavior from what is specified and documented.

As a temporary workaround, I'll use your PR in the tup_main branch of our fork in order to avoid this issue in our product.
We don't use Join Datasets anyway, so that commit fixed something that was never a problem for us.

But for eclipse/birt, I fear that the solution might not be that simple.
I mean, the commit is there to fix an issue for a different usage scenario, so we can hardly just ignore and revert it.
The commit seems to be a rather dirty hack for the issue described in https://forums.opentext.com/forums/developer/discussion/299258/get-page-count-failed-appeared-when-trying-to-move-to-next-page - maybe a different solution is possible?

A relatively simple solution would be to introduce an option to choose at runtime if queryService.close( ) should be called or not.
Then we would have to decide about 
1) where to specify this option and 
2) what the default value should be.

For the first question, it could be set at the Task level or at the report level or both.
From my POV it should suffice to set it at the Task level. Then we wouldn't have to change the ROM.

I'm biased regarding the second question of course: The default value should be ""yes, close the connection"" (as it was until BIRT <= 4.8.0). because a report with a lot of dataset executions seems much more common (from my point of view) than a timeout issue in a report using Join datasets. Join datasets are AFAIK necessary *only* if a report mixes data from 2 or more data sources, which is a small minority of reports, I think.

The commited ""patch"" for the issue described in the forum patch is wrong. The solution to that problem is not to skip closing resources, in this case ultimately: resultsets / database cursors. That .close() method was not called from any place in birt after its removal.

What probably should happen is that if a transient .rptdocument is missing it should be recognized by the caller and it should re-generate the document. An easier/less robust solution would be to increase the ""alive time"" of the report.
Both those solutions would probably be in code which packages start with: com.actuate.

There is already a feature containing this bundle: _org.eclipse.birt.rcp_ in  (features/org.eclipse.birt.rcp.feature) and used - for example - in the birt-packages/birt-report-rcp/BIRT.product.

In the BirtNL category the corresponding _org.eclipse.birt.rcp.nl_ is already there.

...
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException

I can narrow it down to the following binding:

I don't know if that's relevant, but actually the ""AnzahlKarten"" binding is not at all used inside the list item.
So I could fix my report (in this particular case) by just removing the binding ""AnzahlKarten"".

It seems that the problem is related to the fact that the expression to count is not a column from the dataset row.
The issue arises when the expression is a constant expression or row.__rownum.

A general workaround is to count any not-null column instead of row.__rownum or a constant expression.

The very same report with the very same data works with BIRT 4.3.0.

As a side note: The COUNT aggregate is somewhat weird anyway. 
I would expect that it should be possible to use COUNT and COUNTDISTINCT also without an expression.
COUNT should then be the number of rows and COUNTDISTINCT should be the number of distinct rows (considering all columns from the database). That would be in line with the corresponding SQL keywords COUNT and COUNT (DISTINCT ...).

[issue-885.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/birt/files/8409747/issue-885.zip)
Here, I created two tables with a filter condition based on PRODUCTLINE.
The first table filters PRODUCTLINE LIKE ""T%"", the second one PRODUCTLINE LIKE ""X%"".
Otherwise the tables are identical:
The aggregate ""CountRows"" uses COUNT to count row.__rownum.
The visibility expression hides the table if CountRows == 0.
The two tables are identical except for the filter expression.

With BIRT 4.2.1, the output shows only the ""T"" table, with a correct value of 2 for CountRows (Trucks and Trains&Busses).
With BIRT 4.9.0, the report fails,
With the Designer from #914, the output shows _both_ tables, with a value of 1 for CountRows for the X table.

I think it is somewhat debatable what the correct result should be. One might say that in order to ""store"" the CountRows result somewhere, a row is needed, so the result 1 would be correct by that argument.

But the 4.2.1 result is less surprising IMHO.

We had similar issues if the expression to COUNT was a constant (e.g. 1) (don't remember with which BIRT release).

The value of row.__rownum was and still is correct.
A value of -1 indicates that their are no rows at all. 0 is the first row and so on.

COUNT(_x_) should (if I understand correctly) count the not-null - or not-empty?(*) - values of _x_.

(*) For me, in the Oracle world, there is no difference between an empty string and null, so I don't really care.

Insofar row.__rownum is a special case, because for normal columns, the value is probably initialized with null, because ""before the first row"" row.__rownum already has the not-null value -1.

My _intention_ for using COUNT(row.__rownum) was to check if there is any data or not, using it in the visibility expression to hide the whole list/table when there is no data.

I could have done this with with checking for `row.__rownum < 0` in the visibilty expression, of course.
Nevertheless, this has worked with older BIRT versions and I think it is a valid use-case.

I've found this mentioned in https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/848630/ - I even found a comment from me there, reminding me that I reported this as a bug in 2014: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=438257

Obviously, the behavior changed between 4.2.1 and 4.3.0.

Looking at the code in `TotalCount.java` (method onRow in private class MyAcculumator) it seems like just leaving the expression completely empty _should_ work (if `countByColumn` is false, this would work like COUNT(*) in SQL then) - I didn't test it in debug mode though. But as Tom G said in [848630](https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/848630/), that didn't work.

While using `row.__rownum < 0` in the visibiliy expression to hide the table/list when there is no data does work, it is a non-obvious workaround for an essential feature: To hide a table when there is no data is needed in most reports.

I wonder if it would make sense to explicitly allow `*` as an expression for COUNT and COUNTDISTINCT (the latter is much more complicated because it requires to manage a map of the distinct rows so far). But that's only eye-candy. Supporting a correct value of COUNT (and COUNTDISTINCT) for an _empty_ expression should work.

One idea:
Would it be possible to supply a special argument EMPTY_EXPRESSION as args[0] to onRow if the expression is empty?
We could then deal with that in `onRow`. I believe the if-statement for setting `countByColumn` to false in `onRow` is not working because when the expression is empty, it is still supplied null in args[0].

This matches my observations. We skipped 4.2.2 - we were using 4.2.1 before and then used 4.3.0 when we noticed the original issue (""wrong value for COUNT""). Looking at the changes, I really don't understand what's going on there and I also don't find the number 45785 related to BIRT in the old forums or bugzilla (probably this an OpenText internal issue id), but the commit seems to be related.

The reason I wanted to try this new release was in hope of making Hindi fonts working in Birt.
I had seen some posts that suggested the use of itext by Birt was the root cause. I saw itext is now replaced in Birt 4.9.0.
But Hindi font is not working even with the new version of Birt.

OS - mac mojave
Birt - birt-report-designer-all-in-one-4.9.0-20220315-macosx.cocoa.x86_64

**Steps**
------
Create a blank report with a single label.
The label's text is loaded from a resource file.
Run the report. HTML shows the Hindi text  correctly
Change format to pdf in the url or export the report as pdf.
Now the report is empty without any Hindi text in it.

I have testes your case with BIRT 4.8 and BIRT 4.9 on my windows-laptop.
The result is that on default BIRT couldn't find the font for PDF. There was a special configuration which I must set and afterwards the PDF-creation was possible with embedded fonts.

Configuration:
1. go to: C:\BIRT_4.9\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.fonts_4.9.0.v202203150031
2. change file: fontsConfig.xml   e.g. (my case)

&lt;font-paths>
    &lt;path path=""C:/Users/gutma/Downloads/651_devanagari/Hindi-DVSR0ntt.ttf""/>
    &lt;path path=""C:/windows/fonts"" />
    ...
&lt;/font-paths>

After restart of BIRT the configuration will be catched.

For example my test case and the according PDF-document like attachment.
Try it on your side please.

So the reason might have been the following:
You have installed that font on your Mac (note: I don't know anything about the apple parallel universe), but *the TrueType font file landed at some place where the default font configuration does not look*.

The font configuration files are a little bit complicated (but less complicated than those e.g. for Oracle Reports).
AFAIK there are 4 of them:

-  fontsConfig.xml
-  fontsConfig_linux.xml
-  fontsConfig_pdf.xml
-  fontsConfig_win32.xml

... and which of these files are actually used can be confusing.
Note that there is no specialized file for Mac.

You can simplify things a little bit by trying to understand what goes on in a single file, backup the files to a different folder, keep and adapt the file fontsConfig.xml and remove the other 3 files.

A `path` element in `font-paths` can be a single TTF file or a whole directory, e.g.

		<path path=""/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF"" />

In case of a directory, BIRT will scan the directory for *.ttf files.

I had similar issues on newer Windows versions.
In the good old days, when you installed a font in Windows, it was copied to `%WINDIR%\fonts`.
However, things are more complicated nowadays.
I prefer to deploy a directory `fonts` with the ttf files in a known location and adding that known directory as a `path` in `fontsConfig.xml`.

When I developed the first plugin ~ 10 years ago, there was a tutorial and it was not too complicated to create a plugin with the All-in-one-designer. I would have been totally helpless with the SDK then.

When I started with the QR-code plugin, last weekend, I *did* use the SDK - but only because I already have the SDK installed and I didn't want to run *3* Eclipse environments (1=SDK run --> 2=all-in-one for plugin development  debug --> 3=all-in-one to test the plugin). Still, the SDK ist too much for my little brain - I didn't know where to start, so I cloned the sample RotatedText plugin as a workaround.

IMHO it was much easier with the All-in-one environment, where basically you could just choose between creating a report/library/template or a plugin. OTOH it is helpful to have the full source code at hand for debugging the plugin.

It seems like the linux script is broken - probably because all the developers are using Windows.

Personally, I can't tell what's wrong with the OSGI runtime, never used it myself.

But I can help regarding the POJO runtime.
For the POJO runtime, the idea is to simply add every JAR inside `ReportEngine/lib` to the CLASSPATH (and you have to add your own classes, e.g. for the JDBC driver).
Java offers the not-so-well-known construct `directory_name\*` on Windows resp. `directory_name/*` on Linux to make this easy. 
In this case Java add alls files inside the directory. Note: On Linux, the shell already does this ""globbing"".

I think that the Linux script is missing something analog to this line from the windows script:

    set BIRTCLASSPATH=%THIS_DIR%\lib\*

For POJO, the directory layout is slightly different.

If you just want to generate a report in a separate process, there is no need to mess with the OSGI runtime. It is much more straightforward to use the POJO runtime in that case instead of the OSGI runtime.

The windows script file genReport.bat of the POJO runtime just adds everything in the reportEngine\lib subdirectory to the class path and then calls a java class to generate a single report from the command line.

Please note that the script genReport.bat (or genReport.sh) is not recommended for production for performance reasons.
It is rather a proof of concept demonstrating how to run a single report - not distinguishing between the initialization of the engine (slow, but only needed once) and actually running a report (with RunTask/RenderTask or RunAndRenderTask).

If you want to use BIRT reports in your application, you can either use (and maybe extend) the web viewer using HTTP or you integrate BIRT into your Java program code (I think there is a tutorial for that somewhere).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5C0fO2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Actually, that should have been done much earlier (when the file format actually changed). We now only changed the version number to reflect this change and to allow migration of reports.
I am not using the viewer servlet, only the all-in-one designer and the POJO runtime. Both work like a charm.

@daverch Does this issue (with older reports) occur only in the viewer servlet bot not in the ""run report as ..."" from the all-in-one designer? Can you provide a self-contained example report?

I really like the idea to add more control types for parameters in Birt, the UI control situation in html is far better now, compared to when Birt was first released.
But, I want to do this properly, by first adding support for the new controls in the Birt designer and then create corresponding controls in the web viewer.
Unfortunately, the ""control type handing"" in Birt is in some parts hard-coded, and adding new control types will be a lot of work.
If we do this I guess that it is a good idea to add support for more control types at the same time, since we will need to increase the version number on the design files.

Any suggestions of other new control types, available in html now a days?

One use case which I could imagine could be useful for others is to have a file name as a parameter. But I'm uncertain if supporting a file chooser dialog would be a good idea at all - wouldn't it try to _upload_ the file _content_ somewhere? Does the report need the file location as a string or its content as a blob? Do we have to think about security here? Certainly not something we should introduce thoughtless.

From my point of view, anything else (for example, using a color as a report parameter) is of no practical use..

But I never used the parameter form actually except from the designer to supply one unique ""report job id"", and the application is a database application, so I might be biased.

This error is similar to #935 and #915 and can be related even if those issues are experienced from build versions of Birt.

The problem boils down to that a non-canonical path to the .jsp page is considered an alias by Jetty. The path is then rejected since none of the available org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.AliasCheck.check() calls accepts it.

uk.co.spudsoft.birt.emitters.excel.handlers.StringCellHandler.visit() which was called with an ITableContent .

I have not worked with the Spudsoft emitter at all. We have no reports that uses it.

I do not know when I will have time to take another look at it, it may take another couple of weeks

And I see no way how should it work.

Because the idea of spudsoft is generate the excel sheet on the largest given table (most columns) based on report design file and set all given columns and contents of this excel-layout.
Now the cell content will be created danymicaly which is fine for PDF and HTML but not for excel.
Spudsoft has defined the matrix of the sheet and now it should add new table definitions with partial differet column counts.

The best way woul be if excel is relevant to add the layout of the (cuurently) dynamic tables to the report layout (e.g. 4 single tables). So the full control is given and excel with spudsoft will work. Please be aware you have a special layout which will need time to get a good excel report layout.

I would be desireable to resolve those dependencies transitively via maven, to also be able to check dependencies via maven-enforcer-plugin and in general handle dependencies the maven way.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/951/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yesterday I created a branch [ora_only](https://github.com/triestram-partner/birt/tree/ora_only) where I removed (hopefully) everything related to other databases except Apache Derby and Oracle (because we only need those two).
In particular, I removed Apache Cassandra / Hector.

This branch is based on the tup_main branch, not on the master branch.
But there are only two commits in there, both from 2023-0213.

Thus, by looking at the changes from these commits, it should be possible to see what's necessary to remove Cassandra/Hector.

The main work was to remove lines from various *.xml files (feature.xml, pom.xml and others).
Apart form that, only minor changes to *.java files were necessary.

Note that the two commits cannot be copied as-is to the master branch, because I removed support for more than just Cassandra:
Hive, SQLite (?), PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sybase, Informix, DB2, ...

And I doubt that it would help to use an option:
Security scanners scan the files on disk. They don't know if a vulnerable library is actually used.
So the goal is to avoid delivering these libs at all.
If we managed to use a build option to not include this or that lib, then the number of artifacts to build would increase exponential.

Thus I see only two options for birt/eclipse:

1) The full build as we do now, with built-in support for several different database systems, which seems anachronistic these days from a security point of view.

2) A minimal build (just like mine, but also with Oracle helper libs removed).

For option 2), all those DB support libs should be built as separate artifacts, such that if I want to use BIRT with e.g. Oracle, I need to download a BIRT-Oracle-support.jar artifact which contains those plugins etc. which are needed for Oracle.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5V6G_D/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

***@***.***


However, there is one xml-apis-1.4.01.jar under Weblogic 12  - where everything works fine including the xlsx emitter. The only thing is that our Weblogic 12 environment uses previous version of BIRT (no the latest 4.9 that you just released) and we cannot test latest BIRT 4.9 with Weblogic 12 because latest BIRT 4.9 requires Java11 which is only supported by Weblogic 14+.

It looks like the jars
* javax.xml.stream_1.0.1
* javax.xml_1.3.4
are included. They probably should not be since these interface are part of Java-11, if I recall correctly.

You should try to remove them from the lib folder and see what happens.

I want to inform you that we have had other issues with Birt 4.9.0 that might prevent you from running it in your environment though. Like #941, #865 and #875.

WL 14 and latest BIRT 4.9 both use https://xmlbeans.apache.org/status.html. WL includes version 2.6.0, BIRT uses 3.1.0. There is some method signature mismatch in at least one of the classes, the version of xmlbeans that comes with BIRT 4.9 relies on a new method that does not exist in WL 14 distribution of xmlbeans. I am seeing the error only when downloading a report into xlsx (native excel) format. Everything else seems to be working fine.

WL14 jar - \Oracle\Middleware14.1.1\wlserver\modules\com.bea.core.xml.xmlbeans.jar<file://ashv1294/Oracle/Middleware14.1.1/wlserver/modules/com.bea.core.xml.xmlbeans.jar>
BIRT 4.9 - \lib\org.apache.xmlbeans_3.1.0.v20200922-1359.jar<file://ashv1294/deltek/costpoint/81wls14.1.1/applications/enterprise/APP-INF/lib/org.apache.xmlbeans_3.1.0.v20200922-1359.jar>

Taking BIRT jar, renaming it into WL14’s name (com.bea.core.xml.xmlbeans.jar) and then copy/replace it into \\wlserver\modules\<file://wlserver/modules/> folder fixes xlsx download issue. I don’t see any other outstanding issues as far as BIRT or reports in general. However, whether such jar versions replace may or may not cause any issues for WL itself is unknown. XMLBeans is a “technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types” and it is, probably, used in a lot of places within WL.

it seems there is no possibility to have a two diffrent topMargines in the same report, if i only use one masterpage. I can not use multiple masterpages, since I can not predict how big the elements are and how many will be printed on the first page, before a pageBreak.

Since the topMargine is set in the beforeFactory() I am not able to change it later on during the report.

Is there some workaround for having a diffrent topMargin on the first page?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/957/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You can use e.g. a negative margin for the the very first object on the first page.
This comes handy if you want to have a different header on the first page:
Uncheck ""Show header on first page"" for the master page.
Create a grid to be used as a ""replacement header"" for the first page in the body (not in the master page). Use a negative margin for that grid.
Probably you can use a similar approach.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5CdQgn/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We encounter an exception while testing a report after deploying the BIRT webapp.

## Steps to reproduce
(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)
We first downloading the 'birt-runtime-4.9.0-20220315.zip' file from the 'https://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/drops/R-R1-4.9.0-202203161719/' url we deployed the war in a tomcat 9.0.37 with a Java OpenJDK 15.0.1 environment.
After we test a report and we have this exception:
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/rpc/handler/soap/SOAPMessageContext

## What is the current bug behavior?
In fact there is a problem in 'javax.xml.rpc_1.1.2.v202203150031.jar' libray file from the war file.
This library embed directly the 'javax.xml.rpc-api-1.1.2.jar' libray file.
When we downaloded 'javax.xml.rpc-api-1.1.2.jar' libray file from the 'https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.xml.rpc/javax.xml.rpc-api/1.1.2' url and replace in the WEB-INF/lib directory all is fine.

## What is the expected correct behavior?
It may therefore be necessary to correct the file 'javax.xml.rpc_1.1.2.v202203150031.jar'.

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots
In logs we have this exception:

I have a BIRT report with Mysql 8.018 which worked fine and I am able to see the report. 
After I upgraded Mysql minor version to Mysql 8.021 and any higher version,  The Same BIRT report worked before is not working now and seeing below error. 

Some reports throw: 
org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.EngineException: Column binding ""iStringValue"" has referred to a data set column ""iStringValue"" which does not exist.

Some other reports throw:
org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.EngineException: Not able to evaluate sort, grouping, filter or binding expression. A data field that is used in the expression does not exist in the dataset. Invalid field name: ""iStringValue""

iStringValue is one of the column name in my table. 

I could see no errors when I execute the query directly in Mysql.  So Not sure if this is a problem with BIRT or with Mysql upgrade. Please help.

Currently, we don't have the ressources to keep up with CVEs. Just keep in mind that the team is a small team of volunteers.
If these security issues worry you, you are invited to help with a PR which updates some of the libraries.

OTOH just because a library has vulnerabilities, this doesn't necessarily mean that your product is affected.

For example, take Batik. BIRT uses Batik for SVG rendering.
If your reports don't contain SVGs, or if you can control the SVGs used in your reports (don't allow anyone to upload SVGs from untrusted sources), then you can ignore the Batik vulnerabilities.

And if you integrate BIRT in your application and just don't use the web servlet at all, you can ignore the Jetty vulnerabilities.

But of course: If libraries contain known vulnerabilities, you have to very carefully think about if your program may be affected by one of them.

**In an ideal world, someone would check for vulnerabilities every few days and update the corresponding libraries as soon as a fix is available.** 

Unfortunately, this often means more than just replacing a few JARs and updating version numbers.  In fact this is a very time-consuming, boring and frustrating task. It may well be a full-time job for a single developer.

So nobody wants to do this. 
And it seems nobody wants to pay others for this work.
**So this will probably never happen...**

...with two exceptions:

- If a new library version contains bug fixes which affect the functionality (not the security), chances are that this version will be used in a newer release (of BIRT, or take many other open source projects).
- If a new major release (of BIRT) is prepared, chances are that many of the used libraries are checked for a newer version. But probably not 4 times in a year.

From what it looks like, it also looks for possible errors in the code.

BTW Do we have Dependabot configured for the GH repo?
Personally, I never used any of these tools, but AFAIK Dependabot can even create PRs to bump vulnerable libraries to a newer release (see https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts):

> For repositories where Dependabot security updates are enabled, the alert may also contain a link to a pull request to update the manifest or lock file to the minimum version that resolves the vulnerability

since https://github.com/eclipse/birt/commit/b86b5466030b8e9b684a8fec17081316f19580c0 the query service isn't closed anymore.
If a BIRT report uses many (big) PreparedStatements this leads to massive memory consumption because the JDBC ResultSets are not being closed. 
Because we were experiencing out of memory problems with several big reports in our environment, we've changed QueryResults to close the queryservice and fixed the problem.

I don't know about the ""Get page count failed"" error that should be fixed with the aformentioned commit so I'm not able to test it in our env.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/966/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This manifest is considerably different from the one in the orbit project in that it has far fewer packages exported and has a classpath where the orbit one doesn't.  Just to be sure I also compared orbit 10.11 in maven to the orbit artifact and saw the same differences.  Apparently orbit is applying a special manifest.  I'm going to have to try to replicate that in a project within birt.

I ran a test report with the sampledb and it worked fine, so I don't think this vulnerability is any longer an issue. If the derby OSGI metadata is still a problem, it could be new issue.

Hi @SteveSchafer-Innovent,
In eclipse birt-runtime-4.14 (both OSGI and non-OSGI versions), I can still see derby 10.11.1.1:

You can do this by selecting adjacent in the cells and choose ""merge cells"" from the context menu.
This works in header and footer rows as well.

## However, you can not set the colspan or rowspan attributes *dynamically*.
[This is not quite true, it *is* possible with the DE API (Design Engine API), but only at a very early time in the excecution of the report when you don't have access to the data yet]
The reason is that this would have to change the layout structure.

## Anyway, there is an easy way to achieve the same effect in many cases.

Say, for example, that your table can show textual results and numerical results with a unit, each result in its own row.
So you have (among others) two columns, one for the numerical value and one for the unit.
The textual result can be longer, so you want to merge these two columns to show the textual result for those rows.

The solution here is to create a second detail row.
The first detail row is for a numerical result.
The second detail row is for a textual result.
You can merge the two cells in the second row and show the text result there.
The two cells in the first row show the numerical result and the unit.

Add a visibility expression to the two rows in such a way that the conditions are exactly the opposite.
The first row should be hidden if there is a text result (this might look like `!!row[""TEXT""]`) (the two exclamation marks mean: convert this to a boolean, e.g. true if the text is not empty and false if the text is undefined, null or empty.
For the second row, the visibility expression is `!row[""TEXT""]` with only one explamation mark: hide the row if there is no text.

This one:

ReferenceError: ""MyTestPlugin"" is not defined. (/report/body/label[@id=""6""]/method[@name=""onCreate""]#1)`

I've checked the system configurations, file ownerships and permissions over and over, but did not find the cause for this error.
It seems like the plugin does not get loaded correctly.

I wonder if others had similar problems and were able to fix them.
Maybe there is a dependency of OSGi or BIRT that the operating system has to provide?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/993/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is an option in Excel on border level. It would be a good improvement.
I figured out ""Stack Overflow"" some solutions for HTML (CSS3 and svg) - [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28425574/slanted-diagonal-line-in-html-or-css](url) (the example image is from there).

It is a border property there.

I think there isn't a CSS standard for this. 
The accepted solution in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28425574/slanted-diagonal-line-in-html-or-css with background-image and linear-gradient is working, but I think we cannot use it as-is, at there is a conflict with the existing background-image property.

So I think this cannot be support (reasonably) for the HTML emitter. 

IMHO, for a solution we could add custom CSS border-properties like `border-slash` and `border-backslash` (?) just similar to `border-top`, eg `border-slash-width`etc.
These could fully be supported by PDF, Excel and Word emitters.
For the HTML emitter, there would be some restrictions, the most important being that it doesn't work in conjunction with `background-image`.
Of course, we'd need to add indivual code to the emitters to support this.

So, there'd be three tasks:
1) Add a specification to the ROM model
2) Document the restrictions
3) Add emitter-specific implementations

I think it would be doable for someone with enough time.

When trying to export a report consisting of a text element and a table element using the Spudsoft Excel emitter with `AutoFilter` enabled, we sometimes get the following exception from within Apache POI (CellRangeAddress.java):

`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid cell range, having lastRow < firstRow || lastCol < firstCol`

This always happens when the dataset returns no results, leaving just the header row of the table along with the text field preceeding it. In this case, when trying to apply the auto filter, the starting row equals 1 while the last row equals 0, hence the exception from Apache POI.

Note 1: this ONLY happens when there is at least one text-element or label preceeding the empty table.
Note 2: if the table DOES have values, then the report is generated without errors

I have attached a sample report using the built-in datasource ClassicModel to demonstrate this behaviour.

How to reproduce:

1. Open the attached report in Eclipse BIRT designer 4.9
2. Run ""View Report as XLS_Spudsoft"" or ""XLSX""

How to fix:

In `uk.co.spudsoft.birt.emitters.excel.handlers.TopLevelTableHandler.endTable(..)` (and possibly other locations), the code should check if startrow <= endrow and startCol <= endCol before attempting to call `new CellRangeAddress(..)`

Note: Personally I only ever use the POJO version with ""classic"" class loading and can't tell much about the OSGI runtime or newer class loading mechanisms.  Please take this into account when reading my comments.

I briefly looked at the source code you provided. The code looks more or less ok at first sight.
However, I'm pretty sure that there are at least two mistakes:

First of all, your project is missing a great part of the BIRT runtime libs: The whole ReportEngine/lib is missing.

And inside Print.java, method aBirtEngine, it seems like you try to handle the POJO runtime and the OSGI runtime. AFAIK, BIRT_HOME should only be set for the OSGI version and might cause difficulties for the POJO version.

See the file ReportEngine/genReport.bat for an example how to setup the class path (the same script works for the OSGI and for the POJO runtime).

It seems to me that your issues are somewhat related to the class loading mechanism you are using.

I am using BIRT 4.9 with Java 11 in production code without any problems (with the POJO runtime and classic class loading). So your statement ""BIRT is not integrating to java > 8 in real programs"" is not true.

What might be true (I don't know) is that you are one of the first persons to try to use BIRT with Java 11 modularization.

We can only hope that someone else has already tried that and can help here.

The basic code to generate the report is:

```java
String reportfile = Controller.toPluginFilePath(""reports/perfReport.rpt"");
EngineConfig config = new EngineConfig();
HashMap hm = config.getAppContext();
hm.put(EngineConstants.APPCONTEXT_CLASSLOADER_KEY, getClass().getClassLoader());
config.setAppContext(hm);
ReportEngine engine = new ReportEngine(config);
Platform.startup(config);
IReportRunnable report = engine.openReportDesign(reportfile);
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"");
Date nameDate = new Date();
if (record.getStartDate() != null) {
    nameDate = record.getStartDate();
} else if (record.getEndDate() != null) {
    nameDate = record.getEndDate();
}
String dtstr = sdf.format(nameDate);
File rptdocument = new File(""ptt_report_"" + dtstr + "".rptdocument"");
IRunTask task = engine.createRunTask(report);
task.run(rptdocument.getAbsolutePath());
task.close();
IReportDocument iReportDocument = engine.openReportDocument(rptdocument.getAbsolutePath());
IRenderTask renderTask = engine.createRenderTask(iReportDocument);
File htmlfile = new File(""ptt_report_"" + dtstr + "".html"");
HTMLRenderOption options = new HTMLRenderOption();
options.setOutputFileName(htmlfile.getAbsolutePath());
options.setOutputFormat(""html"");
renderTask.setRenderOption(options);
renderTask.render();
renderTask.close();
```

Any thoughts?

I can't share the whole app for you to reproduce but I can share snippets or try different debug patches.

Attached are the failing and working inputs and outputs in a zip.

```xml
<expression name=""expression"" type=""javascript"">dataSetRow[""Server""]</expression>
```

So given it was having issues resolving data and given the plugin diff showed a version difference in the `org.mozilla.javascript` plugin, I explicitly set the version in my Eclipse `.product` file and re-ran the Maven build and re-tested:

```xml
<plugin id=""org.mozilla.javascript"" version=""1.7.5.v201504281450""/>
```

That fixed it! It seems something between versions `1.7.5.v201504281450` and `1.7.10.v20190430-1943` is causing the `org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.EngineException`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5Fw2zp/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, it implements `org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.script.eventhandler.IScriptedDataSetEventHandler`

I took over this code from someone that left my company, so I'm not very familiar with it. There's nothing complicated or proprietary in `ScriptDataSetHandler.java` so I'm sharing it here in case it gives any hints about the problem:

> Can you reproduce the issue with a JDBC data source and JDBC data sets as well? Maybe the problem is related to the event handler...

That seems like a pretty significant change to test.

Most error situations are ignored silently.
Lines like `System.out.println(...)` and `e.printStackTrace();` won't have any effect unless you setup your system to actually show System.out and System.err somehow.

I recommend to rewrite the error and exception handling from scratch.
A first step to see what's going on might involve removing the exception handling complete or to throw a ScriptException with the current exception as cause.

What I mean is: I think that the terrible exception handling hides the actual error, that's why the stack trace doesn't contain anything useful.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5GCevq/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

One question that you didn't answer yet: Can you reproduce the problem with a JDBC based report (without scripted datasets?).

BTW: Did you already search for known issues in the Rhino project that might be related?

If you are using the BIRT report engine jars, then you can find them generated automatically from Claes' PR.
Open https://github.com/eclipse/birt/actions/runs/2710745400 and look for the birt-runtime artifact. It contains the JARs you are looking for. Be careful: Do not just add them to the existing JARs, because the files contain version numbers. Before copying the JARs, first remove all the old JARs.

You can make it work with a somewhat dirty trick using styles.

Create a predefined style for ""label"" and set e.g. the whitespace property.
Modify  the XML, find the `<styles>` element 

and replace 

    <property name=""whitespace"">nowrap</property>

with

    <property name=""overflow"">visible</property>

inside the element  <style name=""label"" ...>.

Duplicate this style twice and choose ""text-data"" and ""text"" for the other styles.

Finally, it should look like this:

    <styles>
        <style name=""label"" id=""28"">
            <property name=""overflow"">visible</property>
        </style>
        <style name=""text"" id=""29"">
            <property name=""overflow"">visible</property>
        </style>
        <style name=""text-data"" id=""30"">
            <property name=""overflow"">visible</property>
        </style>
    </styles>

Now you do not longer need to manually change the ""Overflow"" property in the ""advanced"" tab for every label or text.

You could probably also use a theme in a library and use that theme in the report, instead of adding the 3 styles directly to every report.

The ""dirty"" thing here is that ""overflow"" cannot be set in the style editor dialog.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5GwGAC/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You probably want to write:

```
function replaceSubScript(str) {
	if (!str) {
		return """";
	}
	return str.replace(""₂"", ""<SUB>2</SUB>"");
}
```

The `!` operator will return true for an empty string, `undefined` and `null`.

Or dou you really want to compare a string to the number zero?

Besides, always be very careful when using string methods, in particular `replace`.

This is probably one of the cases where Rhino causes difficulties.

To recap: 
BIRT uses Javascript for logic inside the reports.
BIRT uses Java internally.
The Javascript engine is Rhino - a Javascript implementation written in Java.
Rhino allows to acces Java objects from Javascript more or less seamlessly.

Not sure, but I think that the *column bindings* are actually Java objects, not Javascript objects.

_This is a typical example of the ""less"" case._

Let us assume that the if condition is false and the expression `str.replace(..., ...)` is actually evaluated.

The `replace` methods of a Java string and a Javascript string differ significantly: 
The Javascript method expects a regular expression as the first argument (or a string).
The Java method expects either a Java String or a Java CharSequence object as the first argument.

If `str` is `null` or a Javascript `number` object, e.g. 3.14 or whatever: 
Original code: Its `replace` method cannot be called.
With `String(str)`: The  `String` constructor will always return a Javascript string ""null"" or ""3.14"", and then its (Javascript) `replace` method is called.

If `str` is a Javascript string, then `String(str)` is basically a no-op:
Original code: The Javascript `replace` method is called.
With `String(str)`: ditto.

If `str` is a Java string:
Original code:  *Rhino has to guess what you mean*, because the Java String class has different `replace` methods. This probably results in an error message or an exception (I stumbled across this several times myself).
With `String(str)`: The `String` constructor returns an equivalent Javascript string, then its (Javascript) `replace` method is called.

If `str` is any other Java object:
Original code: Will fail (if we assume that the Java class has no `replace` method)
With `String(str)`: I don't know what happens.

Note: I'm not absolutely sure here. Javascript as a programming language is still a kind of mystery to me.

I am using the following functions in our reports (comments are in german).
They'll allow you to write ""The chemical formula for water is H_2O. 3 <= Pi <= 4. A well-known constant is: 6.023 * 10^{23}'.
This is a tiny subset of LaTeX syntax.

I am using `("""" + text"")` therein which has more or less the same effect as `String(text)`.

```
function escapeHtml(plaintext) {
    if (plaintext == null) {
    	return """";
    }
    return (""""+plaintext).replace(/[&amp;<>""']/g, function (s) {
      var entityMap = {
          ""&"": ""&amp;"",
          ""<"": ""&lt;"",
          "">"": ""&gt;"",
          '""': '&quot;',
          ""'"": '&#39;'
        };
      return entityMap[s];
    });

Probably the image is a photo?
Can you share an example image here?

We could then test if the issue still persists with the current BIRT release 4.9.

Some cameras or smartphones are ""clever"": If you tilt the device by 90° to the left or to the right°, they notice this fact.
The hardware/software which is creating a JPEG from the raw camera sensor data always works in the same way regardless of whether you are creating a portrait or landscape photo.
When saving the JPEG, information about what is actually ""up"" is written to the EXIF metadata (or other metadata).

New image processing software usually knows about this metadata and uses it to rotate the decompressed image before presenting it to the user.

Older image processing software - as is used in BIRT 4.3.2 - does not know about this metadata and thus shows a rotated image if the device was tilted by +/-90°.

This is explained in more detail eg. here: https://jdhao.github.io/2019/07/31/image_rotation_exif_info/

You will need to pre-process such images before showing them in BIRT.

We would like to use jndi to supply the connection. We used JndiKit to serve this. However, we were unable to convince birt to consume our properties file to reach the datasource, because it does not look in an amenable place for it.

Specifically, `JndiDataSource.getDriverJndiPropertyFile()` uses `OdaJdbcDriver.getDriverDirectory()` which uses `ManifestExplorer.getInstance().getDriverLocation()` . Because we use gradle to depend on the birt runtime and the mysql jdbc driver, this points to the jar in my gradle cache. : `file:/opt/workspace/gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.innoventsolutions.birt.runtime/org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.8.0-20180626/4.8.0/5fbd2fa6b165bb5b5493b2acdd6832257b97f5de/org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.8.0-20180626-4.8.0.jar!/drivers` . Changing the birt home of the engine config to the working directory prefixes that directory to the previous filepath. I wasn't able to work around this issue by creating a folder of the same name as the jar, as I can not have a file and folder of the same name in a folder. Hence, I can't copy my jndi properties file without zipping it into the birt runtime jar itself until #625 works.

It would help for my use case - which I recognize is the minority - to allow programmatic configuration of some aspect of the birt engine, such that JndiDataSource can look for a jndi.properties file in an arbitrary location of the same filesystem.

It would also be nice if the complaint about jndi explained where it failed to find the properties file (with FINEST logging), given that it does check and lets InitialContext mistakenly suggest an environment variable.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1034/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I acknowledge that I am not familiar with Eclipse / Birt conventions. It looks like the closest they approach is `AbstractDataEngine.prepare()` receives appContext which contains ""EngineTask"" which contains `engine` which contains `config`. Prepare defines a dataset which gets a data set and then defines it. Defining a data set in `ModelDteApiAdapter` gets a data source and then defines it.

Using the BIRT viewer I am able to generate a report using the XLSX emitter. However, when I open it Excel (2016) indicates there is a problem opening the file and it gives me a recovery option. When I select the recovery option it then gives me the following message:

```
Excel completed file level validation and repair. Some part of the workbook may have been repaired or discarded. 
Removed records: Named range from /xl/workbook.xml part (Workbook)
```

If I look inside the `/xl/workbook.xml` file I can see that it has a very long named expression. Please see [here](https://github.com/eclipse/birt/files/9430511/workbook.xml.txt).

When generating smaller reports, with fewer rows/groups I do not see this error, so I suspect the issue is to do with the the large number of rows/groups, and building the named expression for the grouping.

As a temporary workaround for the issue I removed the code inside the `uk.co.spudsoft.birt.emitters.excel.handlers.AbstractHandler.createName` method. This enabled me to run my large report without any errors from Excel.

    xx
    xx
       xx
       xx
          xx
          xx

... and so on

It's not the *name* which is long, it's the cell range defined by the name.
A structure like this cannot be simplified (which was my first thought).

Next thought: Instead of just removing all the code inside the `createName` method, maybe you can use a UserProperty to decide wether to call skip the code or not.

By looking at the places from where `createName` is called, it seems like it is only called if a cell (or row, group, whatever) has a bookmark.

So it should be possible to easily avoid calls to `createName` if you just don't use bookmarks in your report.

Note that the bookmarks are Javascript expressions.
I don't know for sure if a `null` or `undefined` bookmark is treated like no bookmark at all, but you can test that of course. Given that's the case, you could use any condition you like in your report to avoid bookmarks for the huge reports.

I also experimented by setting the bookmark on the group to `null` or `undefined` (instead of no value) and that didn't seem to help.

It seems to me that when I added the grouping to the report it implicitly added a bookmark into the report. I'm guessing a little bit here.

I just found that If I modify this report to use an Auto Layout and disable page breaks then the error goes away.

Also, with my original report (which uses grouping), if I disable page breaks on the group, then the Excel error also goes away too.

What I'm trying to achieve is have a report which uses groups, where each new group will be displayed on a separate page. It seems that when I'm using page breaks, this causes Birt to automatically add each page into the named range which causes issues when there are large number of groups/page breaks.

This report uses grouping and Page Break After is set to 'Always Excluding Last'. There is no (explicit) usage of bookmarks or TOC in the report.

When this report is exported to Excel you should be able to see the error in my first comment.

Some observations:
 * Error case - If I have the page break enabled on each group, then it seems like `AbstractRealTableHandler.endTable` gets called once per group (611 times) and this is creating/updating a bookmark each time it is called.
 * Working case - If the page break on the group is set to 'Auto', then `AbstractRealTableHandler.endTable` is called 2 times - I think this is because 2 page breaks get automatically created for the report.

Yeah, my original approach was a dirty hack to troubleshoot the issue. Would it best to have a UserProperty or should it be a property which is passed into the emitter?

I confirm there is an issue with the rcp-designer. I started some retests with the same configuration like above with JVM11.
The issue is located at the services of POSTSCRIPT and PDF. Both output formats cann't be processed.

**Processing of PS error message:**

![BIRT-PS-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41593722/189985555-097df51a-14d7-4575-a139-be65756dd96d.png)

**Processing PDF - result is an empty PDF:**

![BIRT-PDF-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41593722/189985708-f13e5605-098b-4755-a46b-d06a984b5cbe.png)

Both errors are reproducable with the BIRT-viewer and with the direct processing call from the designer (without designer).
The other output formats can be produced correctly.


**Regression test (manual) BIRT 4.9 with the ""all-in-one""-designer (JVM11):**
- PDF-document created correctly
- PS-document ended in error above

**Regression test (manual) BIRT 4.8 with the ""all-in-one""-designer (JVM8):**
- PDF-document created correctly
- PS-document created correctly

Can somebody assists with it. It seams to be an issue with the SOAP-service requests or the emitter service registration.

Best regards

Is there a specific reason why you use the RCP Report Designer? It lacks a large number of features, one of which is proper logging.

Which sounds logical.
I think that Java generics and Rhino cannot work together well.

In Javascript, null ist just null.
It's not a null String, a null Integer, a null (you name it).

I wonder how this could even work with BIRT 4.3.

I am not at all familiar with ICU, but to my understanding com.ibm.icu.util.ULocale is the ""enhanced version"" of java.util.Locale . The error message ""Access restriction: The type 'ULocale' is not API"" seems strange since ULocale probably is API, from ICU's perspective. The visibility of the packages must have been altered with the latest version of the platform.

A search for ""import com.ibm.icu"" in the Birt workspace produces 985 matches.  Some migration to core java can probably be automated, but it is still a big job.

A possible way to handle this could be:

As a first step, remove all import `com.ibm.icu...` statements from the source code and remove the ICU library.

Then work like this: search for ULocale, add an import java.util.Locale to these files and replace ULocale with Locale.

And so on for other classes - for most if not all of them there should be a corresponding class in Java's builtin libraries.

Hopefully there will be only few cases where such an exact replacement is not possible, or none at all.

That should make the build process work with some effort.

If every edge case actually works like before, that's a different question, see for example the comment in the bug Claes mentioned.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5KobA6/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I also see that the format for maven dependencies in target platform files has changed some. Do we need to update Tycho as well? 

Looking in the PDE, the ""org.eclipse.birt.core.ui"" actually doesn´t have access to com.ibm.icu.util seems strange that this has worked earlier.

In fact, the ojdbc driver version you should use is depending on the JDK version and the RDBMS version.

Oracle JDBC can use the thin driver (pure Java) or a C-based driver (based on ODPI or classic OCI). The latter also needs DLLs.

We are facing various assert errors when we tests our reports with assertions enabled (ie -ea JVM flag)
This is happening when we create a render task and the Birt Engine tries to open and parse the report design. The simplest way to reproduce the issue is to define a themes.rptlibrary with a custom theme defined (linked to a css file) and apply the theme to the report design.
When testing the report with -ea flag set we get the following stack trace:

```
We noticed that the error doesn't happen if we pass the IReportRunnable of the report design to the IRenderTask.createRenderTask method. It seems that in this case the parsing is bypassed, but then the generated pdf contains many unexpected layout issues that may be caused by the fact that some dynamic design changes via the API are not applied.

When running the report without the IReportRunnable argument in the createRenderTask method, and without the -ea flag the report is generated correctly. However the fact that there are AssertionError thrown when runing with -ea flag indicates either a misuse/misconfiguration of the engine or a bug in the engine.

long story:

I have been a long term user of BIRT (from 2002 to 2010), and was forced to move to other solution, as the product went side way under actuate/opentext. Happy to see it coming back, as it was one of my favorite.

One of the major limitation was JSON support.

During Opentext days as BIRT main contributor, a very buggy data source for JSON was introduced. I  I did not look at the current 4.10 version (will do in coming weeks). Does anyone know what is the state of the JSON dara source ? The XML data source was much more powerful (and reliable), and we used to convert json to xml, and generate report. 

If the json data source is not usable/abandoned - possible to fix it ? If not, I wonder if possible to clone the XML data source, replace the XML parser with JSON parser. XPATH path with jsonpath, and have a reporting tool capable of connecting with modern rest services. Even if the temporary solution will be to internally convert json to xml it will be a big win. 

considering built in JavaScript with RHINO, will be a big upside.

Instead, all calculations should be done with 10-based numbers in this case.

That's the reason why most programming languages (including ancient Cobol) also support data types like `java.lang.BigDecimal` which are able to store decimal values as such and to perform calculation. A conversion from a binary floating point number to a 10-based number and vice versa incurs a conversion error in many cases.

For example, take 31/10 = 3.1 (exactly).
According to https://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/ieee-754.old/decimal.html, when converting this to an IEEE 754 32bit `float`,
this is 0x40466666, and converting back to a decimal representation with 8 significant digits, is is approx. 3.0999999.

BTW: 
We have a VAT of 19% in Germany, and I have to create invoices with BIRT - so I know how tricky it is.
Actually, I try to avoid BIRT's aggregations then and instead I perform all the calculations witihn SQL with group functions or analytic functions.
Also note that e.g. Oracle's 10-based NUMBER data type uses a different rounding mode in comparsion to Oracle's BINARY_FLOAT / BINARY_DOUBLE, IIRC.

**I debugged a simple report and can see that - unfortunately - BIRT converts `BigDecimal` to `double`:**

excerpt from TotalSum.java:

		@Override
		public void onRow(Object[] args) throws DataException {
			assert (args.length > 0);
			if (args[0] != null) // ignore nulls in calculations
			{
				sum = calculator.add(sum, calculator.getTypedObject(args[0]));
			}
		}

excerpt from NumberCalculator.java:

	@Override
	public Object getTypedObject(Object obj) throws DataException {
		try {
			return DataTypeUtil.toDouble(obj);
		} catch (BirtException e) {
			throw DataException.wrap(e);
		}
	}

In DataTypeUtil.java, the toDouble method calls an overloaded method of the same name.

	public static Double toDouble(Object source, ULocale locale) throws CoreException {
        ...
		if (source instanceof Double) {
			return (Double) source;
		} else if (source instanceof Number) {
			if (!isConvertableToDouble((Number) source)) {
				throw new CoreException(ResourceConstants.CONVERT_FAILS, new Object[] { source.toString(), ""Double"" });
			}
			double doubleValue = ((Number) source).doubleValue();
			return new Double(doubleValue);
		} else if (source instanceof Boolean) {

which calls

	private static boolean isConvertableToDouble(Number n) {
		assert n != null;

		double doubleValue = n.doubleValue();
		return !Double.isInfinite(doubleValue);

	}

To summarize (pun intended :-), BIRT will convert a `BigDecimal` resp. BIRT `decimal` value to `double` before summing it up.

Probably later this `double` value will be converted to `BigDecimal` again. I'm not sure about this: I tried to debug this but failed - even for a very simple report it is hard to debug this if you don't know where to look.

Thus in some cases you will face a small difference if you compare BIRT's output to what you get out if you very carefully compute everything manually in the decimal system.
This difference may look like a rounding error, but it can also be a conversion error.

I suggest - if your data is from an SQL database - that you  perform the calculations on the SQL side.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5MmImU/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Well, I understand the floating math and get it that in a lot of cases it is no good for financial calculations. But that is why you have Decimal (BigDecimal) data type.  My understanding was that if you use Decimal control in BIRT it should display the number as it is w/o any internal conversion to double and then back to BigDecimal. That seems to be not the case and as the result you end with the wrong number. Each time decimal values are converted to double before any calculation and formatting the number may lose the precision aspect of the Decimal data type (which is really what Decimal type is designed for).

We occasionally run across such issues in BIRT reports though we are using only Decimal data type for DataSource/DataSet columns, aggregates/totals and report controls.
The suggestion to calculate totals/aggregates in SQL instead of doing the same via report engine seems to be quite an overreach...What for would need a report engine then???
Finally, found this discussion from old days about BIRT fully supporting BigDecimal calculations - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=155138.

I wish the final conclusion of that discussion would be true...

I agree this is a bug which is still not fixed.

> Probably, the internal scripting is also doing double conversion in between and then BIRT classes convert the end result into BigDecimal.

To be precise: AFAIK it is not scripting done in Rhino which is causing this error. It's caused by the Java implementation in the source files I mentioned (and other source files for other aggregate functions).

> Is there any way to fix that or is that part of rhino scripting which is beyond the scope?

As this is caused on the Java side, it should be possible to fix it (in the abovementioned source files).

But I doubt that anyone will fix it (unless you fix it yourself by providing a PR), because it would be quite an effort:

I think it would be necessary to support all the calculations in two different ways:
a) for number objects with a binary based representation (using Java's `double` or `Double` internally).
b) for number objects with a decimal based representation (using Java's `BigDecimal` internally).
... and to take care of the possible case that these types of numbers are mixed in the calculations (e.g. by coercing to `BigDecimal`).

Furthermore, if you actually do any financial computations in Javascript (not BIRT aggregates), you're probably doomed:
As Claes said and according to https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp, numbers in Javascript are always IEEE 754 `double`.

A workaround which avoids most of these problems is to use CT (instead of EUR or USD) as your basis (see http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/avoiding-problems-with-decimal-math-in-javascript.html).
For division (e.g. German VAT computation `x * 19 / 100`), there is still a possible error, because AFAIK Javascript uses round-half-even mode for numbers, which is absolutely OK for scientific computations to avoid a statistical bias, but for rounding in invoices, the norm EN 16931 for example prescribes mercantile rounding (round up 0.5 to 1 for positive numbers, round down -0.5 to -1 for negative numbers).

If the one would need an exact value the script needs to create a BigDecimal instead. Javascript does not have a corresponding type so the way to do that is:
`new java.math.BigDecimal(""1111111111111112.12"");` instead of the `1111111111111112.12` literal. Just setting the Birt datatype to ""Decimal"" is not enough since it will be instantiated with the floating point value from the javascript expression.

With that said: There are bugs or at least lack of function in BIRTs calculations. These are highlighted by @hvbtup in one of the comments. The aggregator functions of BIRT does not use BigDecimal where appropriate. The aggregator functions (AggrFunction) that use decimals all has ""DataType.DOUBLE_TYPE"" set as datatype. This will select a the ""NumberCalculator"" and that calculator always converts numbers to doubles in calculations.

There are currently no way for the report designer to define what precision that should be used. It is possible to define the datatype for a ""computed column"" in a dataset, but that information is not taken into account (nor available) when the ICalculator, that will perform the calculations, is selected. The datatype only affects the resulting datatype. This means that all calculations will be done with doubles and then converted to the selected datatype.

I see three different ways forward:

a) Change the aggregator functions that needs higher then double precision to ""Decimal"", so a BigDecimalCalculator is selected for calculations during aggregation. 
b) Take the result datatype (selected be the report designer) into account when selecting calculator. Basically, if the return type is Decimal and the AggrFunction is ""DataType.DOUBLE_TYPE"", select BigDecimalCalculator, otherwise do as before.
c) For the aggregator functions that may need higher then double precision, take the result datatype (selected be the report designer) into account when selecting calculator. Basically, if the return type is Decimal and the AggrFunction is ""DataType.DOUBLE_TYPE"", select BigDecimalCalculator, otherwise do as before.

To solve the `x * 19 / 100` problem, if done in Javascript one would need to write an expression like this:
`(new java.math.BigDecimal(""101010"")).multiply(new java.math.BigDecimal(""0.19""), java.math.MathContext.DECIMAL128)`

@hvbtup if I were to try to ""close"" https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=155138 again could you provide me with a test report that reproduces all the known BigDecimal problems? I am aware of the aggregation functions and the Javascript literals, but are there others?

The topic of proper calculation is actually quite complex.

I'll try to collect some brief notes here about what can go wrong:

* First of all, implicit conversion is the cause of so many errors in all kinds of software. I really wish all programming languages would forbid them.
* A conversion from a 10-based number representation to or from a 2- (or 16-) based number representation will almost always result in precision loss due to conversion errors. E.g. you cannot a value like 0.1 (1/10) exactly as a float or double.
* For most computations, there are several different ways to correctly calculate them if we assume we can store all numbers exactly. But in reality, we cannot store numbers exactly, and thus in reality the resulting errors depend *very much* on the way we perform the calculation due to rounding errors. That's what the mathematical discipline ""numerics"" is all about - to perform calculations that the unvoidable rounding errors have minimal impact on the end result.
* It makes a difference *when* we round. As a simple example, say we have to exact input values 1/2 and 1/2. Our end result should be an integer. If we can compute with the exact values and round afterwards, we get 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.0 = 1. But if we round the individual values, then 0.5 will be rounded up to 1, so the result is 1+1 = 2.

As a result of what I said above, your wording ""higher precision than double"" is not correct. 
Usually nobody needs higher double precision in a calculation. 

One would use float (or double) variables if the values are usually not exact anyway, e.g. they are measures (in the sense that someone has actually measured something, e.g. the alcohol contrentration of a liquor).
In such a case, one usually should store all measured values as doubles (unless they describe *counting* something) and perform all calculations with the double datatype and round-half-even rounding mode, and store the result as double. Only in the last step, when presenting the result to a user, the result has to be converted from double (2-based) into a decimal representation. In this last step, conversion error is inevitable. But all the calculations are then good from a numerical point of view, if we take as given that we can store numbers only with limited memory size (in bytes).

But when the calculations are about offers/invoices/taxes/money, then we must use decimal datatypes and (usually) round-half-up from the start to the end. That means all intermediate results must be stored in decimal form, too.

*This ""commercial"" kind of calculation avoids all conversion errors, but it still incurs rounding errors.*

So it's not ""higher precision than double"", but instead a slightliy different way of performing the calculation to avoid conversion errors.

Shouldn't it be possible to let the internal calculations use something like `T <extends Number>` for the calculations?

The idea of the BIRT runtime distribution is to have every dependency included, in a combination that actually works.

You can consider using the OSGI runtime. OSGI promises to solve such compatibility issues (just like modularization in never Java versions), allowing you to use different releases of the same library in different parts of your program.

You can also consider running BIRT in a separate process (e.g. use Tomcat with the BIRT viewer and use BIRT's HTTP API to run reports).

**But currently I cannot say why this effect happens.**

I have the same issue with BIRT_4.8 an plugin-files which are built only with JDK8 without compatibility mode of other JDKs or of >= JDK11.
I see in your MANIFEST.MF that you have the same environment issue:

![plugin-MANIFEST-JDK1 8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41593722/204366859-eafad939-2c25-412b-82a6-842f7b4f86a9.png)

The issue happens because due to the JSE1.8 the ""org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator"" doesn't create the bundle.info correctly.

So you have to add 2 lines manuelly with the according path (changed to your path):

01) path: C:\BIRT_4.11\eclipse\configuration\org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator

02) add the 2 plugin lines
com.deltek.enterprise.system.reporting.client.birt.oda.designer,1.0.0,plugins/com.deltek.enterprise.system.reporting.client.birt.oda.designer_1.0.0.jar,4,false
com.deltek.enterprise.system.reporting.client.birt.oda.runtime,1.0.0,plugins/com.deltek.enterprise.system.reporting.client.birt.oda.runtime_1.0.0.jar,4,false


Result - your data source without ""red"" cross:

I have noticed that resizing a window which has a BIRT drawn pie chart goes wrong on high resolution displays on Windows.

The code constructs a pie chart using a PieSeries.

It is then drawn using Generator.build() and then using a new GC and a new SWT Image, Generator.render() into the Image before a gc.drawImage to draw the chart into a SWT graphics context.

If the window is resized then the build/render/drawImage steps are repeated as the build bounds will have changed. Each time the steps are repeated the pie chart leader lines get thicker until they obscure the chart. Then after 20+ redraws the leader lines disappear. 

See [Bug 581154](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=581154) for images [Thick leader lines](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=288866)

I think what is happening is the build step the [render code at Generator.java](https://github.com/eclipse/birt/blob/62d2ab909d7809c1a2942fb3d471f9427c38bd4d/chart/org.eclipse.birt.chart.engine/src/org/eclipse/birt/chart/factory/Generator.java#L1018) does an `updateDeviceScale` which each time multiplies the leader line thickness in the chart. As the chart is not rebuilt each time the leader lines double in thickness until they eventually overflow to 0.

I fixed the ChartExamples view so that they can run without Eclipse running,  but I do not see any resize artifacts. Please see attached. 

How do you trigger the renderer? Are you rebuilding the chart every time?

The line `final int scale = idr.getDisplayServer().getDpiResolution() / 72;` must return at least 2 for the problem to occur, so getDpiResolution() >= 144.

The problem is that if scale >= 2 then the scale code in BIRT is executed every time gr.build() is done and it modifies the chart each time, doubling the line thickness.

I can fix the problem by instead of doing in my code:
`       state = gr.build(renderer.getDisplayServer(), chart, bo, null, rtc, null);`
doing:
`       state = gr.build(renderer.getDisplayServer(), chart.copyInstance(), bo, null, rtc, null);`

Is this the right way to solve the problem?

The chart is the model of the renderer. The renderer updates the model, so passing a copy will not reflect these changes in the original model. I'm not sure if this will have side effects.

The issue we've faced is that generated PDFs doesn't respect the CSS property `line-height` in cases when this property is < 100%.

Debugging shows that the reason is logic in `LineArea` and `InlineStackingArea` classes. I will provide a PR which fixes this.

We created a separate report for PDF with Orientation as RTL and were able to achieve what was desired.

However, we are facing below issues when the report is extracted in PDF -
1. The same HTML content are not uniform in the DOCX as well as in PDF. Please see below -

For every single query a new connection is created. We are using a Wildfly 26.1.2 instance where birt.war is running to service different RPTDESIGN files. We have configured a connection pool to the database which is used in the design files using odaJndiName property. This way we can manage the connections that are made on the server. After we migrated to the new app server, new drivers, etc. we found that the connection pool kept clogging up. This only happened when running BIRT reports.

After investigating the problem it seems that in  org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.Connection in the method getMaxQueries() there is a conditional structure figuring out the max number of statements. In the instance of our SQL server the max statements is 0 (unlimited) and the max connections is 32767 (SQL Server max setting). The conditional then will return a max number of queries of 1 !!!! This makes every single query trigger a new connection. Instead I would expect that this method always returns 0 in case maxstatements =0., regardless of the number of maximum connections.

I have fixed the issue in  a fork here:

I've seen that [iText has been replaced with OpenPDF](https://github.com/eclipse/birt/issues/767). Maybe this change is related to my problem.

Do you have an idea what may cause my problem or what I can do to investigate further?

It seems that this error happens, because the library jar file _ReportEngine/lib/chartitemapi.jar_ of BIRT 4.10 OSGi does not contain the file _/org/eclipse/birt/chart/engine/i18n/nls.properties_.

With BIRT 4.8 everything is fine. Probably because the file is present in its _ReportEngine/lib/chartitemapi.jar_.

To add some additional informations, what I saw not working on Jakarta EE 10 at this moment is the **Viewer Tag Library**.

When trying to deploy a project including the ""viewerservlets.jar"" with tag library enabled, it runs into lots of ""java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError"" exceptions.
By example the first one looks like :

> WARN  [org.jboss.modules.define] (MSC service thread 1-1) Failed to define class org.eclipse.birt.report.taglib.AbstractBaseTag in Module ""xxx.war"" from Service Module Loader: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed to link org/eclipse/birt/report/taglib/AbstractBaseTag (Module ""xxx.war"" from Service Module Loader): javax/servlet/jsp/tagext/TagSupport

And finally, the deployment ends with : 

> WARN  [org.jboss.as.ee] (MSC service thread 1-1) WFLYEE0007: Not installing optional component org.eclipse.birt.report.taglib.ParamDefTag due to an exception

A move to the jakarta namespace would require us to use Jetty11 instead.

I have, in principle, nothing against this, but it would probably require us to maintain two separate branches of BIRT since the javax namespace is far from dead.

The current build re-mastering will be done with JDK17.

Unicode Symbol 173 is the soft-hyphen symbol known as `SHY`.
The abbreviation SHY is fitting perfectly, because this symbol usually hides itself and only should be visible at the end of a line.

Some languages, German in particular, tend to use very long words, for example in chemistry.
In some cases, the text containing these words is predefined somewhere, e.g. in a database.
So it makes sense to store good possible hyhenation points by placing the SHY symbol at these places inside the word,
e.g. for a word like ""kapillar­gaschromato­graphisch"" this could be stored as ""kapillar-gas-chromato-graphisch"".
Notes:
1) There are more possible hyphenation points inside this word, e.g. ""ka-pil-lar-gas-chro-ma-to-graph-isch"", but not all of them good for readability.
2) I used the minus sign instead of the SHY symbol, because you wouldn't see it: The browser understands it and would hide it.
3) This does not mean we need *automatic* hyphenation. But if the text is already prepared for hyphenation, let's just use that info.

As far as I can tell, the PDF emitter does all the line-breaking logic inside BIRT.
So it should be possible to specifically handle the SHY symbol inside pre-hyphenated word and to consider it in the simple word-breaking algorithm.
It should also be possible to make this work in some way for the Word emitter. At least it seems necessary to replace a SHY character with `<w:softHyphen/>` in the XML output.

I'll ask my boss if and when I can get the time to tackle this.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1179/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

 - The bottom border line of the cells in the last row of page 1 is not rendered.
 - The table header row is missing on page 2.

See the following picture:

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644776/214247686-a99b0a4c-4c6f-4823-b05a-13fd0a791bb0.png)

Expected output:
- A line below the last row on page 1.
- The table header on page 2.

As in this picture created from slightly different data:

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644776/214248709-c4f8edcd-1cd8-42df-aedd-d2031985d81b.png)

It is just a header row and a detail row.
The first cell of the detail row contains a dynamic text item and a list item containing another dynamic text item.
Both dynamic text items contain HTML.
So nothing special here, from a layout point of view.
The cells all have a border:

We are using Eclipse BIRT Designer Version 4.7.0.v201706222054.
We have generated a report with a TrueType font Poppins.

In the report designer the font is shown correctly. When the report is generated the font is Times.

Are you absolutely sure about that?

Windows has become more and more strange regarding the storing of TTF files.

You can also try to copy the font to a different folder under your control.
You can than edit a file `fontsConfig.xml` and add your folder (or even your specific file) there.
AFAIK, this file is somewhere inside `birt.war`.

I did this a few times.

Here I assume that the data source is an SQL database.

The idea is that you let the DB do the heavy lifting and select the data already sorted. Then you don't need to keep the rows in memory, the program can ""forget"" a row just after it was written to the CSV file.

Such a streaming process is much more difficult when you create XLSX.
I know that the SpudSoft Excel emitter supports special options for this kind of processing (I can't name them, you'd have to look at the source code), but I doubt that this works with grouping.

And reading/processing such a huge XLSX file will also need much more processing power and memory in comparison to reading/processing a CSV file.

Using the XLSX file format for this is just a waste of resources.

No offence meant. I know how clients are...
Maybe hearing that XLSX is not the best interchange format for mass data from a third party can help you convincing them to use a different format.

The core is based on the apache POI library.

But the common reason of the long runtime is the internal characteristic of XLSX.
Because the file format is an zip-file which includes different XML-files splitted into different context.
If you use such huge data and groups all data must be handled in memory and the topic is that the XML-document tree must be handled at all.

You can compare it with an large HTML-file which you try to run on your LINUX-128GB-machine with an browser.
The limitation isn't only the physical size. At the end each is fact that operations like search or adding of such structure needs more time direct depending on structure growing.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5VxQpD/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For me, the restrictions seem to conflict.

The original issue (slow performance) was solved by setting the render option DisableGrouping.
Then you hit the technical limit of Excel with too many rows in a single sheet, which cannot be solved by BIRT.

Thus limiting the rows on a single sheet is necessary.

The issue you described last is that the ""sheet-breaking"" does not work like you want it to be.
This is very different from the original issue.

I'll close this issue now to keep it focused on the original problem.

For the ""sheet-breaking"" issue, I propose that you create a stand-alone report which demonstrates the problem with a much smaller number of rows, a clear description of what the restrictions are and what you want to achieve, and create a separate issue with this information.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5WoIrQ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

**Fix recommendation**
The preferred algorithms for symmetric key cryptography are AES and Twofish. For asymmetric key encryption, RSA is the standard
algorithm; for new development, use a minimum key length of 2048 bits. For hash algorithms, SHA-1 was the standard until recently.
However, SHA-1 now has some known theoretical weaknesses and is considered suspect.
Meanwhile, SHA-256 becomes the generally recommended hash function. NIST has mandated that as soon as practical, federal
agencies stop using SHA-1 and switch to the SHA-2 family of hash algorithms (such as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512) for
all but a few types of uses.
NIST encourages the use of SHA-2 algorithms for all new development.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1219/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

However,
the code which uses the ""InsecureAlgorithm"" (md5) is used for the calculation of hashes returned by Object.hashCode(). These hashes are always 32 bits (an int) and are mainly used by hashmaps in Java. Hash collisions by Object.hashCode() are totally ok.  If you want to know more about the hashCode() contract you can do so by reading the javadoc here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()

But perhaps another solution would be do handle the information of the totals in an additional row
and the count of current used rows. In the extrem case that XLSX-with maximum 1,048,576 will be used
then exactly this line would be the total line.

I used the base report page_break.zip and added an additional total line.
The line number and total calculation will be done in very small scripts and the ""pink"" row includes an according visibility condition for display an reset of line numbers.

Based on the example each data-row 100 get an additional detail row withthere total.
Perhaps it can help you in one of your next topics.

To date, we integrate the BIRT runtime into our application by using the BIRT Runtime zip artifact.
This zip contains several jars as regular dependencies, however interestingly, also a jar named `org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.x.jar`.

This jar contains many further dependencies in the good old ""fat jar"" manner, like guava, slf4j, cassandra and many more.
And because of the hidden nature of fat-jars, it is cumbersome to resolve conflicts with other dependencies of our software.
Currently, we do this by deleting stuff in the jar which we assume are not required but of course, this introduces some risks.

**Is there an alternative for this approach? And if not, can we do better than that?**

Ideally, BIRT would provide runtime artifacts which do not contain any fat jars.
And even better, the build artifact or its documentation would express which dependencies are optional
and safe to exclude (e.g. you only need the POI jars when you want to use the office emitters) or if required, which version ranges are acceptable in order to provide maximum compatibility and to enable the safe usage of jar-dependencies we provide (which has additional benefits like security aspects).

 1) Today, any library which is not needed is also not wanted, for security reasons.
 2) You want to ged rid of the fat jars.
  
The first component is related to #1217, #1037, #1033 and #951.

In my comments to #951, I showed how I got rid of all other DB libraries except Oracle (which we need in our use-case) by modifying the source projects.

And @wimjongman said that it would be nice if we could get drivers dynamically.

If we transmit Wim's idea also to the emitters, we would have a relatively small BIRT core, and a bunch of input drivers (read: DB drivers / support libraries) and emitters (read: supported output formats).
BIRT users would then be able to create a customized BIRT by downloading the BIRT core and only those DB drivers and emitters they need.

This would solve point 1). However, I have no clue how to achieve this technically. Still being an OSGI noob, my gut feeling that it should be possible with the feature/bundle/plugin techniques.

I can't say anything about point 2) and I don't know if 1) and 2) can be handled independently.

Your comments in issue #951 matches more or less our expectations (beside the fat jar aspect).
Sorry that I've missed this issue.

The ""minimalistic core"" with optional ""plugins"" is exactly what we need and probably others would need as well.

When it comes to JDBC - are there any hard-wired references to driver specifics (e.g. classes)?
If yes, can't we refactor those to use pure JDBC instead (e.g. by using the DriverManager for obtaining a connection)?
If not, why are those packaged into the birt runtime jar then - why can't those reside in seperate (optional) jars?

The emitter plugin idea sounds excellent, too.

We're neither using OSGI (so we're ""OSGI noobs"" as well :) ) therefore we would need a non-OSGI solution.
I don't think that there are many OSGI users out there when it comes to BIRT runtime integration (except for the designer itself).

Regarding guava - ideally BIRT should either get rid of guava or repackage it to avoid any conflicts for non-OSGI integration scenarios. I didn't find any explicit guava usages in BIRT - is guava required because of a transitive dependency? 

IMHO, resolving these issues should be a top-priority task as so many BIRT users would probably benefit from it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5XB1ur/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We use BIRT embedded in our application which is an OSGi environment. Ironically we don't use the `birt-runtime-osgi`  artifact but we embed the `birt-runtime` JAR in a reporting bundle of our own. The reason for this is that the OSGi runtime creates dependency hell within OSGi for us. So by embedding the normal runtime in a bundle we shield the rest of the OSGi environment from the BIRT deps. Now obviously this is very ""un-OSGi"". But with a solution as big as BIRT which pulls in so many dependencies it's very hard to manage. We did do it for a while like this, but there is really very little incentive to do so and very real pain ;-).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5XHPal/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It's more the kind of thing you need a full blog post for. 

Currently we use the Felix Bundle plugin to create the OSGi-fied manifest and use pax-runner to start during runtime. We are now using BIRT 4.4 and I'm actually in the process of upgrading it. 

The instructions below include all (transitive) dependencies which BIRT needs in to the bundle's JAR and only the bundle classloader is exposed to them. Our reporting bundle then exposes a much simpler API to the rest of the OSGi application. 

I don't actually know if the `fakeplugin` workaround is still needed. It might be a left over from the time we used the actual OSGi BIRT runtime.

Therefore, our ideal BIRT runtime would contain no db driver at all.

It is not on the roadmap.
I think really many people world-wide would benefit from PDF/UA support.

PDFs generated for authorities MUST support this in the EU.

But nobody is willing to pay for it. 
And it will be a lot of work, so it cannot be done by an enthusiastic hobby programmer.

Where are the big companies, where are the states, where is the EU?
IMHO this is a topic where it is necessary to actually *pay* for open source development.

From a technical point of view:

BIRT uses OpenPDF for PDF creation.
AFAIK OpenPDF does not support creating Tagged PDF which is a precondition for PDF/UA.
See https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/181

The BIRT community can only start developing PDF/UA support for BIRT after OpenPDF added support for it.

At least one tiny bit of preparation is included in BIRT:
There is a PDF tag type property. 
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644776/225864107-884381d5-5c5b-498d-8a4d-396f584d75a0.png)
This was certainly meant to assist creating tagged PDFs.
But AFAIK this property isn't actually used.

I don't know: Did the commercial BIRT product support creating tagged PDFs?

Internally, JasperReports uses OpenPDF just like BIRT (a patched version at the moment, see https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/765)

So, in contrast to what I said in my previous comment:

*It would certainly be possible to create PDF/UA with in BIRT.*

It's just that the OpenPDF community itself is not focused on this and doesn't provide examples.
But if JasperReports can do it, why shouldn't we?

Still, this is certainly a lot of work.

I was able to create a valid PDF/UA 1 document using the rather low-level functions of OpenPDF (validation done with the PAC 2021 validator).
The idea is that you create a structure tree containing the logical structure of the content (similar to basic HTML) and you link every content on the pages to one of these structure elements.
Basically, the structure elements correspond to the item instances.
So I really think it is possible to add this to BIRT.
But there is a lot to think about.
E.g. do we need to distinguish between locale and language; and while it is typical that a BIRT corresponds to a specific tag in the structure tree, this is not always the case, so this must be configurable.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5oF9KO/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I copied this to our companies fork today, so this is available at https://github.com/triestram-partner/birt/tree/tagged-pdf, in a very, very early stage.

I am able to create a PDF/UA file consisting of labels only (without any background colors or lines etc) which PAC 2024 accepts.

Currently I'm trying to add support for images, but PAC 2024 still reports one error for the resulting file.

The POC is demonstrating that it is in fact possible to generate PDF/UA with a modified version of BIRT and OpenPDF as the backend.  But there are lots of open issues. 
For example, I expect major challenges when it comes to page breaks and to HTML dynamic text items.
It might turn out that the simple concept of the implementation is not sufficient and we must start from scratch again, but I try to be optimistic.
That said, there are also a lot of tasks which should be relatively easy, but all of this certainly amounts to several weeks or months of work before it even can be beta-tested.

**This is definitely not something I (or anyone else) can develop all alone as a a hobby project, so I'm asking other developers for help.**

For this, I think it would make sense to create a branch tagged-pdf in the official repository. @wimjongman: Any objections?

Report properties:

- Specify a title.

- In the PDF emitter options, select
  - PDF version: 1.7
  - PDF conformance: PDF/A-1A
  - PDF/UA conformance (or version?): 1 (let's start with PDF/UA-1 support, PDF/UA-2 support can be added later)

Not sure, there may more settings necessary (regarding fonts), I'll upload an example report later when I'm at home.

For the layout elements, be sure to add appropriate PDF tags like `P` or `H1`.

Choose run report ... as PDF from the menu in the all-in-one-designer, download the PDF from your browser.
Use [PAC 2024](https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org) or another tool to validate the PDF.

I would **really much prefer** that you push changes to your own fork and create pull requests to kick off builds rather than push branches into the main repository.  

The workflow for how to do that is described here:

I.e., I don't expect to see a bunch of ""personal"" branches being built:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eff934e4-3cb1-470e-8976-307cb5ee0b76)

but rather PR builds:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fbc79af-91e0-47f0-8267-a8a61677c2ec)

Via the PRs there is a place to review and discuss changes.

You can easily amend your commits and force push to your fork to kick off new builds.  That's also described in the discuss above as well.

Your build is failing because it isn't based on master and hence has an older target platform referring to a p2 repository that no longer exists.

However, there is still very much to test and to code:

- I did not test splits of table rows (that includes splits of cells).
- I did not test splits of plain text or HTML text.
- I did not test grids and I don't know how ""forms"" should be handled regarding the strucure. Many of our report use a grid to show properties, e.g. for an order, with property name and property value, e.g. ""Order no: 24-12345"".
- I am not interested in charts.
- I am unsure how to handle HTML dynamic text (in particular, headings).
- I don't have a screen reader, only PAC 2024.
- While the structure is working for multi-page tables, I am not quite satisfied with the way I have coded this. I needed half a dozen new attributes for ContainerArea instances, which of course adds some bytes to the memory needed per instance and there are lots of such instances. This information is only needed when PDF/UA is created, so I think it would be better to move this into a separate object that is only allocated when actually needed.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6WNYX_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

- The prominent ""About"", ""Get started"", and ""Documentation"" areas have nothing clickable. Not the graphics, not the titles, not the descriptions. No links anywhere.
- I'm in Safari, maybe that's the problem. Nope, same thing in Chrome and Edge.
- Check Javascript console, sure enough, a Javascript error down in jquery. In Chrome that is, try Safari, no error. Oh well, I'm not going to debug this.

Also: the prominent ""Downloads"" button takes me to a page which states ""This page is not designed to be web-accessible"" and is not useful to a new user. (More on this later.)

Anyway, after getting nowhere with the prominent, obviously intended to be entry points areas, I did notice the equivalent links at the top of the page. ""Get started"" takes me to https://eclipse.github.io/birt-website/docs/installation. Right off, it says ""The BIRT download site is here"" and gives a link to the same page as mentioned above. So let's try to explore that a bit:

- Link to directory ""downloads"" seems more like what I want than ""update-site"", it only has a ""drops"" directory, which then contains directories that are obviously versions, so I try the one for 4.13.0. Ah, we have zip'd packages for different architectures, but do I need rcp-report-designer or report-designer-all-in-one??? Well, anyway, back to the installation page to read the documentation about what packages to get and how to install them. Except of course, the installation page provides *NO SUCH INFORMATION*.
- Let's see, there's a link to the sources, which in its README has a link to the same downloads above. Anyway, source is probably not what I want at this stage. So let's continue reading. ""Once you've downloaded your BIRT component, you need to install it. For instructions please continue reading..."" Well sure, except I don't know what to download. So let's continue reading, maybe there's a hint coming.
- ""If you have not yet done so, install Eclipse, GEF, EMF and BIRT. You'll find complete instructions for doing so on the BIRT Install page."" Wait, what? I thought I was on the BIRT install page. And notably, there is no linked text here leading to a different install page.
- ""Open BIRT. BIRT is a perspective within Eclipse...."" Well, I actually know that, and how to open perspectives. The problem is, you kind of skipped over the whole part about how to find and install it!
- But the next section is titled ""Designer Install"", so maybe the installation instructions here are just not sequenced really well; let's keep going.
- ""BIRT can be downloaded and installed in different ways:"" Ahhh, this must be the section we've been looking for!
- First option, exactly what I think I'm looking for: ""The complete BIRT designer or RCP Designer can be installed by downloading the required package here."" *THERE IS NO LINK!* None of the text is linked, there is no link after that bullet point.
- Second option: ""or by downloading the Eclipse IDE for Java and Report Developers Package."" Not really what I want, since I already have an Eclipse installation with some packages for another project. But again, no link!
- Third option: ""or through the update manager as described here..."" Sure, I could do that,, but again, no link! I think I'll try using the update manager, but... What site to add???
- Then, hilariously, the docs proceed to hand-hold a user through creating a shortcut on the desktop to Eclipse.
  - Not all BIRT users will be Windows users.
  - Not all Windows users want to pollute their desktops with shortcuts to all the applications they use.
  - It seems unlikely that BIRT will attract novice users who don't know how launch their apps.
  - It is so incongruous to stick this in here, after failing in so many different ways to tell us how to install BIRT.
- Anyway, maybe ""The Framework Designer Install"" section will be better. But nope.
- ""The Framework install requires that you already have the Eclipse Platform, GEF, EMF, DTP and WTP packages. The specific version of each, is listed on the specific build's download page."" Really. What downloads page? No link, of course.
- ""If you are installing the framework, you can download the BIRT framework and unzip the contents to any directory."" Download what from where? Again, no link. Maybe I should just get that ""report-designer-all-in-one"", unzip it, and try???

After all that, I start wonder if maybe I did want ""update-site"" instead of ""downloads"" from that ""yo, you shouldn't even be seeing this page"" page. So back to that, ""update-site"" contains versioned folders. And **LO!** clicking on 4.13.0 gets me *install instructions*. At last. As far as I can tell, a standard page provided for Eclipse repos--nothing provided by BIRT. Except that when I add that repo to Eclipse, I seem to only have SDK packages, not the report developer.

So I have spent most of the morning on this, and still have almost no clue how to get started.

And the solution of the space is given into 2 changes on your layout.
You will get the space due to the stanard padding of the cells and that your have drawn the cell-lines on each row.
Step 1 is to remove the padding (set to 0) and the second steps is to remove the top-line of the detail cells because your use the group-merge and so the grouping line will draw your above line.

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **hvbtup** April 11, 2023</sup>
Way back in 2013, some kind of support of the CSS `overflow` property was added to BIRT.

Unfortunately, the default in BIRT is `hidden` which is different from the CSS default `visible`.

This is causing me headache in the BIRT DOCX emitter, because the emitter respects this setting and thus long words get truncated.
A long word is a word that is too wide for the cell. This is not uncommon in German, e.g. ""Bundestagspräsident"".

Other users experienced the same issue.

See https://github.com/eclipse/birt/issues/1013 where I proposed a dirty workaround in the report.
I tried this workaround last week, but the designer would not accept the modified XML.
Anywy, even if it works, it is a really ugly workaround.

What makes things difficult here is that 
- The CSS specs say that this property is not inherited (which makes sense).
- The `overflow` property cannot be specified in a style in BIRT.

I think the latter is an incorrect consequence of the first point; the original developer probably thought: If it cannot be inherited anyway, so why use it in a style?
But IMHO this is a misconception and it absolutely makes sense to specify the property in a style.
We don't have *cascading* style sheets in BIRT anyway. With ""inheritance"", BIRT means that e.g. a property of a cell can be inherited from the same property at table level. So ""inheritable or not"" is only related to the layout element tree structure in BIRT, but not to inherited CSS classes.

I propose to make the following changes to BIRT and I'm asking you for your opinion here:

1) Change the default value for `overflow` to be `visible` instead of `hidden`.
2) Allow setting this property in the style editor.

Not sure about:
3) Allow overriding the default value for `overflow` with a RenderOption for the emitter, similar to PDF_WORDBREAK for the PDF emitter. 
4) Should we increase the version number of the RPTDesign XML file? I don't think this is needed. It's only a changed default value, and probably 99% of all BIRT reports don't care about this anyway.

Note: The PDF emitter needs emitter options to support this. I'm always using

	options.setOption(IPDFRenderOption.PAGE_OVERFLOW, IPDFRenderOption.OUTPUT_TO_MULTIPLE_PAGES);
	options.setOption(IPDFRenderOption.PDF_TEXT_WRAPPING, true);
	options.setOption(IPDFRenderOption.PDF_WORDBREAK, true);

Well done!

 

How can I repair my 120 old templates?

Each of them has hundreds of labels, datas, and texts with Overflow = Hidden (hard coded, not inherited).

I opened some of them in Visual Studio Code and deleted all appearances of : 

<property name=""overflow"">hidden</property>

using “Replace All”.

This works and restores inheritance.

Is there an easier way to achieve the same result?

based on the discussion (#1263) and my reserach I saw an eclipse hint that the usage of **""AccessController.doPrivileged()""**
is **deprecated and marked for removal** in an upcoming Java version.
I checked the latest documentation of JDK 20 and the class is given and listed again ""only"" like deprecated.
Afterwards I check the BIRT-master and we have over 100entries with the usage of doPrivileged()-call,
e.g.:

- FunctionProviderBaseImpl (2times)
- SecurityUtil (34times)

The final question is the action according of this fiding:

1. **Nothing/remain** and we will wait thill the method is removed in full
2. Remove the calls **without** special privileged grant handling
3. Remove the calls **with** special privileged grant handling

I haven't any idea of option 3 because currently there is no replacement or newer Verson of the SecurityManager in planning.
So it seems to me that option 1 or 2 would be the way. My favorit would option 2.

Any opinions are welcome to this point of security and the next steps.

Example according point 2.:
```
	public void setApplicationClassLoader(final ClassLoader appLoader, Context context) {
		if (appLoader == null) {
			return;
		}
		ClassLoader loader = appLoader;
		try {
			appLoader.loadClass(""org.mozilla.javascript.Context"");
		} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
			**loader = (new RhinoClassLoaderDecoration(appLoader, FunctionProviderImpl.class.getClassLoader()));**
		}
		context.setApplicationClassLoader(loader);
	}

So for me is important to talk about the option and the change so that we are fine with it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5aHXZI/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Can you explain what option 3 would look like? Do you mean something like:
Create a new class `org.eclipse.birt.security.AccessController` which is a dummy implementation of AccessController and just *always allows* doPrivileged, and replace the imports of java.security.AccessController with org.eclipe.birt.security.AccessController throughout BIRT's source code?

This would make sense if we think that the future will bring a replacement for AccessController.

But I don't think so, so I'd still choose option 2.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5aKH3p/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Which version do you need exactly BIRT 4.10 - 4.13 or have you all versions tested?
If you could provide a small example without database & library dependencies we are able to reproduce and debug the issue.
ALso the full stack trace would be helpful.

Is the mentioned class ""com.binaryfortis.data.xls.XlsHelper"" a special provider / programmed extension from your side

**For OSGi runtimes 4.10/11/13**: We analyzed the issue and we could see that issue is due to **com.github.librepdf.openpdf_1.3.26** jar(present in platform/plugins). Inside this jar **MANIFEST.MF** has **Export-Package** and **Import-Package** which uses **javax.annotation**.
When we remove this **javax.annotation** from **MANIFEST.MF** for both Export and Import package. We could see emitters loaded properly e.g PDF, Word etc. and there were no error inside configuration folder as well. 

Please let us know, if this can be a patch fix for 4.13 release and can be permanently fixed in upcoming release.

1-  In order to solve the issue, **com.github.librepdf.openpdf_1.3.26** jar (present in platform/plugins) needs to be upgraded by  **com.github.librepdf.openpdf_1.3.27 jar** as  **javax.annotation** is removed from Import/Export package.

There are few places that we identified as a place to change to update the com.github.librepdf.openpdf dependency version-

4- /org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

If above four places are correct then let us know else let us know from where we can update this dependency version in BIRT project to get the upgraded one(openpdf 1.3.27) in **platform/plugins**

### Description
The setup should produce a usable workspace amenable to contribution. The target platform should be modernized to use newer dependencies; ideally it should be easier to maintain it and to update it to newer dependencies in the future.  It should be easier (possible) to do local Tycho builds.  It should be easier to produce nightly, milestone, and release builds.  There appear to be too many products (*.product) and too many update sites (category.xml).  It's not clear why those are all needed and who all consumes those.  Simplification and reduction of these would help streamline the releng process. 

Perhaps the EPP Eclipse IDE for Java and Report Developers could be revived, but the build results are of a quality not consumable by SimRel:

This is what's published for the most recent release:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/44c41937-5e8b-47bb-b95c-74e3e6497fb1)

There is a **single** update site:

https://download.eclipse.org/birt/update-site/4.13.0/

So I think there are just two products there along with some other zips that I have yet to understand their content and purpose, and there is only a single update site...

So while the build produces many more products and site, these aren't published currently.

A goal here is to streamline the production of the site as well as any/all useful/necessary associated packaged results.   I will make the assumption that things not currently leading to published results are not needed in the build and that no one is relying on building such things themselves directly.  I want to state that assumption explicitly so that someone can contradict it if it's wrong.

BTW, it will be much easier for me/us if I have commit rights such that I can help with things such as target platform updates, 
enabling more tests, including managing their shared launch configurations so you can easily run them in the IDE, setting up build jobs and so on.   I got most of the tests working now, except the UI tests, because I'm not sure they will run on the server without some configuration.   Also, I gave up on this test because there are so many errors and failures and I don't understand well what they are testing:

I am under the impression that BIRT is working towards a 4.14 release.  But the POM, feature, and bundle versions are all (mostly all) still 4.13.  I want to manage updating these easily in a more automated way so I'm analyzing the current state of all the versions.

Once thing that seems a little concerning to me is the class/jar files in the Git repository:

- https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/tree/master/common/javax.xml.rpc/javax/xml/rpc
- https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/tree/master/common/org.apache.axis/lib
- https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/tree/master/common/org.apache.derby.core
- https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/tree/master/common/org.w3c.sac/lib

I only noticed these because they don't have 4.13 versions, which makes sense.

I have positive impression from using this magic. Two things to mention:
1) for ""release"" builds it is not yet clear for me how it could be ""tailored"" with legacy releases that project already has.

I could try that again, but in this case, it's much trickier with all these special download artifacts because those are recorded as repository properties during the promotion process, so it's not easy to manage applying it to an older release.  Do you think that's important or can we make a fresh start in the new location leaving the other stuff where it is right now for a while?

Nightly builds are self cleaning.  The `-retain 5` argument specifies the cutoff number to retain.  The milestone builds are also self cleaning.  As soon a milestone is published with a higher branding version `-version-iu org.eclipse.birt.feature` all the current milestones are deleted and that new one with the new higher version becomes the only child at that point, so assuming that one doesn't build milestones for years without increasing versions, that should be limiting.  If necessary an option to limit the number could be implemented.

The retention policy is documented on the sites:

I have seen that the new version avoid the creation of the test segments like before.
So all tests will be handled during the complete build process.
These test segments had 2 functions:
1. organize the test process into chapters and so we get an structured test organization
2. the next segment will only be started if the segements are done before successfully

On my failed build of the weekend I saw that the build process go through till the end,
create all zip-files and so on. But at the end the process figured out that there was an test failure.

At the end the full build process runs longer like the version before due to the changed error handling and we loss the test segmentation.

Therefore my questions:
- Is there an option to improve the handling to stop on failure of unit tests?
- And does anyone miss the test segment imformation?

The important topic for me is the failure handling that the process tries to stop after an test failure was detected.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5eBrxB/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This can also cause things to run that otherwise wouldn't run at all.   That can of course be removed and then the build will stop as soon as one test fails.  That has the advantage that the first failure can be noticed more quickly and the disadvantage that if 5 different test suites/projects have failures, you won't notice a second failure until you've fixed the first one so you might need to do 5 builds before you get that far (which is why I changed it so that I could run the full build and know about all the failures while testing the huge number of changes that I had made.)   But it's probably good to change it back again now.  Note that without the ""segmentation""  in the ci.yml, the tests run much earlier in the build; in the past they ran after the full build...","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5eDh37/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We should make a fresh start. 

We can archive all the old bits. The redirection that the foundation has made will make sure that download requests are forwarded to the archives. 

I have archived everything except the last two releases already and had little complaints. So from 4.14 onwards, we can use the new approach/website.

where the user can navigate to whatever they are most interested and can get at the downloads if they wish, e.g., here the latest release, which is currently 4.13.0 and provides the linked downloads:

The experience of our support of the project and my experiences avid to delete the archive. 
There are many infrastructure dependencies over all versions.
For example you cannot force to change by default based on the BIRD project to move to latest Java version.
I remember on our unsolved issue with Rhino and Java 11 vs 17.
So yes, it make sense to have the archive.

It is the index.jsp of the birt viewer.

Thanks for your investigation on it, yes the apache poi has many dependencies. So it could be if we would have a newer version on BIRT side we have to change/optimize some project parts e.g. the excel emitters of (own & spudsoft)

The results differ: now they all redirect to birt main site, https://eclipse-birt.github.io/birt-website/. That includes the link mentioned by the OP above (in 2023) and for any of them, starting with the first, ""product catalog"", which tries to go to https://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/examples/solution/ProductCatalog.html but again simply redirects back to the site front page. 

Indeed, it's as if some global rewrite changes anything URL starting with eclipse.org/birt to eclipse-birt.github.io/birt-website/, but it does it without regard to offering a CORRECT specific page to redirect to--nor does the rewrite distinguish between a legit previous link or not. For example, using https://www.eclipse.org/birt/bob also just redirects back to that front page.

Finally, if someone may say ""_just download the templates, as offered via the 'you can simply download all reports and their templates here' link on that page_"", sadly that fails also. The [page it links to](https://eclipse-birt.github.io/birt-website/template-download) offers a link which itself also fails: https://eclipse-birt.github.io/static/templates/BIRT-templates-download_V4.9.zip.

I have been excluded as an Eclipse committer as my company doesn’t agree on Eclipse’s “new” committer agreements. I feel sorry for this but cant change it.

The main issue was that we asked to be able to withdraw committed code for some restricted time if any failure occurred on our side in committing the code accidently. “Erare humanum est” – well I guess in Eclipse’s community everybody is error free…

For this reason I beg you to get in touch with Wim who certainly will answer to your request.

Me for my part have migrated in our company to the newest docusaurus version with which we are happy as it is a lot faster than the older ones.

well, I think you haven’t read my request carefully enough.

I understand your argumentation and it is completely correct, but if you detect an error while transporting your code to Eclipse you may want to with draw it or in other words not commit the transaction.
The case I discussed with Eclipse some years ago was that code which is not under discloser might be transported accidentally. This brings the committer in a terrible situation as he now personally responsible towards his employer and could mean his personal insolvency although that he detects his error while transporting the code to Eclipse.

I believe it is good practice not to describe suggestions of third parties as ridiculous, but rather to ask why a proposition is made, so that a common understanding of the issue can emerge.

With all my respectful regards
Chris

We discussed the question of whether we want to continue using open source intensively last year. As is often the case with such complex issues, there were both pros and cons.

One of the main problems we have with open source is the long-term compatibility of the different versions of the various frame works and the Java versions to be used. We want to investigate this year to what extent we can solve this issue more skillfully than before. Which OS-prject can we rely on and which not? What are the characteristics of reliable OS-projects? Etc.

I don't think I need to go into this any further, because the discussion has been going on for a long time and the arguments are well known. Our aim is to examine this specifically for our application example of ERP for retail and to find a suitable solution.

Best
Chris

I read ""withdraw committed code"" literally as stated.

That's worded differently.  This doesn't suggest to be able to ""withdraw a commit"" but rather to ""not commit the transaction"".  I don't know exactly what a ""transaction"" is, but a ""commit"" is well defined...

> The case I discussed with Eclipse some years ago was that code which is not under discloser might be transported accidentally.

""Transported"" also is not so well defined in my mind.  Maybe that's like wanting to unsend an already-sent email?

I'd not like to work for your employer.  I wonder now though, the concern you state here is a personal one relative your relation with your company but you represented the issue originally as ""my company doesn’t agree"".

Yes, sorry for calling it ""kind of ridiculous"" rather than simply pointing out that it's effectively impossible to transform an actual commit into something that never happened.   Aborting transactions or undoing transports is something else, but I have no idea concretely to what that might refer.  The content of a PR maybe?  Even a PR can have been applied before was deleted, if such deletion were permitted...

While looking at best practices I will assume that saying  ""I guess in Eclipse’s community everybody is error free"" is meant as tongue-in-cheek satire rather than a obliquely insulting comment that somewhat misrepresents the problem space.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6c_QUc/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

sorry for my very dry humor, but I thin you have understood it 😉

My suggestion was, that the transfer of code to Eclipse might be done in two stepps:


  1.  Transfer of code in a protected area, so that the transferred artifacts can be checked, if they correspond to what shall be committed.

  2.  Once the control is OK, my be protected by a password for a second person, it can be committed and is available for the rest of the world.

As long the transferred artifacts are not committed they can be withdrawn, changed what so ever, but the rest of the world does participate.

Of course you could argue that this might be done at the committers side, but then the transfer process itself could also be buggy and then not be corrected.

In our company we life what we call in Germany a 4-eye principle to avoid fatal mistakes as far as possible and we are requested to respect this principle.

Best regards
Chris

- The error is also reproducable with our latest repository sources.
- The direct call of emitters (HTML, PDF, etc. works correctly.)

I started a very small sensitive improvement of the BIRT-viewer.
Since I started the BIRT usage 2017 I had the same preview with a little bit old fashioned style.

On my one viewer I had updated the coloring, the main function icons and the parameter icons.
Now I wants to push these changes to the BIRT-master.

But before I start a PR here you can see the sensitive styling changes.
There are only changes on coloring and 8 icons (no master renew).

The main change is that I removed the beige-light-brown through a blue color and a very light gray of the dialog.
I know that the most use and own integration and styling can be a very sensitive topic,
but I think it would be good to have small changes after a so long time.

Please let me know your comments - The icons created on my own (no foreign icons).


### Styling compare - Left side ""current version""  / Right side ""renewed version""

The FlattenedListHandler called by the emitter does not implement the startTable() function from AbstractHandler.
I have read in some previous threads that HTMLTable is not supported, however, ideally the report generation shouldn't be broken altogether.

Now I noticed that in some cases, the PDF rendering does not work as expected.

E.g. instead of collapsing space between syllables when a soft hyphen is hidden, there is a space between them.

I am working on a fix for this [here](https://github.com/triestram-partner/birt/tree/fix-SHY) and I had it sorted out, but when I tried to merge the latest commits from master, this made the build fail. Once this is solved, I'll create a PR.

Besides these errors, I noticed some other rendering issues which are not related to the SHY support, which I was not able to fix easily:

First issue:
When we are using letter spacing or if letter spacing is added automatically as a result of text-align: justify in case of a line containing a single word, and when a single word uses different styles (e.g. ""**Kinder**garten""), then the letter spacing is missing between the two word fragment (between ""r"" and ""g"" in this example).

Second issue:
In some cases using text with different styles, a ""Word"" returned to the ""TextCompositor"" can start with white space. If this is the first word in a line, the white space should be omitted, but it isn't, thus the line looks incorrectly indented.

Third issue:
This is somewhat the opposite of the second issue:
If a text/data/label item _starts with white space_, then in my opinion this white space should _not_ be omitted, because we don't know if it there _intentionally_. And in such cases I think the data should be shown as-is, o the readers can notice and decide themself.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1313/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

<sup>Originally posted by **redkark** June  8, 2023</sup>
I observe high memory usage when using Spudsoft Emitter while generate XLSX output for larger data volumes. I am using the BIRT runtime v4.12 in my Java code to generate the reports. I looked at certain posts where it was suggested to use the ExcelEmitter.Extract in the render options to instruct the spudsoft emitter to use the ""streaming"" SXSSFWorkbook from Apache POI. However it did not have desired effect. Upon looking at the code for XslxEmitter, I noticed it uses the XSSFWorkbook with no option provided to switch to the SXSSFWorkbook. Would like to know if it is possible to configure spudsoft emitter to make use of the SXSSSFWorkbook, via the render options or other mechanisms?</div>","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1322/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The important thing is that the usage of XSSF and SXSSF isn't the same so the default would be the current handling with XSSF without streaming. The streaming must beactivated with ExcelEmitter.StreamingXlsx = ""true"".

no, I am not running two different sessions on the Tomcat server.

I just explained in an earlier message that I just copied data into web apps folder which is present on the other server and it has birt older version like 2.5.1. in this data folder no birt.war file is present but it is using an older version of the homepage.

You say in one of the comments that the stacktrace probably does not belong to a 4.13 instance since that one is ""running fine"".

This is a complete status of manager apps

you can see that there is two link name **birt** and **bank**  both displaying together with upper and lower direction.

birt has a new version 4.13 and it successfully launched its test report.

when I come on the bank link it shows this home page

i test this example link then it shows a fatal error

so that's why said trace is not belong to 4.13 because it is working fine.

according to my understanding if I put two **birt.war** files into different folders so Tomcat creates multiple sessions against two files.

if I am mistaken on this point then please correct me.

I have only one birt.war file into the web apps folder.

I am using the following BIRT version : org.eclipse.birt.runtime_4.8.0-20180626
I have a requirement where I need to make dynamic columns. There are required fields which are written in the application and for each one of them there needs to be a separate column with the parameter name as a header and the parameter value as a info row. I have knowledge only with Scripted Data Source, but the struggle has been real :) 
Please provide me with a solution
P.S. Every kind of data migration will work except JDBC connection.

My interpretation of what you want is:

There are N data records.
The report should output a table with a header row and N detail rows. 
Until here this would be easy: Use a table item.
However, the number of columns, and which column should show which attribute of a record, is dynamic.
In other word, the sequence of attribute names and their correspondings titles is dynamic.
E.g. a ""persons"" report might output the columns [""name"", ""birthday""] now and [""gender"", ""name"", ""weight""] for a different call.

I think there are 2 potential approaches:

1) You could use a crosstab item.
2) You use a table item with the maximum possible number of columns you expect. Then use visibility expressions to hide the columns that you don't need.

A little more info regarding the second approach:

Assume that in your report there is an array variable ""columns"" which you initialize dynamically e.g. with 

    vars[""columns""] = [""gender"", ""name"", ""weight""];

In your table item, you would hide all columns (uising a visiblity expression) where the (1-based) column index is >= columns.length. For the other columns (that are not hidden), you need dynamic text items for the titles and for the values.
E.g. for the output in the third column you would use the dynamic text expression

    row[vars[""columns""][2]] 

(2 instead of 3 because Javascript arrays are 0-based).

The column titles in the header row can be handled in a similar way (e.g. if you have a variable column_titles = [""Geschlecht"", ""Name"", ""Gewicht""], you could use the following expression for the 3rd column:

    vars[""column_titles""][2]

to show the titel ""Gewicht"".

- Tomcat 9.0.52, Java 17.0.5+8 Eclipse Adoptium

What I not understand on the eror log is the origin, is it an Tomcat issue or may be a missing dependency topic of BIRT 4.14.0 (because 4.13.0 is running)
Main error:

On my research I found the following article which is very old and at the end, have we here a task for the new built process to add missing dependencies or is it realy a Tomcat configuration issue.

Perhaps you have an idea to solve the issue with the built process optimization (#1286) when it is a dependency topic.

But of course there are things missing.  I think this has not been maintained for a long time; several of the things it's trying to copy are not present.

Also, the tests that test the OSGi runtime current fail for cases of nested jars and that what this build.xml stuff is doing.

So my guess is that any jar in the plugins folder or lib folder that relies on nested jars will fail and that there are arbitrary ""missing"" things because the product used to build the  OSGi runtime is not using the osgi runtime feature.

Can anyone say when is the last time that this actually worked?  The 4.13 zip doesn't look better.

This feels like a bit of a head bang exercise given I can't easily determine if what's produced is correct.

If we want to supply a BIRT OSGi runtime it should happen using a normal tycho build. There is also a non-osgi runtime. 


What the runtimes do is to headlessly run a BIRT report. Speculating, I can say that people can add drivers, etc.. to the runtime by either supplying them as bundles (osgi runtime) or by adding them into a libs folder for the non-osgi runtime.

Thanks for your investigation on it.
To clarify, yes the BIRT OSGI-version is in used through the community latest responses to your call of usage.
And till version 4.13.0 it runs on my Tomcat.
So the latest official release of March 2023 works well.

Before the built change was started according my notes of my issue the version
birt-runtime-osgi-4.14.0-20230604 was running as well, but with the issue what on the HTML-viewer-page (what is fixed).

IIRC basically the files contained in the OSGI runtime were the same as in the POJO runtime, only with a different file-system layout, and apart from that the only difference is the presence of an env variable BIRT_HOME, which decides during the startup which startup routine is actually called.

I think both of the ""runtimes"" serve 3 different purposes:
1) Running a single report from the command line (e.g. from any Non-Java program)
2) Embed the runtime into an existing Java application, allowing to run multiple reports in parallel from that application (we could call the application a ""BIRT server"" then)
3) Using BIRT from a Java web server (accessing reports per http), e.g. in comparison to 2), the ""server functionality"" is built in.

Personally I only use 2), and the main difference is - as far as I understand it - that the POJO runtime supports 2) and 3) for good old Java application relying on the class path specified as an environment variable or command-line option, whereas the OSGI runtime supports the same for OSGI applications.

BTW, Non-Java applications don't care about OSGI anyway, so we could for remove 1) from the OSGI runtime (that is, remove the shell script), and document that for running reports from the command line, the POJO runtime can be used.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5foLom/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The test for the POJO runtime actually runs but the test is combined into a single project that tests both runtimes as if they are kind of identical.   I don't get the logic behind that, but the tests stopped being run long ago...

It may well be that newer dependencies depend on additional things or that different dependency versions break assumptions in Ant scripts that quietly don't complain.

I don't know how to do that.  I'm not sure how many hours I have to spend to learn how to set up manual testing infrastructure.  Keep in mind that this is not my job and that my volunteer time (and patience) is bounded.

Firstly, I don't know what this means.  Secondly, this is something that someone with knowledge of the semantics of these things must answer, not someone running builds.  Of course my naive guess would be that something in the whole Zip-folder is missing from the WebViewerExample folder, but that seems evident.  I've already asked things like what does the lib folder mean versus the plugins folder because I see build scripts copying stuff from the latter to the former; build scripts that look broken though maybe have been broken for a long time.

I don't know if that used to work?  My sense is that this hasn't worked in perhaps quite some time.  There are some fundamental class loader problems bootstrapping the OSGi runtime.  In particular the Platform class is loaded by ReportRunner from its URL class loaded, but then later later another instance of Platform.class is loaded by OSGi using a plugin class loaded, so the static Platform.platform is never set on the Platform class seen by the ReportRunner because it's a different copy of the class.  So I think this has nothing to do with the content of these folders but rather a problem in the underlying implementation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5fxHRZ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This evening I tested the lates built:

- birt-runtime-4.14.0-202306261418
- birt-runtime-osgi-4.14.0-202306261418

Both only at Windows side (without X-systems) with Tomcat 9 and Java 17, test sequence of both runtimes:

- step 01: WebViewer = successful
- step 02: birt.war = successful
- step 03: command-line = successful

And of course the command lines are working at Windows side:

- example of the ""genReport.bat"", report is our ""hello_world""-report:

These are supported technically by using nested tables (in the Word output) for almost everything.
In the tup_main branch of my fork I am trying to reduce these nested tables. This makes the generated output files more suitable for human post-editing. OTOH this results in reduced control of the layout.
While I am happy with the output my patched version generates (with the help of some user properties), there are other differences to the official BIRT release (in particular regarding Excel output), so you cannot just try the fork and assume that everything works as expected.

From the experience with my fork, I think it might be useful to review and discuss some of the changes I made, and maybe merge them into the master branch after making the behavior change optional (e.g. it would be necessary to explicitly opt-in to the changes by setting a render option or whatever.

However, I don't have enough time to do this myself.
It may be useful if you @MSDelorme and others who are interested would try out the tup_main branch and tell me what you think about the output, as a first steep to see if anyone likes the approach at all.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5f8xcx/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I was in the same situation several times.

I would say that for *most* things you can use the workaround you mentioned (with a hidden layout element bound to a data set), and I think that this workaround is pretty reasonable. I tend to use red font color to mark these ""logic in the layout"" and our reports usually don't output red text, so the developer sees immediately that some logic is happening here.

This workaround doesn't work in all cases.
E.g. once I wanted to modify and populate a grid (including removing columns etc), with input coming from the DB.
I was able to use the DE API to basically clone the existing Data Source and create a Data Set in the beforeFactory(?) event of the report, but while I was able to create a connection, I was not able to read the report parameter values.
I remember that I thought: If only there was a way to open and execute a data set from Javascript within the report (at a stage where I also can access the report parameters).

to add the option of the types ""date"", ""datetime-local"" and ""time"" to the parameter-dialog.

The plan is to use the standard behavior of the browser based on the input-tag.
Therefore the display of the datepicker is dependent on the browser-implementation. The browser Chrome & Edge (Chromium based) will have the best support by standard (without additional libraries). The browser FirFox will sho only the date-picker without support of datetime- and time-picker.

But it will be a good improvement and we will also be able to add a better date-picker-library later in a next step.

The plan is not to change the JSP-fragment by default. The better way is that we will have new options on eclipse-dialog of the parameters based on the data type to select an additional kind of display ""Display As"".

I reviewed your changes and there is a main difference to my version.
You have defined a new display type for the parameter ""DATE_CTRL"".
My version instead is based on new ""Display As""-style type and the display type keeps a textbox.
With the display-style I handle all version of date, datetime, time and the according options of only date w/ or w/o time picker and the version of short or long time picker.

I would prefer the ""Display As""-version. Do you thought about this way?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5gsiOQ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This option has the value potion of ""static"" value list, but the ""dynamic"" value list is disabled.

My reports have the requirement to use client-based values which are different between the clients (= business clients).

https://dlm.mariadb.com/browse/java8_connector/138/1681/connector-java-2.7.9/	  	

It is working fine because Birt is connected successfully as I provide a snapshot in this thread.

I am using non-OSGI runtime. if I use OSGI runtime BIRT 4.14 then do I not need to define classpath on C:

a snapshot was taken from the Linux machine and installed eclipse 2023 was in it and used BIRT report designer from Eclipse and design test report but db connection was fine as I mentioned earlier in this thread and on runtime it displayed jdbc error that I mentioned in above snapshots.

when I tried this from a Windows machine to connect db (Mariadb version 10.15) that exists on Linux machine BIRT report designer it didn't get a db connection successful.

CLASSPATH=C:\your-application-class.abc.jar;...;C:\birt-runtime\ReportEngine\lib\*;C:\instantclient\ojdbc8.jar

where should I exactly define this classpath I mean on which file or do I need to define this setting in global variables of windows 10 machine?

another thing is that does it require an ojdbc8.jar file and needs to be downloaded?

do both Platform Linux and Windows require ojdbc8.jar in order to run rptdesign file?

<my tomcat path>\webapps\birt\WEB-INF\platform\plugins\org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc_4.14.0.v202306261418\drivers
The driver must be copied there.

For Non-OSGI-version you can try to put the driver directly there:
<my tomcat path>\webapps\birt\WEB-INF\lib
Because all jars there will be loaded with the start of the application server.

To your test of the driver version, it isn't a good way to add 2 driver-type in different versions to the driver manager because sometimes it causes internal conflicts. (Not on all jdbc-drivers but some of it can cause such conflicts.)
The next point is to the missing class name on the selection list. This isn't an issue of BIRT this a topic of the driver-jar to implements a public method to sho the class name.
This is alos the reason why the selection list is a ""ComboBox"" and not a pur ""SelectionList"". So you have to figure out the standard class name of the driver class and can add it there.
I use this way on special MS SQL drivers because not all drivers supports this public class name.

it worked on Linux I copied both files one by one but mariadb-java-client-2.7.9.jar worked out and reports are working on Linux machine. I deleted all extra Java drivers as you said that It might cause conflict with other drivers.

please note that all processes were done on a Linux machine.

now I am doing the same process from the Windows machine and trying to establish a data connection from the Birt data source but it showing an error. the database does not exist on the Windows machine it is present on a remote machine and MariaDB is running on the remote machine(Linux).

I copied same jar file on a Windows machine which I copied on the Linux machine to establish a data connection and for running reports smoothly.

I have done it in two ways to add a driver first I added a driver through driver manager from birt designer and when it didn't work I manually copied this driver to Eclipse folder but no luck.

It didn't understand what the target in full it seems to me to improve the exception message to get it more readable.

But I was interested on the main reason of the issue, so I veryfied the testing report at the communication and started a deep research.
And the reason of the exception is I think an ""old""-topic/""known error"". The reason is that the query cannot be executed if the BIRT-parameter of a query-parameter is null.
The most common way is here to use an optional parameter and set him to ""null value"" (then we will get the exception).

The technical cause of the exception is the implementation of the jdbc-method on the prepared statement to set the ""null"" value with ""isNull()"". The problem there is that the parameter type should be fetched to set the value but the current implementation won't be supported through Oracle with the ojdbc-driver:

relevant implementation line at class ""Statement"", method ""setNull"":
`this.preStat.setNull(parameterId, pm.getParameterType(parameterId));`

My suggestion to fix it would be to use the standard way which supports oracle in combination with the current version.

I remember when I debugged this back then, it seemed to me that BIRT wasn't able to detect the type correctly.
Which confused me, because it should be straightforward to determine the parameter type without magic type because the type is defined in the rptdesign. But then again, it's Javascript...

The idea to test it with an optional report parameter is good, however, please test it with a sub-report, too:

Say with we have a table PERSONS containing colums ID (as primary key), NAME, MOTHER_ID, FATHER_ID
(First test: The ID columns are VARCHAR2(10), second test: The ID columnd are NUMBER(10).
For most persons, MOTHER_ID and FATHER_ID are set.
For an orphan, MOTHER_ID and FATHER_ID are NULL.
For other persons, maybe only the FATHER_ID is NULL.

Now we want to create a report like this:

Outer report: DataSet persons 
    SELECT *
    FROM PERSONS
    ORDER BY NAME

Inner report: DataSet parents
    WITH  params AS (SELECT ? AS MOTHER_ID, ? AS FATHER_ID FROM DUAL)
    SELECT persons.NAME,
                CASE persons.ID 
                WHEN params.MOTHER_ID then 'Mom'
                WHEN params.FATHER_ID then 'Dad'
                END as relation
    FROM params CROSS JOIN persons
    WHERE persons.ID IN (params.MOTHER_ID, params.FATHER_ID)
    ORDER BY relation

This DataSet needs two dataset parameters.

Let's use a Table Item for the persons dataset.
Add a new column.
Drop the parents dataset into the empty detail cell.
In the DataSet parameter dialog, use row[""MOTHER_ID""]  and row[""FATHER_ID""] for the two dataset parameters.

Test if the report works correctly for orphans or if one of the two parents is null.

The BIRT-loop works also with NULL-columns. This was working in BIRT-versions before because I figured out that here is the internal parameter definition of the prepared statement available and the original ""setNull()""-method can be used.
(I researched it with the debugger,
be aware to avoid confusing: the parameter definition here is the definition of the SQL parameter meta data (JDBC/ODA) which is not the same object like BIRT-parameter-definition).

The good news the change will fixed such special kind of unaccessible NULL-column type
and the existing behavior is also given and will work.

So I will create a PR for it.

You ought to provide some level of detail.  E.g., where exactly are you seeing this?  It's really easy to copy and paste screen captures...

@speckyspooky 

One thing I found very questionable is the following approach of  copying Maven jars and embedding them as libraries in bundles: 

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/8c7bce8f-703b-4a36-86ac-98a9e67fc5c3)

This _might be_ the probably which which @rajn refers, though I can't be sure.    In think in an OSGi runtime this is maybe not a big deal because the bundle does not export the packages of these libraries, but in a ""flattened"" non-OSGi runtime this could end up surfacing an **ancient** version of guava.  It's doing some funky thing that I don't understand:

I take a look into the lib-folder of your screens and the jar files are very very old versions.
The most of them are not longer supported and have better versions.

The way of the usage at libary together with the plugin configuration (extention point) seems to me the try to have the lib-jars accessable at the script context. Because it makes only sence in this way. But this has nothing to do with ""real""-PlugIn dependecies.

I don't understand the build process really, but to me it seems that the folder 
`build\birt-packages\birt-runtime\target\package\ReportEngine\lib` which is the base for generating the ZIP, 
now contains a lot of files which, judging them by their names, seem to be irrelevant for the runtime 
and instead related to the UI only, e.g. files like `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core_0.14.100.v20230701-0639.jar`.

Disclaimer: I've seen this in the `tup_main` branch of my fork, but I'm pretty sure this happens with the `master` branch as well.

It could take much work to figure how how to do it differently, i.e, to figure how else to ensure that the runtime is complete without being ""over complete by adding missing things to /org.eclipse.birt.engine.runtime/feature.xml until the other feature can be removed from the product without breaking the runtimes.

The font aliasing is working for statically formatted items and it's working when we set BIRT CSS style properties dynamically,
but it is *not working for styling using the HTML style attribute* `style='font-family:""Arial""'`.

A little background:

On MS Windows, using the Arial font for subsetting it into PDFs is not a problem, because it's usually part of Windows anyway, and the license allows it.

On other OSes like Linux, Arial is not preinstalled, and I'm not sure if it ok to just copy the *.ttf files from a Windows machine.
The Liberation Sans font is designed in such a way that it can be used as a good replacement (not looking exactly the same, but the same metrics).
The reports have originally be designed on and for MS Windows, thus every single report uses the Arial font.
Now I want to let BIRT run on Linux (in a Podman virtualization).

That's why I need the font aliasing.

Some of the reports show HTML formatted text which is stored in database column.
These texts sometimes contain `style='font-family:""Arial""'` HTML attributes, because our users are used to use Arial and don't think about possible licensing issues.

**So what I basically need is the font aliasing working for HTML font-family CSS attributes as well.**

I'm not sure if we can call this a bug, though, because that's only what I'd need for our application in this situation.

Others might say that using HTML style attributes for selecting the font is very different, because the font aliasing was meant to design a report *here* and let it run *there* (in a different environment), and it should look the same if possible, whereas HTML text containing HTML CSS font-family is specified on a different level and the current behavior is more browser-like.

The possible workarounds I see for our application are:

a) update the existing data once, replacing the HTML CSS font-family attributes according to our aliasing map, and change the editor UI, replacing ""Alias with ""Liberation Sans"" in the drop-down list of fonts.
b) Modify the *.rptdesign files etc, basically doint the first part of a) on the fly before handing the text over to the dynamic text item.

Anyway, it would be nice if we could opt-in for using the font-aliasing map for rendering HTML CSS font-family, too.

Hello Henning, I investigated a little bit on your topic and may be there is a way which you could use without a change of BIRT.
I don't know why I didn't remember on it directly but you use the BIRT element ""Dynamic Text"".
If you would use the element ""Text"" with the attributes ""Dynamic Text"" and Text-Interpretation ""HTML"" it will work without any changes of BIRT.

I have done s small test report based on your logic and the CSS-styles will be added also on PDF.

The issue at hand is that font substitution as defined in using `fontConfig.xml` is not working.

You can only see this if your runtime environment is different from your development environment,
because inside the development environment you can only choose fonts that *are* available anyway.

But availability may not be given at runtime (in my example, Arial is missing on Linux), so that's when font substitution steps in.

So I tested it in another combination. I used ""Helvetica"" on my report because this font isn't installed on my (Windows-)server.
The span-tag used the style-attribute ""font-family:Arial;"". The result was like yours that ""Times-Roman"" was used.
Next step, I added the font-mapping into ***fontConfig.xml*** with the following line:

```
<mapping name=""Helvetica"" font-family=""Arial"" />
```

But the mapping wasn't used. I started a debug research of the code where the CSS-attributes will be fetched.
The result was that the Mapping name must be ""lower"" instead of ""normal""/""UpperCamelCase"" notation.
(The font-family-attribute is fine.)
My retest with the following mapping was successfull on my pdf-result:

```
<mapping name=""helvetica"" font-family=""Arial"" />
```

Could you try please the same configuration with lower case:
```
	<mapping name=""arial narrow"" font-family=""Liberation Sans Narrow"" />
	<mapping name=""arial black"" font-family=""Roboto Black"" />
	<mapping name=""arial"" font-family=""Liberation Sans"" />
	<mapping name=""times new roman"" font-family=""Liberation Serif"" />
	<mapping name=""courier new"" font-family=""Liberation Mono"" />

the CSS-font-name and the alias-name handling.
The current implementation is a little bit ""special"" because you can use the font-name in uppercase or mixed case
nd it will be transferred to ""lowercase"" for compare. But the alias-font-names (of the mapping configuration) won't be changed to lowercase for compare.

My suggestion would be to solve this ""dilemma"" is to change the alias names at the HashMap of the font-aliases to lowercase to. (The tests on my side was successful.)

If you confirm that I would create a new PR for it.

Additional on it we have an dependency issue based on the usage of apache-xml-graphics because since version 1.8 the JPGE-transcoder is not longer part of the package. Therefore some svg-transformations (svg-to-image) won't be generated.

### My targets are:
1. Improve the standrad handling of SVG-images to get a common handling of svg-images.
2. Solve the issue with the jpeg-transcoder to switch to the png-transcoder
3. Implements more options to support URL-source-implementations
4. Synchronize the preview availablitity of the designer in the best way with HTML, PDF, DOCX, XLSX and PPTX

**Additiona information to target 1)**
In the first step the svg-images will be handled like the current svg-images which use the transformation into an raster image.
I know this isn't the best way but I will follow the current implementation and in a next step the switch to real svg-images can be done.
(WIth real-svg an separately implementation for each emitter is necessary.)

Regarding the text ""resizing an image ... typically results in a degradation of its appearance"":

I think a better wording would be ""may result"" instead of ""typically results"".
This heavily depends on the output format, the type of the image and the environment where the report is read.
For example, in our application, ""image"" means ""photo"" in ~ 90% of the cases, ""company logo"" in 9% of the cases, and ""icon"" in very rare cases; and the output format is PDF in 98% of the cases.
The photos are stored in a database and it makes no sense to preprocess them to fit to particular pixel dimensions.
So the PDF report contains them with their native dimensions, but with a restricted physical size (preserving aspect ratio).
The reading environment may be a printed report or a PDF file. In the latter case, a viewer may zoom in, so it would be bad practice to store the image with only 72 or 96 dpi at a maximum width/height of eg. 16cm.

However, one reason to resize an image to lower pixel dimensions (before using it in a report) is the crazy pixel dimension that modern cameras and smart phones use (e.g. 30 Megapixels). This only blows up the image files and thus the PDF files.

Regarding ""width and height as a percentage of the original size"":
Even if EXIF metadata contains DPI settings, in reality a digital photo does not have a concept of ""original size"".
You could view it on a smartphone display or print a 10m x 6m advertising poster for showing it in an airport or shopping mall.
And AFAIK newer BIRT releases are not (or no longer) able to extract the ""physical size"" or ""DPI"" settings from the image metadata. BIRT just assumes 72 or 96 DPI (you know better). And then there's the `imageDPI` setting, and `fitToContainer`.

When we use an image as a company logo, things can be very different. Usually the physical size of the rendered image is (more o less) part of the report specification, and you (as a developer) can prepare a PNG (or SVG) file and choose all those properties in such a way that the result matches the expectations.

A particular difficult case is when you use images for DataMatrix- or QR-Codes or classical Barcodes and the report is to be printed on a label printer. Those printers usually have only 203 DPI or 300 DPI. This means that the size of a little bar or square, when printed, should precisely be a multiple of the the phyiscal dot size; otherwise the printer driver tries to ""optimize"" the image, resulting in unreadable codes.

Lastly (as a personal remark), I don't like percentage sizes. I always wonder what they mean:
For example, a percentage size in table/grid column isn't related to anything else, it only makes sense if you have several such columns, and their sum does not need to be 100%.
For an image, a percent size could mean ""related to the available space"" or ""related to the 'original size'"" (which rarely makes sense in my opinion).

I think we should not try to change the existing behavior, as that would break existing reports.
Instead what we should try to do is precisely document the existing image sizing algorithms behavior and how it differs between the emitters.

So each raster image has an original sized and the DPI define only how many point will be used per inch. At the end it has an impact of the pixel count but nevertheless at the end the width & height is given in ""px"".

I know that the usage of percentage to define width and height is (I did'nt use it on my self) not the common way.
So I'm completely with you @hvbtup.
But currently it is unusable because if you use percentage the designer display it in another dimension like the preview and also in another way like the PDF.
So I have test cases where the image looks shrinked on the designer, full in HTML and cutted on PDF - the same report and 3 different handlings.

Therefore from my pint of view the change would correct the current behavior to the correct way.
Because it was planned so to do it in this way but cuurently it isn't working.

That's what I call ""pixel dimensions"".

Yes. I think we both mean the same. We should be careful with the wording.

> ... but nevertheless at the end the width & height is given in ""px"".

I think that's not true for PDF output. There are no ""pixels"" in a PDF. Sizes are measured in units with a physical meaning (that's a bit simplified, because there may be scaling factors, but AFAIK doesn't use them).
As you did work with the code recently and know it better than I do, you may be right in a way, nevertheless.
It may be the case that BIRT does its calculations in pixels (or some other fantasy units) and finally uses a DPI value to calculate physical dimensions (measured in PDF units, I guess) from the pixel (or fantasy unit) dimensions.

> Therefore from my point of view the change would correct the current behavior to the correct way.

I think we'll have to carefully balance if we change the behavior or not (except for the appearance in the designer), because probably a lot of existing reports have worked around the existing behavior in ways we don't know.
So this would be a *breaking change* that requires most existing reports to be tested again and in some cases to be modified.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5lXXz-/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

And at the end, yes the emitters transfer the original PPI dimensions into the DPI dimensions for printing.
On the screen level PPI and DPI is the same but on printing level it is not the same and the PPI will be recalcukated to the DPI for the (print) output.
I have seen it on the image size calculcation of the word emitter which is based on the PPI and will be transfered/scaled.

Your last sentence is good point and therefore I like the discussion before I change it.
My view to define the risk is:
- the usage of the percentage unit is very limited by default because in the most cases the stard units will be used
- the designer visualization is wrong
- the emitter vizualization is wrong on the given percentage values (e.g. height calculation isn't correct)
- dependend on the report implementations images will be cutted instead of displaying

All the points can be fixed with the change and the change implemented for ""percentage"" on element ""image"".
So we will have no impact on the other more common and standard units.

Yes, this change could have an impact on reports which use percentage units and designed around the issues.
At the end I woudl define the risk as a ""minor risk"" and we had an improvement like ""quality of life"".

With the change we are able to explain the behavior without the change we assume why we got what we see.

Hello Ed, the maven-built is currently frozen on the built process of #1406.
It seems to be an issue with the uses Web-Page-URLs and therefore the built stopped directly after the first steps with th error:

I do not know which version of Rhino that Birt 4.13 uses, nor, if we have updated that dependency with Birt 4.14, but generally I would say: Test this in a 4.14 build and see if it works there.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5l_cNM/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Two different workaround are possible (I tested both for similar problems):

Either you can write a little Java class that implements the functionality of the script and call this Java class from the script.

Or you can add VM arguments to your BIRT Java process which allow the classes to be used.

Eg. for a report which creates charts using JFreeChart I had to add

    --add-opens=java.desktop/sun.java2d=ALL-UNNAMED
    --add-opens=java.desktop/sun.awt.image=ALL-UNNAMED

The packages you have to specify can be seen in the error messages. In your case I guess it should read

    --add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.https=ALL-UNNAMED

Maybe this results in a similar error message with different pacakes/classes, so maybe you have to add more `add-opens`.

which means the jar is now located in a different ""module"" and not longer part of the Java-core.

But Rhino doesn't know that he has to search into a ""module"" therefore the jars cannot be loaded.
It would be great if we could update Rhino to this version and then we can test it.
Because there isn't any guaranty that the improvement will work in every case.

I have special reports too which use Web-Requests and currently I plan to create report-jars as external resources to handle this problem. But it would be great if I can avoid this step.
So @merks, it would be realy very good if you could find the time to take a look into it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5mDGoB/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I started today a test session for my we-request report (BIRT 4.12 JDK17)
with the workaround option ""--add-options"" according to @hvbtup suggestion.

The result is that the configuration is working. For the configuration I added the 2 following lines
at the end of the BIRT.in:
```
--add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.https=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.http=ALL-UNNAMED
```

The both lines solved the problems:
```
class:	sun.net.www.protocol.https.HttpsURLConnectionImpl
module:	java.base
export:	sun.net.www.protocol.https
```
and
```
class:	sun.net.www.http.PosterOutputStream
module:	java.base
export:	sun.net.www.http 
```

Perhaps this would be realy an option at first to get your report running.

I see you work with JSON which is good.
In my case I got a xml-response and then I have to add another modules to the configuration
because also many of the xml parser classes and xml classes are separated into new modules.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5mDYdL/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I've created a simple example with 2 charts. The 2nd one is just a copy of the 1st, without any changes: [birt-issue-1428.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/files/12788712/birt-issue-1428.zip)

I've set the imageDPI to 300:
![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/90317691/b632bb37-5e34-4562-8db2-a742d761c114)

When generating the report using the engine the 2nd chart has thinner gridlines (The correct chart is the 1st one. I've set disproportionate gridlines thickness to illustrate the issue):
![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/90317691/452a7805-c4e0-4ba9-b2fc-66ffbaf2d11a)


This issue happens with any output format, but I can't reproduce it from the viewer. It happens only when generating with the engine.

I've tried to debug it and the key is the change in the [Generator's render](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/blob/d72d5fb662e98279b560b4fd90acd4164e400907/chart/org.eclipse.birt.chart.engine/src/org/eclipse/birt/chart/factory/Generator.java#L1022) method. I could see clearly that the 2nd time it is executed (ie for the 2nd chart) the call to [updateDeviceScale method](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/blob/d72d5fb662e98279b560b4fd90acd4164e400907/chart/org.eclipse.birt.chart.engine/src/org/eclipse/birt/chart/factory/Generator.java#L1023C7-L1023C7) is not made because the state has been changed during the 1st call.

The problem is that this behaviour was solving another issue ([#1155](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/pull/1155)), so this has to be taken into consideration.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5n9r_i/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Hello Wim,
I reviewed your change and tried some test with different options to fix the situation.
But I stuck in without a final solution.

The problem is that your change is working on the generator which is instanciated 1times and so your flag is working for the 1st scaling. Which is exactly what you needed for your issue to avoid scaling more and more.

If a report has more charts then the 1st chart will be scalled but no further chart because the flag is set on the generator instance. I tried to register the scaled charts to identify the scaled charts. But each chart is in every call of the according method an own object instance and so I have no repeatable identifier (same chart, but in all cases a new instance).

So I haven't a good idea to combine the common generator-instance and the recognition of the charts to avoid multiple scale.

Do you have an idea to handle it?

We currently do not use any background pictures, only Image tags.

I don’t know where BIRT expects this property.

This what I tried to find out: 

*	Deleted all styles (we use only common styles).
*	Added background pictures to concerned common styles (label, data, text, report, dynamic text).
*	Added background pictures to all tags.

 

I always got the same exception which is not pointing on a certain element.

The element ID would probably be helpful in the message text.

 

Please find enclosed template and sample data.

Betreff: Re: [eclipse-birt/birt] BIRT 4.14 null pointer exception with HTML output concerning background image (Issue #1436)

 

Hello @reiner-killet <https://github.com/reiner-killet> ,
thanks for your noet and also for the StackTrace. At first yes, there are some changes on the background images.
Based on your StackTrace I figured out the situation that the main object ""BackgroundImageInfo"" could be null
and therefore the NullPointerException appears.

Could you please provide an example according to your description because all of my reports with backgroundimages on Tabel, Grid, Row, Cell are running.
I tested different options embedded and URL-reference but I'm not able to get your error.

At which element is the background image located?

is the following change in behavior intended or is it a bug?

A grid or table cell contains a dynamic text.
The HTML is longer than the page.
The `Page Break` properties of the table row is set to `Inside : avoid`.
The `General` properties of he Dynamic Text are set to `Display : Block`.

In BIRT 4.8 the Dynamic Text starts on the current page (if there is no object like an image that prevents that).
In BIRT 4.14 the Dynamic Text starts on the next page.
To let 4.14 start the Dynamic Text on the first page like 4.8 the General properties must be changed to `Display : Inline`.

My text is very long and I shrinked the page height to 120mm to get the effect faster.

But I didn't get your effect. So I think that there is an additonal component or configuration which cause your behavior.

only the PDF emitter shows this behavior.

The DOCX emitter works like in 4.8.

Enclosed please find template and data (w/o pictures).

The XML location should be c:\temp\birt.

The zip file contains a screenshot showing the Dynamic Data which was set to Display = Block for BIRT 4.8.

The zip file also contains a screenshot of the PDF output of BIRT 4.14 showing that the HTML text inserted is broken to page 2.

To achieve same behavior as 4.8 you must set Display = Inline.

 

Is this scenario helpful?

Yes we have there an issue but the reason of the moved first line after page break is not an issue of the page break it is the ""margin-top"".
Because you set in your report 10mm margin-top on grid level and if I change the value then the first line is moved back.
The same effect is given if the ""dynamic text"" is used directly (without grid) and there is an margin-top. SO there is the same effect that the first line is moved.
So it seems for me that the original issue of it is the margin-top calculaton of the PDF-emitter at one of the drawText()-methods.

The reason at all is the thinking of the caluclation.
Because I figured out a part of the source code at LineArea-class which calculate the start position based on the container which is around the text.
But the problem is that with ""page break"" the calculation doesn't recognize the new situation and so there is at the end a kind of height-offset given which moves down the first line. This is very specific because on of the points is that the page-break was caused through the margin-top which is the cause of the break and the (logical) area is splitted so into 2 part 1st page & 2nd page but the margin- shouldn't be repeated again.

### Long text, short suggestion of LineArea:
- 2 new lines to reset the height to 0 if the text is splitted and the height is negativ:

My results looks good. Yes we need some further tests. The risk here is limited at the LineArea and has no effect on other area-container.
If this is working we should reset the AreaFactory to the original if-conditon.

@speckyspooky 
Thomas, I suggest you create a PR (I'm really busy ATM with other things).
Please find attached a patch and two reports I used for testing.

The patch is basically what you suggested, plus:
- I added a comment referencing this issue and bug 562873 beneath your comment in `LineArea.java`.
- Added some text to the method description of `ContainerArea.java` methode `getContentHeight` (as I understand it)
- I removed the if-statement in `AreaFactory.java` completely because I don't see the point of it.
- The seemingly large change in `BlockContainerArea.java` is just result of correcting the indentation.

[issue-1443.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/files/12878422/issue-1443.zip)

It tested the two reports with the PDF, DOCX and HTML emitters, and with the web viewer.

- The results with the PDF emitter look good.
- The DOCX emitter seems to ignore margin-top for dynamic text objects, but I think this is not a new issue and unrelated to this change.
- The Web Viewer does not work correctly for `1443-1.rptdesign`. Again, I *think* this is not a new issue.
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/7644776/8c9b8707-6f81-4784-adc8-b99b01147cbc)

Yesterday, when I looked at the current BIRT target platform I saw that we seem to pull those from the https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/jetty/release/10.0.15 update site now. A corresponding update site for 12.0.x does not seem to exist yet. 

I think that the additional Jetty bundles were:
 org.eclipse.jetty.webapp;bundle-version=""10.0.11"",
 org.eclipse.jetty.plus;bundle-version=""10.0.11"",
 org.eclipse.jetty.osgi.boot;bundle-version=""10.0.11"",
 org.eclipse.jetty.apache-jsp;bundle-version=""10.0.11"",

To support different EE versions: there has been some extensive restructuring of Jetty from 10/11 to 12 (https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/7638) so the corresponding classes are in other bundles. If we can get access to all the Jetty bundles I suspect that the rest will be pretty straightforward.

I've already noted that strangely the first of these three don't exist:

One thing that struck me as odd looking at this yesterday is that of these three, only the latter to exist:

What I'm hoping to do in the next while is create a PR such that you can check that PR out and continue from that point of progress.

Note that the only hand modified part of the *.target is the two versions for org.mortbay.jasper.

You can add things to the target platform simply by adding them to a feature or to a MANIFEST.MF;  even if that is an error at first, when you resolve the target platform using the above steps, those requirements will be taken into account and added to the target platform automatically... 

When you launch a Runtime Workspace just ignore the constraint errors and continue the launch.

My conclusion is that we probably need the osgi-ee8 stuff to get this to work without big changes to how we set up the web application.

Here is a summary, from ""the top of my head""

The OSGI documentation for Jetty 10+ is a bit sparse, but the OSGI documentation for Jetty 9 was pretty good: https://eclipse.dev/jetty/documentation/jetty-9/index.html#framework-jetty-osgi and is still valid to some point. With the OSGI layer in place, Jetty will track OSGI services for Webapps, Contexts, and even Servers and configure and/or attach them to running servers. 
This is what the BIRT Webviewer is doing. First, we create and register a Server, then we create a WebAppContext and register that as well. Jetty-OSGI will pick the WebAppContext and register it with the server., restarting it if required. It will also handle the configuration from the deployment descriptor (web.xml), setting up contexts and filters if needed.
But since the osgi-layer isn't available, nothing of this happens.

Some of the Jetty-osgi layer seem to be available in jetty-core/jetty-osgi . The OSGiServerConstants as well. I will look more into that tomorrow, perhaps all we need is available there.

All this is ofcause possible to do without the Jetty-osgi layer and I have done parts of it before, since the company I am working for uses an embedded Jetty 10 with OSGI, but has moved away from the Jetty-osgi layer. However,  there was a lot of pain to get it to work and we are not even using deployment descriptors.

I merged the latest changes from the BIRT-master to my fork to create a new fix.
When I start the viewer with the current dependencies the viewer which is started from eclipse will be ended in ERROR-500.

Here is the error again, better formatted this time:

```
Error:  Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:target-platform-configuration:2.7.5:target-platform (default-target-platform) on project org.eclipse.birt.chart.ui:
Execution default-target-platform of goal org.eclipse.tycho:target-platform-configuration:2.7.5:target-platform failed:

but was
""/home/runner/.m2/repository/jakarta/annotation/jakarta.annotation-api/2.1.1/jakarta.annotation-api-2.1.1.jar"" -> [Help 1]
```

I think that Tycho is confused by the fact that org.eclipse.e4.core.di has Import-Package headers for packages that are exported from two different bundles that have the same Bundle-SymbolicName (""jakarta-annotation-api"") but with different version numbers(1.3.5, 2.1.1, respectively). That is a guess though.

With that said, un upgrade from Tycho 2.7.5 to 4.0.4 solved that problem, but introduced a new one. Maven complains about a cycle in the graph
```
Edge between 'Vertex{label='org.eclipse.birt:org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.tests:4.14.0-SNAPSHOT'}' and 'Vertex{label='org.eclipse.birt:org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui:4.14.0-SNAPSHOT'}' introduces to cycle in the graph
org.eclipse.birt:org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui:4.14.0-SNAPSHOT -->
org.eclipse.birt:org.eclipse.birt.report.engine:4.14.0-SNAPSHOT -->
org.eclipse.birt:org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.tests:4.14.0-SNAPSHOT -->
org.eclipse.birt:org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui:4.14.0-SNAPSHOT}
```

disabling that test makes the build of the Jetty-12 stuff work.

I changed work laptop on MacBook with M2 chip and install latest 4.13 release.
When opening a template, the program (birt-report-designer all-in-one) freezes for a few seconds.
Template scrolling also occurs with freezes.
The response to a click on an element from the template occurs within a few seconds.
Similar behavior on 4.12 release also.

After install, i edit birt.ini :
`-Xms2048m
-Xmx8192m`
This did not greatly affect the processing speed of the template after opening it.

Previously on Windows I used the version 4.9
I install on Mac version 4.9 for MacOS x86, but after opening template, it was outside the viewing and editing area.

I would also like to inquire about plans to replace the JRE in the distribution with compilation into a native image using GraalVM.

I'm not the expert of the final depencencies but if I can help you please let me know.

I checked the latest changes and I don't know if it has an effect but with PR #1451 the javax.xml.rpc version (seems to be a duplicate was deleted).
I can only see a small difference to the current rpc-version and the deleted version which is the bundle version - deleted version was 1.1.2 and the current orbit version is a 1.1.0.

@claesrosell 
I can see that there was a special .classpath-file on the old (dropped) rcp-version.
Is there a relation to our current classpath issue?

The target in master is using 4.29:

https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/blob/5c22cbe70cc2c78efc654898db61c7f3bd4c1e56/build/org.eclipse.birt.target/org.eclipse.birt.target.target#L344

But that's **just to make the builds work**. 

If you try to install that build into 4.29 2023-09, the IDE doesn't even start.

That is the reason for the prototype PR I created for you.  So on master the setup is like this:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/926d60a5-24b6-4c25-bdbe-a4c27851f853)

If you double click it opens the properties view  and that needs to be 2023-12 for 4.30 in the target platform.

I think it's futile to try to get 4.29 to work.

If you change it and do Perform Setup Tasks, you'll see it used 4.30 and then will update the target platform to that:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/7800d75a-0845-4668-8071-343ca8db543b)

It's been suggested that the missing ee8 bundles are relevant and important, so hopefully that's the case and will be addressed relatively soon.  The work on the ee8 support suggests that a release containing that could be available in about 3 weeks so ideally the Platform will be using such a newer Jetty 12 version.

From my point of view it is very simplified to say ""only"" the web viewer.
I don't know in which way you will test from eclipse designer because all emmitters cause currently the 500-error.
So e.g. on eclipse: if I select PDF and get directly 500-Error, if I select XLSX and get 500-Error.
In this case independent whether the viewer is integrated or not we haven't an option to test & develope the reports.
Therefore I would say, it is not ""only an Viewer"" issue.

Good tho know is the fact that the BIRT-runtime is running!

I have tried a first fixing but this will only avoid the issue of case 1) and your case 2) is the more complex merged-cell case.
The main issue is that the excel-emitter fetch a ""row"" which has no text value finally (condition 1) and the row includes a merged cell (condition 2). In this constellation the merged cell method will be called twice but this cause the error of this issue ticket.

In you case it seems that you have 2 rows which merged across merged cell (in a row 2) A2:K2 and merged cell B2:B3 in differend rows (row 2 & 3) and so you got the conflict because it is not allowed to have such cross cell merge.
In your case the issue is the conflict of cell B2 which is used twice of cell merge which is not possible.

It could be that your ""row 2"" has finally no text and so the internal row calculation goes wrong but there I would need an example of you.

And no, the issue isn't fixed because it is a complex case over all situations.

Woraround:
Try to avoid empty rows by using an unvisible character like ""&nbsp;"" (none-breaking-space) to keep the row.
(In the case above it was an option.)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5qAaIj/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, we use this technique of adding empty rows of fixed height to the report to achieve more controlled presentation and output. Let me check if condition 2 (merged cells) is also in place. The issue occurs with some reports but not with others. The problem is that we have more than 500 reports. Most of them are pixel-perfect/size-perfect page based layout so ""empty rows"" technique is used in a lot of places.

And this cause your exception.

The workaround in your case would be if you use ""dynamic text"" or other kind of dynamic generated text-content then avoid that the result is empty or an empty string.
If you have NULL or an empty string you can add for example a ""Non-Breaking-Space"" (= &nbsp; HTML-entity or key-board-code ALT+160) as result value then the line won't be removed because it is not empty and you got your row with your merged cells.

I found the reason of the conflict and it is the combination of 2 different topics of the Spudsoft-Excel-Generator.
- Reason 1 is the row handling default of excel which removes blank rows by default.
- Reason 2 is the merged cells of excel.
And if a blank row with merge was detected like removeable it will be removed but the merge cells registered already which cause the error at the next line with merged cells.

The quick solution to fix it is to set on report level the user property ""ExcelEmitter.RemoveBlankRows"":
```
ExcelEmitter.RemoveBlankRows => Boolean => false
```
This configuration avoid for excel that blank rows will be removed (default is true).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5qVzzy/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks again for sharing the solution. Appreciate that. Does this property ExcelEmitter.RemoveBlankRows already exist as a standard property or do you have to create it yourself under User Properties->Add? So, the emiiter code is already aware of this ""undocumented"" property and it will behave accordingly? Or do I need a new version of emmitter that honors the property?

I tried adding ExcelEmitter.RemoveBlankRows=false at report level (user properties) but it did not do the trick. Please, see attached report design and the libraries. You won't be able to run it since it requires j2ee/ejb runtime to feed the data but you should be able to see the design. Thanks again!

I have checked your report and it is a complex report so I can only say thet you have used the user property correctly. 
I use the property since BIRT 4.6 and it is a standard property of the Spudsoft-excel. And yes there are some more undocumented properties.

But due to the complex structure and the unclear behavior what your engine does it is not possible to say why the property not work. On my simple demo reports it works very fine.

I will try to create a fix for that. But I don't know at the end whether the result of the xlsx genereation is the required result according you dynamic & complex structure.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5qcteX/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

My understanding is that you are not going to implement the same fix in 4.13, and BIRT 4.14-15 requires a minimum of Java 17 to run. If that's the case, we might want to implement the fix ourselves in version 4.13. Unfortunately, we are kind of 'stuck' on a Java 11 baseline for at least another 6 months due to Oracle WebLogic/JDK limitations and the delay in WebLogic support for JDK 17 and up. At the same time, our clients are very ""noisy"" about this Excel conversion error.

How involving is this fix? Are there a lot of dependencies? Would it be possible/easy to port the code changes you made into the 4.13 Excel emitter?

 I'm using the Spring Boot system with Java JDK 1.8. I've designed a .rptdesign file using BIRT Report Designer 4.12, but when I try to export it to xlsx in Java 1.8, I encounter the error as mentioned in the title.

Thanks for answering. i am using birt designer 4.12.0 and birt runtime 4.4.1 . My prod java project is using jdk 1.8. There are many other libraries following.

That makes me believe that there is a mix of jars from different versions of the Birt distribution in your environment.
The error you have states that two classes from the same package are signed with different certificates, which also makes me believe that there are multiple versions of some jars on your classpath. Either that has been done by someone in your organization or someone else is trying to do something malicious.

Are you running Birt in an OSGI environment?

@claesrosell It seems that mongodb on dependency 4.4.1 is not fully supported like on birt designer 4.12 . There are a few properties that Java says are not supported.

It is important to understand that Birt 4.4.1 is almost 10 years old. It was released when MongoDB v2.6 was the most bleeding edge version. I do not know what version of MongoDB you are using, but v7 was recently released.
SCRAM, which is the default authentication mechanism in MongoDB was introduced in v3, which was released after Birt 4.4.1

There you can configure all jdbc driver based on the driver manager and you can connect to the databse which you plan to use with the latest driver from the database.
Then you are independent in full, you are able to use the latest database driver.

I started directly after the master update the update of my fork and the result is mixed situation.
The good thing is we can start from eclipse-designer now the output-creation like xlsx, pdf, etc.

But the BIRT-viewer is crashed and I'm not sure is it an issue on my side with the project update or is there a topic with the Jetty-migration. What is the result if you start the BIRT-viewer on your eclipse version?

The jetty 10.0.15 bundles are noted as missing on the plugin validation. So the plugins are marked like required but will be missed on my side. Do you mean this can cause the issue.

You will see that Jetty refuses the request to resources which are not direct. This includes symlinks and ""relative"" directories.

The magic here is the .normalize() call, which does not exist on URL, hence the conversion to URI and back. 

What I really would like to do is use an URLResource to the bundleentry as baseResource on the WebAppContext. That used to work in Jetty-10 but does not work any longer. I suspect that line 650 in org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.ContextHandler
```
      if (!Resources.isReadable(baseResource))
```
is wrong. Think that it should be
```

Can be reproduced with the BIRT 4.15 All-in-one distribution. 

1. Unzip BIRT all-in-one to a location which has a space in the path.
2. Create a report project and a new report - even a blank report will do.
3. Use the preview button on the toolbar to, ""View Report as PDF"", ""View Report in Web Viewer"", etc. 
4. You should see errors in the log around not being able to start the application server, the crux of it is that the URL to URI conversion will fail if there's a space in the path:

If using an installation path *without* spaces is a workaround, then I wonder if fixing this is worth the effort.

Those who use spaces in directory names (at least on Windows) are looking for trouble.
This is one thing developers on Windows learn pretty soon.
There's a reason why e.g. the directory is called c:\users and no longer ""C:\documents and settings"".

OTOH, errors like this always smell like a security issue (missing or wrong or double escaping when writing or parsing data).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc55SGCo/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This change ensures that the generated target is correct without manual changes.  Unfortunately once versions are hard-coded, they need to be updated when there are version changes it the repositories from which the target platform is resolved.  But that's accomplished simply by performing the targlets task in the IDE and checking in the generated target.

The idea is that the setup specifies which units should have versions:

Of course you need to pull, and to perform the p2 task to update the IDE to install the newer targlets bundle that does this generation step.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5qoy6R/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I'm not sure about some details, though.

First of all, would it be possible to also create PDF/A-3 (or at least in a later step?)
That would simplify creating ZUGFeRD aka Factur-X invoices (ATM I am Javascript to create an invoice XML file on the fly while generating the PDF report and then use a post processing step to convert the PDF and XML files to a ZUGFeRD file). ZUGFeRD is based on PDF/A-3.

Next, I'm not sure about PDF/A-1a (EDITED: correct is 1a (a for accessible) instead of 1b (b for basic).
Do you really create a tagged PDF or just a dummy tag structure?
Or are the validators just not properly checking this?
You know, PDF/UA also requires a properly tagged PDF.

If the PDF is not properly tagged, it would be better to not allow declaring the PDF to be PDF/A-1b conformant.

Regarding the title and language:
I think defining a language property (which would be like an inheritable CSS property) would be a good idea.
In the easiest case, one would define the language at the report level.

Regarding font handling:
I think when the fallback font actually has to be used, that is an issue with the report design, because the report will not look as intended. There should be an option to treat this as an error and add this to the error list (which allows the caller to detect this problem).

So I'm checked all this details before.

- This change is from my side only the first steps and open this option for further PDF/A-levels.

- openPDF 1.3.30 support: PDF/A-1a & -1b, currently there is no PDF/A-3 support given

- openPDF tagged PDF: this is the standard mechanism of openPDF (real structur, no dummy, no special implementation here)

- The validator checks if the structure is a valid tagged structure. If the structure is not given then it isn't a valid PDF/A.

- Language of ""dc:title"" couln't be set by default with CCS-properties on report level, because there are special values according der PDF-definition. But the main issue is that there is no option given to write the XMP metadata (=XML structure) in the right way. I have done it but the problem is that the **structure includes the PDF-creation date and also the PDF-modification date** and the validation rules means that these values must be equal to the date stamps at the PDF-document (, make sense).
But the datetime stamps cannot be in sync because if I write the XMP metadata I will have another stamps like on the PDF-document because it will be created later and currently there is no simple way to set the datetime stamps directly.
All documented mechanism are based on a physical stored file which can be use to overwrite the properties (post-processing).

- Fallback font: Yes, the responsibility of the fonts is a task which is located on the report-developer. But during the development and also for the migration from existing reports it will help to implements and migrate the reports. This value isn't set by default so you would get an invalid pdf with the standard stacktrace into the PDF-document (based on text level, not like PDF-written text).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5q9Dzf/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I cannot believe this.

AFAIK calling `writer.setTagged()` merely *declares* that the document is tagged, but it doesn't add the tag structure AFAIK actually.
Otherwise we could have PDF/UA ""for free"" (see #1234).

You can use the PAC 2021 (PDF Accessibility Checker) to actually see the tag structure.

The PDF-document will be marked as tagged and the master structure internally will be created (no dummy).
Yes, would be more to do to have all tagged at the end.

But this is not my target.
The target is to get an option on BIRT that we can create PDF/A (1a & 1b) as a standard function.
My target currently is not to create PDF/A-3 and not to create PDF/UA.

The ""a"" stands for accessibility and this requires a complete tag structure (just as in PDF/UA).
https://www.pdfa.org/wp-content/until2016_uploads/2011/08/das_bessere_pdfa-1b.pdf

If we add an option to create (seemingly) PDF/A-1a, people would of course think that BIRT supports PDF/A-1a.
But this isn't the case yet.

This topic is very important for the future of BIRT and thus I think the output should not ""lie"" by stating it's PDF/A-1a conformant when it isn't really.

So, in a first step we should only support PDF/A-1b (""b"" for basic profile).

Adding support for PDF/A-1b (and for PDF/UA, by the way) will be easy once we can create tagged PDF.

But this isn't the same. The PDF/A1a ist different like PDF/UA. all PDF/UA-documents are vailid PDF/A1a documents but not all PDF/A1a documents are valid PDF/UA.

The PDF/UA conformance needs according to your explanations more details and the full tagged structure.
I used your tool and one thing was found that the ""dc:title"" isn't listed. But this is only a requirement to be PDF/UA conform but not to be PDF/A1a conform.

The PDF/UA stanards is a subset of PDF/A1a and PDF/UA is more restrictive instead of PDF/A1a.
So it isn't correct to say that the PDF/A1a isn't valid.

So I checked also a PDF/A1a with the wrong ""dc:title"" definition with the added Title but the unnoted language-attribute.
All 3 validators give an error because the title-definition is wrong. Your PDF/UA-checker means all is fine.

Currently my point of view is that the PDF/A1a version is a valid option.
Yes, it is not PDF/UA conform because for that there are some open point.

But you can test the created PDF/A1a documents from my demo-zip-file and you will finde,
that 3 error types are given of PDF/UA which means ""dc:title"" unset, ""DisplayDocTitle"" is unset, PDF/UA identifier not found and an operation ""cm"" was used which is not allowed. This is coret of PDF/UA but not required on PDF/A1a.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5rBR5W/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I tested your document `pdf_enhancement_version_PDF_A1A_FBfont.pdf` with an evaluation version of a commercial tool from the Swiss PDF Tools AG if it conforms to PDF/A-1a.

This tool says:
```
- PDF: Graphics operator cm is not allowed in text object. (content of page on page 1)
Document conforms to PDF/A-1a: false
```

The validator does not complain about the missing tag structure, although this structure is empty (as can be seen with PAC 2021), so that's ok for me.

The same test result also for PDF/A-1b conformance.
Other validators I used earlier (when I used Apache PDFBox to convert the BIRT PDF to PDF/A-1b) did not say anything about the `cm` operator, so I guess this is a minor issue in reality.

Probably many documents claiming PDF/A1-a (or PDF/A1-b) conformance aren't actually conformant, so while we know that there are issues left (like the `cm` operator and the title), I'm fine with your PR.

I prefer that we add the new option on the release notes and additional on it we should not that the PDF/A* will be genereated with ""openPDF version 1.3.30"". So it is full transparent which library is used to generete the PDF/A.

I agree that we should add the hints PDF/A1b = ok, PDF/A1a with limitation based openPDF.

At the end with my experience in the past and you Henning that PDF/A is complex and one of the main issue is to have a good generator of PDF/A and also to have a good validator.

I tested with ""https://www.pdf-online.com/osa/validate.aspx"" agaian and there is noted the ""cm""-operator and the issue with the ""dc:title"".

So we have know 9 validators of PDF/A1a with 7time=ok, 1times = faild due to ""cm"", 1times failed due to ""cm"" and ""dc:title"" (if it used).

So you have to pay to read them.
Many developers are not willing to or cannot afford to do this (particular in the open source eco system), and so they don't know the exact content of the standards.
Apart from that, writing a validator that validates e.g. the tag structure *is* complicated.
I think that's why different software producing PDF or validating PDF shows different results.

thx for your reply.

sorry,I made a mistake.

The problem is that a long number will not be displayed completely. Just like below:
![1](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/4618927/15253acf-c2d3-446a-ae66-c0685fb4c4b6)

The value is 123456789000, but the report generated displays 123456789.

Because each column of the table has a fixed width, then if the number is longer than the width, the excess part of the number will be obscured.

If long number could display in multiple lines with fixed width columns, the problem is solved.

Maybe I donot use birt in the right way, thx for your guidance.

Long numbers could display in multiple lines, but I should specify the number of character where I put a 'Enter'.

The code is : fun.putEnter(dataSetRow['Value'], 9) .

If I get lots of reports, and each report gets lots of columns(fixed width), then I have to write the 'putEnter' code for every column.

If Birt could display long numbers in multiple lines automaticly, I will save a lot of repeated/trivial codes.

My personal opinion is:

I don't think that there is a strict *technical* reason for not running both handlers.

OTOH there is no need to allow running both handlers: 
If you alread have developed a Java handler for the item, then what's the reason to put part of the logic into a Javascript handler and run both? It seems safer and cleaner to have all the logic inside the Java handler then.

Probably only a very small percentage of BIRT users know about Java handlers at all, and even less are using them.
So, while changing this behavior should be considered a breaking change in theory, hardly anyone would notice at all.

So while I don't see a reason to change the behavior, I don't have any objections against it.

From my POV: Feel free to submit a PR.
But if you are going to change the behavior, please consider performing this change *for all the other events as well*, not only the initialize event of one special item type (because that would be confusing for everyone except you), and describe the new expected behavior in detail.

I cannot generate a report without a lot of stack trace output in the following situation.

I am using the Oracle JDBC driver.

A parent dataset selects a column IADRNR_KUNDE which is defined as NUMBER(10) in the Oracle DB.
This contains an ID of an individual person. In BIRT, the datataype is shown as `decimal`.

A child dataset uses two input parameters: param_FIRM_ID (an ID of a company) and param_IADRNR (an ID of an individual person).
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/7644776/de76f753-94de-4bda-93ee-54053b22875e)

In the layout I have a structure like this:
A list (bound to he parent DS)
Inside the list's detail area, there are two items ""Customer"" and ""Supplier"", which both are bound to the child dataset.
 bound to the child dataset.

The first one uses IADRNR_KUNDE from the parent query:
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/7644776/4f953ba8-3584-49b7-b75f-84b672942271)
(I still use BIRT 4.2.1 for *developing* reports)

The second one uses `null`, because we don't want to output a person here, just the company address:
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/7644776/8015b2bb-3ea6-49c0-b4a1-c1a5085f1a50)

Running this report results in a BIRT error:
```
org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.EngineException: Cannot get the result set metadata.
    org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.JDBCException: SQL statement does not return a ResultSet object.
SQL error #1:ORA-00932: Inkonsistente Datentypen: CHAR erwartet, NUMBER erhalten
 ;
```

Now I now that the valid values for IADRNR are > 0, so I tried to use `0` as a replacement for `null` (the SQL query is written in a way that it will treat the values `null` and `0` for the input parameter in the same way).

So I changed the parameter binding like this:
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/7644776/b208989b-6ead-429b-b31b-80437b09e29b)

![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/7644776/6406fd84-c7c4-4a1c-8521-bb72f0960cad)

With this change, the report works as expected, but there is a lot of stack trace output in the log:
```
Cannot get the type for parameter: 1.
org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.JDBCException: Cannot get parameter type.

```

The next thing I tried was to use `java.math.BigDecimal(0)` instead of a `0` literal:

![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/7644776/ff478b8d-24f1-4674-9c56-388e08a68f7d)

This has the same effect as using 0: The report works, but a lot of log output:

```

```

I think that the whole input parameter handling always was and still is broken.
I mean, we explicitly specify the input parameter datatype in the DS definition (see the first screenshot), so why does ODA think it has to magically find out the parameter type in getParameterMetaData?

This is independent of the source change it was the handling before.
I don't know why.

Question from my side:
Where you see the stack trace?
I ask you because I habe changed my test case but ist must be to simple in compare to your version.

1. I have dataset 01 ""master-parent-loop""
2. I added in this table at detail level an inner table with a ""slave-child-dataset""
3. The child-data-set use the binding-parameter from the master-parent-loop and the key value can be set to ""null"" but I cannot see your stack trace. I can only see the correct report result.

I use the web-viewer for execution and there isn't any error display on my console.

I usually try to avoid using numerical input parameters for JDBC datasets, but in this report it seemed to be the natural solution.
Maybe the same error occurs with an older BIRT release, I'll have to verify this.

I'm pretty sure it is related to the Oracle JDBC driver as well.
A few years ago, I created an Oracle support ticket (""TAR"") regarding the original issue.
We then traced the JDBC calls and Oracle support told me that the sequence of JDBC statements didn't really make sense from their point of view.

Regarding ""where do your see the stack trace?"":
I am using a logging configuration where I redirect JUL to log4j (resp. reload4j). And that's logging to a RollingFileAppender.
I set the level to DEBUG for org.eclipse, org.eclipse.birt and org.eclipse.birt.data, but that's not really necessary, because the trace comes out with ERROR level.

No time ATM to supply further details, I hope I can add more this afternoon.

<sup>Originally posted by **aremund** January  3, 2024</sup>
We generate large xlsx-Files and want to avoid high memory-consumption. Therefore, we make use of the streaming-option `ExcelEmitter.StreamingXlsx` introduced with https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1322 This works great!

Since using this streaming-option, we get temporary files generated in `/tmp/poifiles` We did a bit of research and the Apache POI streaming-extension achieves the reduction of memory by writing those temp-files. In particular, I found the following remark https://poi.apache.org/components/spreadsheet/how-to.html#sxssf
> Note that SXSSF allocates temporary files that you **must** always clean up explicitly, by calling the dispose method.

I looked at the implementation of the option `ExcelEmitter.StreamingXlsx` and did not find any such call. Would it be possible, to add such a call to tidy up the temporary files?
In the meantime, we will just delete those temp-files on a regular basis.</div>","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1533/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I’m working on improving parts of BIRT’s more or less internal code, see
https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/pull/1531 

(This is meant for preparing JS script support for ExtendItems like RotatedText as a next step, but that’s a different topic).
What I did in PR 1531 was to add types to dozens of collections arguments and variables, e.g. List<WhatEver> instead of just List.

I guess the only place this could have a negative impact is when using plugins. 

So I’m asking:

Does anybody on the list develop or use custom plugins (except RotatedText) or know someone who does? 

It would be nice if anyone could test if the code changes from PR 1531 cause any problems for such plugins.

I don’t think this will be a problem, but it would be good to be sure before merging.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Henning von Bargen

I tested the last release of 2024-01-12. PDF is looking pretty good!
But regarding DOCX there is a change in behavior compared to 4.8:
We use grids in header & footer for easier positioning of pictures, page number etc.
In 4.8 the footer fits to the main area. See screenshot `No indentation of header and footer in 4 8 output DOCX.png`.
In 4.14 the footer moves to right. See screenshot `Indentation of header and footer in 4 14 output DOCX.png`.
I examined the footer and found out that BIRT creates a nested grid.
The inner grid results from my template.
The outer grid is added by BIRT.
The difference is that in 4.8 the outer grid hat a negative left indent and the inner grid had a positive indent of same amount.
In 4.14 the outer grid has no indent and the inner grid has a positive indent.
Next, I found a workaround:
The `Simple Master Page` has 2 properties in the `Advanced` slider:
- `Columns` which is set to `1 : inherited` as default.  
- `Column spacing` which is set to `12pt : inherited` as default.
When I change one of these values (`Columns` to `3`, or `Column spacing` to `0pt`) 4.14 behaves like 4.8.
Thereto, see screenshots `Indentation of header and footer in 4 14 - Workaround effect in XML.png` and `Indentation of header and footer in 4 14 - Workaround in designer`.
I do not understand the meaning of `Columns`. Set to `3` BIRT does not create 3 columns. 
Can you please check if this is a bug or maybe a feature somewhere else?
In my opinion it is a bug because a template with only default values should not lead to different indents in header, footer, and main area.
Thanks, Reiner

Regarding MS Word output, keep in mind that MS Word changed its behavior in the past years.
I know that because all of a sudden reports looked differently and the only thinh I changed was the version of MS Word used to open the document. The emitter now declares the output as MS Word 2016, to prevent Word from opening the document in compatibility mode. Your issue might be related to that change.

Short note to this topic, the effect of the indent of the header grid is given since version BIRT 4.10.
I agree with BIRT 4.8 the 2 grids have the same start indent but with 4.10 the header/footer got an additional indent.

The table column hat to be without column width.
Under the above conditions it optimized column width and height. 
In 4.14 the line height is adapted like in 4.8 according to the line breaks in the cells.
But the width is not adequately resized.
The workaround would be: working with static column sizes but actually it a a loss of functionality.
Enclosed please find a report of 4.8:
[Output Price List 4.8.xlsx](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/files/14049252/Output.Price.List.4.8.xlsx)
Here is a report of 4.14:
[Output Price List 4.14.xlsx](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/files/14049258/Output.Price.List.4.14.xlsx)
Here is the data with pictures:
[PsaRptPli.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/files/14049277/PsaRptPli.zip)
And last the template (still in 4.8 mode):
[PSA_RPT_PLI_ENG.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/files/14049308/PSA_RPT_PLI_ENG.zip)
Or is there another method to optimze column width which I did not know?
Thanks, Reiner

There is an ExcelEmitter-property to force the auto-fit but it seems to be a changed behavior into the apache poi library for xlsx and therefore the internal calculation is a little bit optimistic for the real column size.
So I will test some details more if there is a good solution of it.

For my it is a little bit strange the behavior at all because normally the auto-fit should be work only with configured Emitter-property also in the old versions. The default setting is deactivated auto-fit. The source-code wasn't changed there. Therefore I mean it is a little bit strange.

Please be aware I tested lot of cases and there are some at the office library apache poi which is used from BIRT to create XLSX. The library was updated to a newer version with BIRT 4.14 and the library includes self changes of column width colculation. Therefore we won't get the full same results of BIRT 4.8.
Additional on it there is a special XLSX-emitter-property ""ExcelEmitter.ForceAutoColWidths"" (type: boolean).

This is caused in the usage of JarkartaEE at Tomcat 10.x.
But BIRT is currently not migrated to JarkartaEE. The BIRT-viewer contains J2EE componends and this will cause the issues.

Some teams of the community modified BIRT 4.14 to get is runable under Tomcat 10 but this isn't currently supported by default.

it appears the error is that BIRT is making many insecure requests. dozens of examples like the following:

Especially for you have have changed my setup of my locat Tomcat 9.0.76 with an HTTPS-certificate (baes on openSSL).
The result is that I have a local-HTTPS connection and BIRT runs under HTTPS and also the JS-Files wil be loaded with HTTPS-connection.

Therefore I cannot confirm that this is a default error on BIRT side.
The question is why shoudl BIRT start with thinking on your Tomcat - special configuration?

He you get the screens of my execution, Tomcat-log and Tomcat-config for HTTPS.

so birt is receiving http traffic from the reverse proxy, and assumes it should generate http requests.

existing behind a reverse proxy is a common use-case, so there should be some standard way to manage this. ideally there would be a configuration switch in birt that could force it to generate all-https requests. alternatively, as an interim measure, i'm working on a filter for tomcat that either asks the browser to upgrade all requests to https or does it on the fly. other thoughts?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc50MB3o/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, we could try it to do only for the web-server side via configuration. But it sounds strange for me ""to change a software"" to fix a topic on a proxy-server.

The service cannot be initialized on Tomcat.

Important: **the problem is located into the WebViewerExample** (, the OSGi-package of RuntimeEngine works).
There is a problem with the available libraries of ""axis"".

I testet:
- BIRT (OSGi) 4.14, 4.15 Tomcat 9.0.76 + Java 17.0.5, 21.0.2
- BIRT (OSGi) 4.14, 4.15 Tomcat 9.0.85 + Java 17.0.5, 21.0.2 (latest Tomcat version)

All service starts of BIRT ended in fatail error.


I testet in compare the BIRT ""Normal"" version:
- BIRT (Normal) 4.14, 4.15 Tomcat 9.0.76 + Java 17.0.5, 21.0.2
- BIRT (Normal) 4.14, 4.15 Tomcat 9.0.85 + Java 17.0.5, 21.0.2 (latest Tomcat version)

The normal BIRT version (without OSGi) is running perfectly.

Additional hint, I have an older version from 06.2023 of BIRT OSGi 4.14 wich works perfectly.

Could you please check if we can change the built-process to copy the according files to the lib folder according to my manual changes.

So all the juicy parts are here with lots of **/* things to copy arbitrary matching things form other places:

https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/blob/master/build/birt-packages/birt-runtime/build.xml

But from this it's not clear nor obvious from where the things being copied to WebViewerExample\WEB-INF\lib come.

I guess it's specified here:

But I have no idea how I can get the built of the OSGi-Version locally to test it.

Also the copy of the library saaj.jar isn't realy good to use the version folder.
Because if it would changed then we have an issue again. So I woul prever another way or we can also use ""javax.xml.soap_1.3.0.v201105210645"" but this jar isn't given in the plugin-folder.

Why we have the older version ""javax.xml.soap_1.2.0"" instead of ""javax.xml.soap_1.3.0""  in our plugins...(?)

The default versionof Rhino is since 1.7.9 version ""180"" (BIRT use currently version 1.7.10 based on BIRT 4.14).

The plan would be to change the default of the BIRT-Rhino engine to the version ES6/version 200.
This version is available since Rhino version 1.7.7 based on new configuration: Context.VERSION_ES6

I analysed the BIRT-process to create the according JavaScript-engine.
The creation of the engine is encapsulated from the report mechanism.

**Therefore I would change 2 classes and set the new version ES6 as the new default JavaScript-processing version fro BIRT.**
But there would be currently no way to change the version back to another version due to the special encapsulated of the engine (implementation of User-Properties would be very hard with lot of changes).

The 2 class changes are necessary for the JavaScript-engine and for the JavaScript-validator:

### Change 01: Class: JavascriptEngine -> Constructor: JavascriptEngine:
	this.context.setLanguageVersion(Context.VERSION_ES6);
	
### Change 02: Class: ScriptValidator -> Method: validateScript
	compilerEnv.setLanguageVersion(Context.VERSION_ES6);

@wimjongman, @hvbargen, @merks 
Please vote from your side should we go this step - from my side I would prefer to go this way.
The version ES6 is a stable Rhino-mechanism and I see many advantages if we use this as new default.
(I don't know any negative facts if we would use it as the new default.)

Thomas, do you mean that the ES version must be set when BIRT as a whole initializes and thus cannot be changed per report?

I'd prefer (if it is possible) to be able to set this on a per-report basis.

Anyway, if it is only configurable for BIRT as a whole, we should allow a system property (say, `birt.ecmascript.version` to manually select a different version, to allow backward compatibility where necessary.

I'm +1 for deferring it to 4.16.

I think this is logically a change to the ROM (just like the improvement to support diagonal borders, btw), so we should _increase the version number_ in the rptdesign files.

The reason is:
The BIRT releases used for _designing_ the report and for _running_ the report may differ (eg we still usually use BIRT 4.2.1 for developing reports). 
If a report is developed in a BIRT 4.16 environment with ES6 support, it will usually not run in an BIRT 4.15 or older environment.

Increasing the version number means (at least I understand it that way): 
This report design might not work with a BIRT release which only knows lower version numbers.
To make an rptdesign file work with older BIRT releases then means to manually edit the file and decrease the version number and hope for the best.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc51LjJk/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have done the retest from my side.

The problem with the ""New Preivew Prototype"" is solved. Based on the nightly build All-In-One & RCP is fine!

The problem with the ""XML Source""-tab is no longer reproducable on All-In-One.
With the RCP-Version and a new created report directly from the nightly build I get again an empty ""XML Source""-tab

Apparently there is a way to do that which doesn't involve creating a report in a project in the workspace but rather directly in the file system. which then uses a different mechanism to determine the document provider.    In this case a ReportEditorInput is used as the editor's input, rather than IFileEditorInput, and that just isn't handled gracefully at all by the structure editor.  Even if I try to hack in a document provider, the editor is not happy with that implementation (see error log warnings), though at least it shows some text:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/a361771e-3174-4ec1-97cf-a716d42be1aa)

This makes me really suspicious.  So I tried this with the 4.14 release and I see both this problem and the design tab problem happen in the 4.14 release:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/c42d44cb-21f8-41ae-8163-28aaa0dc0790)

So indeed both these problem don't look new and in fact I am rather doubtful that either of these things worked correctly in the recent past, which makes me also wonder whether anyone actually normally cares.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc54NnrP/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In AllInOne (1.) the XML source tab and the new preview prototype work for me.
In RCP (2.) the new preview prototype works for me but the XML source tab is broken. I think it is the already known error (shortened stack trace for reference):

I also ran it. Apologies for the low response but I am tied to a customer project.

I tested the RCP and it is broken in many places. We cannot take that thing seriously. I think we can just drop that from the build. See below for some other weirdness in that product.

The all-in-one works fantastic.

Filesize differs on the above used nightly builds by ~3 MB...

The projects don't need Maven dependencies to be updated.  Don't do that!  There is simply no need to do a Maven build in your workspace,  so avoid that too.  Doing such a build makes a mess of the workspace such that one needs to **do a Project -> Clean...** afterwards to repair the damage.

By looking at the stacktrace, I could only guess that the error is related to an image in the report (from the line containing `localizeImage`). 
But why should there be an `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException` in parsing the URL?

I could not find current source code for the `sun.net.www.ParseUtil` class. I only found an older version, and there it seems like this IllegalArgumentException without detailed information is caused by an invalid `%` escape sequence.

But our file name does not contain any percent symbols, so what happens here?

Note: The report is running on a Czech computer at the customer's site; maybe some at some place an error message with non-ASCII characters is treated as a URL? I cannot debug it there, and I'm not able to reproduce it in the IDE.

I don't think so. The file was searched first in `findResource` (IIRC), but it was not found due to the wrong case in the file name.
This is so far expected behavior. Then BIRT tries to interprete the filename as a URL.
But the file name is containing just ASCII characters, without spaces.

> The IllegalArgumentException will occure if there would be an invalid (URL-)encrypted character included at the URL-path

Yes, that's what I think too from looking at the code of `ParseUtil.decode`.

Before the call to `tidy.parseDom`, there's a call to `tidy.setXHTML(true)`.
XHTML is slightly different from HTML. 
And maybe the parser works more pedantic or differently in that case regarding CDATA/PCDATA and the meaning of the special characters `<` and `>` in `script` elements.

I don't know if HTML or XML parsing code has changed inside BIRT itself (apart from CSS parsing, IIRC), but maybe the newer BIRT releases use newer releases of HTMLTidy and behavior has changed there?

BTW we don't see the generated output file completely, e.g. eveything before the `body` element.
Browsers are often forgiving incorrect input, but is there a good HTML linter which you could use to see if the output fulfils the specification, for exampe if you use a script like this: 

    var elemText = '<div ';

The images won't be displayed longer on the HTML-preview.
The issue is given with BIRT 4.15 ""nightly build"" (and further versions of 4.15 2024).

BIRT 4.14 is correct and also the first BIRT 4.15 of December 2023 are fine.
I don't know which change cause the behavior. The problem is that till BIRT 4.14 the embedded SVG-images was directly embedded into the HTML-editor and the preview works fine.
The current 4.15 versions externalize the svg as file and the sources will be displayed like broken image.

As cross check, the output of PDF & DOCX works correct.

I need your mind because I have 2 ways to solved it but which one is the better way (?)

Option 1) Restore the behavior like BIRT 4.14 with embedded SVG directly into the preview - 2 changes
- changes are very small

Option 2) Change the behavior to get the correct file extension and use the file integration - 1 change
- special case for the file extension creation
- only ""SVG"" necessary because the embedded raster-images can be read directly without file extension

Attached the screen of the 2 changes on my notepad for compare.
My favorit would be ""Option 2)"" but I'm completely free and need a second opinion.

Note that the Eclipse EPP packages for 2024-06 will require Java 21.   Of course the BIRT bundles themselves could continue function also on Java 17, but I've done some preliminary investigation into getting an updated version of Derby into Orbit and that raises the same question about Java 21 requirements.

A major problem with Derby is that the artifacts at maven central:

- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/derby/derby/10.16.1.1/
- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/derby/derby/10.17.1.0/

```
The classpath specifies jars that do not exist nested in the jar and the package exports are insufficient.  Also, the source artifacts are also missing.  (I have no idea why that is even allowed on Maven Central.)

In any case, it's a complete mess. In addition, the project apparently has no interest in fixing this mess even if someone contributes the fix:

So that mess is here to say.

Therefore, I think Orbit needs to consume and rebundle the direct downloads of the project, in order to produce well-formed OSGi artifacts along with their corresponding source artifacts:

- https://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10_16_1_1.cgi
- https://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10_17_1_0.cgi

Note that version 10.17.1.0 claims to fix CVE-2022-46337 and it states ""10.17 does NOT support Java releases prior to Java SE 21"", which I can confirm is a fact because of the version of the .classfiles.

So while Orbit could repackage 10.16.1.1, which supports Java 17, it doesn't seem sensible to repackage an older version with a known CVE.   Of course if we repackage 10.17.1.0, the BIRT core runtime (at least those parts with Derby dependencies) will no longer work on Java 17.  No matter what, we really must move forward from the 10.11.1.1 version sooner rather than later.

So my sense is that the only proper course of action is to move to the latest Derby version which requires Java 21.

We ship Derby because it contains the example ""classic cars"" database. It is not something that we deliver because customers need to use it for their own data. Therefore, the CVE is no problem for us.

You can use a visibility expression if you want to *not* generate the output for the report item at all, e.g. like this:

    !row[""SOME_COLUMN""]

Or you can define a function like this:

    function nvl_mt(s) {
        if (s == null) return """";
        return s;
    }

... and then use something like

    ""Optional text: "" + nvl_mt(row[""SOME_COLUMN""])

as an expression in your dynamic text.
It is absolutely not necessary to modify the report design in place in the `beforeFactory` event.
That was only needed in the forum entry because otherwise one couldn't access the display text property of the report parameter at runtime.
But OTOH, accessing that property seems is only ""nice-to-have"", but not necessary IMHO.

You just want to show the report parameters in a *generic* fashion. Maybe this is no longer possible, though I don't understand how trying to access the report parameters is related to accessing passwords. Or is one of your DB parameters a secret/password?

Probably your report parameter is a list-of-values, where its value is some technical key string (eg. `CN`), and a human-readable display text that differs from it (eg. `China`).
When the parameter is specified, you want to show the display text in the report so that the users can see that the data is filtered.
This seems reasonable.

Unfortunately, I think that the creators of BIRT didn't think of this use-case. Probably the display text property only was intended for the report parameter dialog, not to be used at runtime.

I still don't understand how/why accessing the parameter is related to the exception and where exactly the exception occurs in the beforeFactory event.
Can you please put the `iterator()` call and the `next()` call into individual lines?
And can you please post the whole stack trace _as text_?
And can you post the XML fragment from the rptdesign file where the parameter is defined?

Thinking of it, the report itself (at runtime) only receives the `value`, not the `displayValue`.
Theoretically, several different displayValues may be assigned to the same value, so, in theory, the displayValue cannot be uniquely determined from the value (in practice however, a best-effort solution using the loop technique you are using should suffice).
But maybe this is why the displayValue cannot be accessed at runtime, normally.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc555aep/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This data set needs to connect to a DB and thus it has a password property. To get the selection list for the parameter, the data set has to be executed, which in turn means it needs the connection, which in turn needs the password property.

The pull #575 I mentioned prevents this access, because the author considered this a security risk;
I think because usually a report should not know the DB password or other secrets - these are typically set somewhere else at runtime. A malicious report developer could use scripting to read the password and send it / store it where he/she can later read it.

Perhaps you can up with a pull request which ignores this check when a system property ""birt.scriptsCanAccessScripts"" is defined.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc56QtTw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

With the PR #1974 for BIRT 4.18 the handling will be changed. The RuntimeException will be avoid and is replaced internally that the property will be set to ""null"" but it would fix your issue and every try to get the oda-password would get an empty null-value as result.

Your second issue with the displayText could be caused through the current unsupported feature of select-list mit multi-selection like #1967.
The displayText doesn't get bake the selected value for multi-selection.

I tested it at this moment via designer and changed the URL-parameter of the jetty-server to mode ""run"".
So I have 2 test cases:
- mode ""preview""
- mode ""run""
and with both versions I see the parameter details with the same report and ""displayText"".

It's completely fragile and hence error prone, no one quite understands what they do, and no one notices when things go wrong, except perhaps weeks or months after the fact, because nothing tests the results.

You may recall that I've also complained that I cannot get the ""runtime tests"" working:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/d67cac27-c262-4fe8-ba1a-077ca158cad8)

Though it's not clear if those are just a sniff test or actually do some deeper testing.

In any case, if there are not tests for it, and no one tests it manually, not even before a release, then it will definitely end up being broken sooner or later.

Oh well, enough whining and ranting....

Looking at the source,  I wonder where something might have gone wrong?  Some of the looks like unused noise.  Does anything jump out at you folks that might be wrong?

There is the assertion in the title that derby is missing when in fact it is present:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/6d2bc8c5-11ed-486f-81cf-af8605f654da)

But then probably ""embedded Derby driver"" refer to something else?  Should a jar with that name exist somewhere?

But I still don't understand why you are seeing/using that version.  It suggests your *.target is not the same as my *.target on master.  Or some funky .m2 cache is making a difference.  Note I have committed an m2e launcher to do the build:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/208716/fabb66f5-e9bf-492b-be0e-c38cbe27412e)

I would suggest using that to do the build so that you see what I see.  In there you see there are some properties about the base line so perhaps in your build there is some baseline replacement kicking in result in stuff that look older.  It's also possible to change the user.home value of this launcher so a different .m2 cache is used (because it's always located in the home folder).

The QName problem is annoying and stems from the fact that indeed there are multiple things that export this package, including the JRE itself:

I've been trying to stamp out these older sources, but getting everyone to move forward is a challenge at best, and BIRT is effectively downstream from everyone.  My sense is that Tycho build is using a different classpath than what I see in the IDE, so I will find a way to force it not to use older bundles that are causing this problem.   It looks like forcing the use of the newer `javax.xml.rpc-api;bundle-version=""1.1.4""` does the trick so I will create a PR for that to verify it fixes the build.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc55Xyha/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That build produces a small number of ""Maven Build Problem"" errors.

The IDE uses a Modular Targlet Task like this:

That implementation induces a p2 repository from the git clone source and uses the p2 planner do resolve all the requirements of all the source bundles, features, and products against the available installable units in the listed of repositories.   It uses that solution to populate the target platform in the IDE and uses the TargetDefinitionGenerator annotation to also generate a *.target file that captures that solution as a side effect.

This makes it easier to evolve the target platform as new versions of dependencies become available.

The Orbit project generally finds new versions and makes them available:

https://github.com/eclipse-orbit

There is absolutely no magic in the ide.  It’s just that the oomph setup reproduces exactly the same for you as for me. But which maven version you use with which version of Java and with which parameters for maven I can’t be sure exactly what you use.

Specifiying the language of (parts of) the document is probably described in Microsoft's specification for the DOCX format, and that's basically just a ZIP with several XML files, so you should be able to reverse-engineer this by saving the same document with two different language settings.

But the topic is not as simple as you might think:

First of all, I think that the preview locale is definitely not the correct source for determining the locale.
Instead, the text language must be an attribute of all texts inside the generated report itself.

Sometimes, a report contains texts in more than one language.
For example, our neighbors in Switzerland often use 3 languages in the same report.

So, one metadatum for the languae of the document will not suffice.
Instead, one would need a language attribute for all the texts inside a document, or the option to specify a ""main language"" for the document and an optional ""per-item"" language for text passages written in different languages.

This is for the generated documents (eg. HTML or PDF).

We would also need to specify how that languages are determined from the rptdesign file.
AFAIK we have a ""locale"" property for individual report items (inclduding the report itself). The language is part of the locale specication, so I think this part is clear:
1) Take the language from the report layout item locale, if specified
2) Take the language from the report locale, if specified
3) Take the language from the system property user.language, if that is explicitly specified.

Otherwise, do not assume a language - I think we should not guess.
In particular, many companies in the EU run their servers on Windows servers with US English locale, but their reports should come out in German, French or whatever, so guessing the language from the OS locale settings is error-prone.

I don't know if and how the locale is also part of CSS (or in BIRT speak: the style sheet).

Adding metadata about the language of texts is also a precondition for creating accessible documents, BTW.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc55SjDp/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It all makes sense and is more complicated as it seems to be.
I already thought that it can't be that easy because it would have been done already but I couldn't find information why it wasn't done already.

I wouldn't use the locale of the OS running BIRT as well, but I think using the locale in which the report is generated is a bit better than using nothing or defaulting to en_US. Since the user or report creator already set a locale for the complete report.

Since the perfect solution with a language for each text in the report seems rather complex, using a ""better"" locale for the complete document would be a step in the right direction in my opinion.

In my experience and user environment most documents contain only one language, so this could be an improvement, while not being perfect.

What do you think about this?

The solution to verify if we could set the property for the whole documents sounds good to me.
The special thing is more a technical thing because the implementation of the docx-version is a mixture of a central library and own written source (from the original developers).
Therefore we cannot use the library-api directly and so we need a research to figure out is there a cetral property on document level.
(The latest MS Word versions support the language on document level and on paragraphs & tables.)

The otherone would be that the language value would be set through a user-property as a docx-emitter specific user-property.

I'm strictly -1 on some kind of magic to determine the language if it is not explicitly defined in the rptdesign file.

Yes.

I don't think we need to extend the data model or use a UserProperty. The locale property of items should suffice.

A good starting point for where to look into the code should be the DocxWriter.java file. It's perfectly possible to write xml fragments directly into the output. I did this in our fork to support Word ""Felder"" (probably called ""fields"" in English Word?).

- The language can be added on document and paragraph/table level, so we will be focused on document-level fort the first steps.

@hvbtup here you go:
In the file word/styles.xml I find an entry
`<w:lang w:val=""en-US"" w:eastAsia=""zh-CN"" w:bidi=""ar-SA"" />`
somewhere beneath the `<w:docDefaults>` node:

When I replace ""en-US"" with ""de-DE"", save the styles.xml in the DOCX file with an archiver and open the changed DOCX with word, ""German (Germany)"" is set as language for the document.

So it seems, that BIRT sets en-US for the whole document as default.

@speckyspooky I don't quite get it why you want to use a user-property.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, there is a locale in the report context, that is used to determine which translation is loaded, when you have assigned a localization text key to a label and registered resource files with the translated texts for the text key.
It is also used to define the formats on elements when the locale is set to ""Auto"".

Confirmed, my testing use according to my comment see above the style-element.

I'm with @hvbtup that not in every case the usage of the ""Locale"" is a good one
because we would change the default behavior and you won't have this behavior in every case.

My idea would be to test the following:
**1. I won't change the default behavior and default will be ""en-US""**

2. if it is finished with succes my testing we could have 2 user-properties
2.A) user-property to configure explicit the language code
2.B) user-property to activate the ""Locale"" usage
2.C) if both values are active then the 2.A) will win because it is the explicit definition

3. validation will be implemented, is the language code invalid then fallback again to ""en-US""","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc55lF7q/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So I have boiled it down to a simple report to reproduce my problem in 4.15:
[excel_cell_merge.rptdesign.txt](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/files/14883584/excel_cell_merge.rptdesign.txt)
In the report I already set the mentioned user property ""ExcelEmitter.RemoveBlankRows"" to false.

On creation of this report I get the following error:
```

```

The source of the error is the dynamic text wiht HTML content in the last row of the grid (a text element containing HTML creates the same error):
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/22446825/08f71067-72f7-459f-9611-f67860d3af9d)
FYI: in my productive report the HTML formatted data is read from a data set. The provided example report doesn't do this for simplicity and portability.

When I put this element outside the grid, the XLSX is rendered successfully and looks like this:
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/22446825/079d7410-003e-4798-ad2d-d0ae8a58997b)

By seeing the result of the successful I assume the XLSX emitter runs into the problem, because it tries to create a new column for the bullet points inside the merged grid cell.

When I change the report and split the last row to 3 cells instead of the merged one like this
![grafik](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/assets/22446825/dab57b77-25fe-4f09-8ada-a8112423d941)
the XLSX emitter creates the following output, which looks fine to me:

So, if everything worked well, I would like to see this as result of the rendered report:

I think you are right here.

Probably the cell-merging cannot work with HTML content that creates a grid-like structure, in this case due to the bullet points.

BIRT is not perfect.
Support for HTML and CSS varies depending on the emitter.
In particular, you should not expect full support for LI or UL or TABLE structures.

One possible workaround (depending on the complexity of the HTML) could be to create a scripted data set which parses the text into lines, returning something like INDENT, BULLET, TEXT and then use a table item bound to this scripted data set inside your merged cell to render the line one after the other.

As my tests above show, it makes a difference in which context the dynamic text element is located, so we don't have consistent behaviour.

1. Non-merged cell:
HTML content complete in single cell.

2. Outside the grid:
HTML content is automatically split into individual rows and columns.

3. Inside the merged cell:
It breaks, presumably trying to do the same thing as in 2.

So we have at least 2 different behaviours for the same HTML content...

I cannot be completely sure which would be best for most use cases, but I think I would prefer variant 1. 
If I put an element in a cell in the design, I would expect it to be in a cell in the output, since the whole report design works that way in general, and not by adding more columns and rows ""at random""...","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc55khS0/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So because each behavior has to be implement the ""inherited""-behavior and this is from root to leaf.
Therefore each element has his own implementation.

You ""dynamic text"" is special because you use an ""unsorted list"" and this will be handle in a grid or table like an table in a table cell. Of course there i a special handling of nested tables at cell level, therefore you can see the data on grid. 
As a single element we haven't any problem because it will be generated/handled like a kind of special table, therefore the own rows.

The version with the ""dynamic text"" into a grid with merged cell is the special version of a special version because then you have all. A nested tabled into a merged cell. The handling is complex at this moment and there are more constellation which can get such merge topic.

It needs a while to analyse your case and there is no guaranty that it will handle all cases because at the end this is not possible (for us).

In both cases removing elements takes _O(n)_.
Shouldn't it be a `HashMap` or something like that instead?

If you are profiling anyway, it would also be interesting to see the average element count of the structure.

Maybe the size is more of a problem. Looking at the code, it seems to me that registering/deregistering only takes place in the methods of `DataSourceQuery` class.

Maybe there is some kind of _memory leak_ like forgetting to call `deregister` somehow or delaying the call too long? That would cause the structure to grow and grow, if a big report uses several thousands or millions of queries. (Well, with a classical remote RDBMS, such a report would be a candidate for refactoring anyway, because it'd run forever and slow the DB down)

Because otherwise I cannot understand why a few (or a few dozens) queries which are open at the same time can cause the structure to grow to a significant size _n_.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc564EZC/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If you do  Help -> Perform Setup Tasks... you will update the target platform and see this problem.

The problem is a result of this commit:

https://github.com/eclipse/gef-classic/commit/451bc1fff9a904b7e303c5747d05989b738d1c70

Which is for this issue:

https://github.com/eclipse/gef-classic/issues/418

It happens here:

org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.internal.ui.editors.rulers.EditorGuideEditPart.updateLocationOfFigures(int)

Apparently that should now be a Rectangle, but I have no idea the design intent here in BIRT, i.e., how to convert the position to a rectangle.

@azoitl  @ptziegler

I'm not sure this new exception throwing is okay.  The API being called has no constraint on the constraint:

Probably the x-ed out one is the only bogus one...

@speckyspooky 

Commenting out that line seems to fix the problem; maybe this never did anything and was always just quietly ignore.

I see a call to `getRulerEditPart()` using a [XYLayout](https://github.com/eclipse/gef-classic/blob/master/org.eclipse.draw2d/src/org/eclipse/draw2d/XYLayout.java), even though I would expect a [RulerLayout](https://github.com/eclipse/gef-classic/blob/master/org.eclipse.gef/src/org/eclipse/gef/internal/ui/rulers/RulerLayout.java).

The reason we now thrown an exception when calling `setLayoutConstraint` with an invalid parameter is because it would otherwise only lead to a ClassCastException when calling `layout`.

```
public void layout(IFigure parent) {
	Point offset = getOrigin(parent);
	for (IFigure f : parent.getChildren()) {
		Rectangle bounds = (Rectangle) getConstraint(f);
		if (bounds == null) {
			continue;
		}
		if (bounds.width == -1 || bounds.height == -1) {
			Dimension preferredSize = f.getPreferredSize(bounds.width, bounds.height);
			bounds = bounds.getCopy();
			if (bounds.width == -1) {
				bounds.width = preferredSize.width;
			}
			if (bounds.height == -1) {
				bounds.height = preferredSize.height;
			}
		}
		bounds = bounds.getTranslated(offset);
		f.setBounds(bounds);

Because it overwrites the `layout`, method, everything works at runtime, even when integers are used as constraint. But by doing so, it violates the contract specified in the JavaDoc of `setConstraint`, which is what's leading to the error mentioned above.

I also had a look what we could do to make the live for our users easier. Because I still strongly think that BIRT should not have used `XYLayout` here. One problem I noted is that all the GEF Classic ruler stuff is internal. Which is bad because my initial suggestion would have been to inherit from GEF Classics` RulerLayout`. But at that point I can not grasp the implication of making some of the ruler stuff API.

My impression is that BIRT effectively copy-pasted the RulerLayout class to avoid exactly this problem. Which is why the EditorRulerLayout extends XYLayout, as this also used to be the case for the original class.

That's not something I can reproduce. I also see that there is a noticable difference in the timestamps. Are you certain that those aren't just the warnings created from before your change?

> But I thought with the move to the AbstractConstraintLayout we will fix the warnings too.

This only removes the warnings for the `EditorRulerLayout`. But the same problem seems to also exist for the `FixTableLayout` (or rather the `TableLayout`); You are extending the `XYLayout` (which expects `Rectangles` as constraint), but use instances of type `WorkingData`

I think this warning is accurate and it highlights a problem that can very easily lead to a ClassCastException. Because `TableLayout` doesn't overwrite `calculatePreferredSize()`, one would get a ClassCastException due to the following implementation in XYLayout:

```
public void layout(IFigure parent) {
	Point offset = getOrigin(parent);
	for (IFigure f : parent.getChildren()) {
		Rectangle bounds = (Rectangle) getConstraint(f);
		if (bounds == null) {
			continue;
		}

		if (bounds.width == -1 || bounds.height == -1) {
			Dimension preferredSize = f.getPreferredSize(bounds.width, bounds.height);
			bounds = bounds.getCopy();
			if (bounds.width == -1) {
				bounds.width = preferredSize.width;
			}
			if (bounds.height == -1) {
				bounds.height = preferredSize.height;
			}
		}
		bounds = bounds.getTranslated(offset);
		f.setBounds(bounds);
	}
}
```

Furthermore, this layout is used within the `TableXYLayoutEditPolicy`. Because it extends the XYLayoutEditPolicy, you end up with the same potential ClassCastException in e.g. `getCurrentConstraintFor()`

```
protected Rectangle getCurrentConstraintFor(GraphicalEditPart child) {
	IFigure fig = child.getFigure();
	return (Rectangle) fig.getParent().getLayoutManager().getConstraint(fig);
}
```

My suggestion is repeat the same thing for the `TableLayout` class and have it extend `AbstractConstraintLayout` and for the `TableXYLayoutEditPolicy`, it should extend the `ConstrainedLayoutEditPolicy` instead.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc59V1FU/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

TableLayout already has a method called `calculateMinimumSize()`. My naïve approach would've been to simply rename it to `calculatePreferredSize()`. The method from XYLayout couldn't have been called before, given that it would've caused a CCE, so it shouldn't cause any undesirable side effects.

From what I understand, this edit policy is only used to handle resizing the table cells. It's probably fine to leave them as dummy implementations (similar to most of the other methods).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc59WNaT/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If you want to calculate something, you need a number data type (in your case, `Decimal`).
Then you can apply number formatting for the data item in the layout.

However, the aggregation uses use `double` internally, which may cause additional conversion errors (that is another issue which is discussed in the comments of #1089) 

In fact, when I develop invoice reports or similar reports where correct rounding and number formatting is really important, I do not use BIRT to calculate or format any numbers. Instead, I perform all the calculations and formatting at the SQL level.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc59aFv3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The first thing is that you use at the same time in your report ""number"" and ""string:minus"".
This is a problem if the sum will try to calulcat a number with a string => exception.

The best way would be that you use a aggregation function based on ytpe ""float"" and use the number format.
And you add a second element to display a ""minus"" if needed both ypu can control with the visbibility condition.

But currently you try to much things at the same time.

Additional on it I don't know why you try to use at script level every time to convert the value to a string format.
Because the value will be re-casted internally for the aggregation formula of SUM.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc59emIj/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We've established a rule: if the column value is ""number_format_flg='L'"", the number should be formatted in lakhs like #,##,##,###.00. Otherwise, it should follow the pattern ###,###,###.00. This rule works smoothly for individual rows when the data type is set as string. However, during data aggregation, the formatting isn't applied as expected.

As suggested by you, even after experimenting with setting the data type as numeric without any specific conditions on the column, the aggregate values persist in the ###,###,###.00 million format.

We're on the lookout for a solution where both individual row and aggregate value formatting adhere to the column value. For reference, we've included the RPT design and data Excel files in the provided link. Any further clarification needed is welcome. Your assistance in resolving this issue would be immensely valued.

The first thing is that the ""lakhs"" format isn't correctly supported due to internal number format usage of the original java number format. I have changed it to the better library with PR #1708

The second thing is really that you mixed up the stuff of the total in one aggregation field.
Currently without the PR you can try to create 2 total line one for US- and one for IN-format and control it with the visibility condition.

With the fix you will be able to use a script at the onCreate method to format the values:

Hi Ed, could you please be so kind and test it from your side as a double check on it.
The report will be already displayed if I go to the master-layout. This will be displayed and afterwards go back to the report-layout.

But with the restart of eclipse or if I open the report, I get the error again.

I tested different version of BIRT 4.16 with the following results:

» N202405152028, ERROR with NPE
» N202405131950, ERROR with NPE
» N202405121352, ERROR with NPE
» N202405091756, OK

Could it be that we have a side effect through XYLayout-change #1678 ...?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5-GgDE/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Some of my statements have mor like 1.000 lines of code for MS SQL Server.
Also some of my Oracle-statements are very complex and long.

The master development will be done on MS SQL Studio or the SQL-developer.
But in special cases it would be very helpful to have a search option of query text directly on the SQL-DataSetEditor.

The topic is that the standard ""Find/Replace""-dialog are not available on the source-viewer-editor which is the core component of the SQL-editor.
To get the search option I would prefer to add directly a search option into the wizard with forward-/backward-serach

Good to hear that all views will get the option for the Find/Replace-Mechanism.
I will not implement a new way, it is a small helper to solve the biggest pain to find query text on large statements.

We want to upgrade from BIRT 4.14.0 to BIRT 4.15.0. Now, while testing, we noticed that we cannot generate Excel reports.
The preview of an Excel report no longer works in the Birt Designer either.

This problem occurs when generating the Excel using the streaming-option `ExcelEmitter.StreamingXlsx`. In the documentation for the SXSSFSheet https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xssf/streaming/SXSSFSheet.html#autoSizeColumn-int-boolean- is says the following:

> Special note about SXSSF implementation: You must register the columns you wish to track with the SXSSFSheet using [trackColumnForAutoSizing(int)](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xssf/streaming/SXSSFSheet.html#trackColumnForAutoSizing-int-) or [trackAllColumnsForAutoSizing()](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xssf/streaming/SXSSFSheet.html#trackAllColumnsForAutoSizing--). This is needed because the rows needed to compute the column width may have fallen outside the random access window and been flushed to disk. Tracking columns is required even if all rows are in the random access window.

Since the columns are not registered for tracking first, aforementioned error is thrown when autosizing the columns.

Sadly, tracking comes with a performance penalty.
> Because determining the best-fit width for a cell is expensive, this may affect the performance.

Therefore, I suggest to just stop autosize the columns when having the streaming-option `ExcelEmitter.StreamingXlsx` enabled.

I will make a pull-request for that.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc5-yCoV/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I mean, in some places, it should be local-dependent, but isn't, or in other places, it is local local-dependent, but shouldn't be. Implicit type conversions can add additional issues (mostly in JS, though).

From my POV, errors like this could be avoided if *everywhere* we convert between strings and numbers, e.g. for showing and editing sizes, we would use the locale-independent basic Java functions that are meant for this, e.g. `Float.valueOf(s)` and `toString(f)`. I think such an approach is generally easier.
Then it would be clear that a dot always means the decimal point  and there cannot be a thousands separator; thus ""123.456"" always means one hundred and twenty-three plus a fraction, not 123 thousand.
BIRT is meant for people with a technical background, and the users will understand this.
And if locale dependent conversion is used, are we sure that we use the correct locale everywhere?

The root cause of this may be the fact that the value contains a string which should be parsed as a number and a unit.
IMHO, such a string should _always_ use a decimal point and no thousands separator, because basically it is a CSS value and there is no ""locale"" concept for such values.
Thus the correct value should be `572.25pt`. Can you find out where the value is set and why it uses a comma?

because it seems that you are not talking directly about the report himself.

I understand that you try to set the parametervalue via integrated java-call.
At this situation if I understand correctly you will have 2 parameters and you will set the 2nd to ""null"" if the 1st is a ""Date""-parameter.

So you have to implements to steps:

1. step: evaluate the 1st parameter of your report
- option 1: if you know the report where you need this logic you can implements it based on the report name
- option 2: verification of parameters with ""IParameterAdapter.getParameterDefinitionTask()"" - but I have never used this before

2. step: set the value to your report-parameter
`<your interface implementation>.setParameterValue(""parameterName"", null);
`

My be this will help you a little bit for your next steps.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6CPqwv/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Issue : 

- Unwanted Line and Image Repetition in Birt Report Header  

Details :

- Header contains image in background.
- The issue occurs when the text in the header's location field is too long.
- The background image in the header is repeated instead of the text being adjusted or wrapped appropriately.

Community Assistance Needed:

- Suggestions on how to adjust text and image properties in report headers to prevent repetition and misalignment.

Where is it?
Regarding the image repetition: What are the CSS properties for the background image (you can see them in  the advanced properties)? Note that there is a CSS property that can cause image repetition.
What do you mean with ""text being adjusted or wrapped properly""?
There is no magic. If your text doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. To prevent this, you could eg. use a hilight rule (or an `onCreate` event) to reduce the font size if the text contains more than _N_ line feeds (""\n"").

The handling of the user properties is not simple because you have to know that the properties exists and it must be reserach in our BIRT-project source.

To support a bit mor of user friendly handling I will start to enhance the advanced register with the most common user-properties as configurable properties directly at design file level.

The internal handling will gve the user-properties a higher priority instead of the configuration.
This means is an user property configured then this value will be used and not the design file configuration to avoid issue with older versions.

The first change will only handle a few properties as starting point.
Afterwards with further PRs next options will be available.

And also the configuration of further emitter like ""PDF"" can be added here in future.

Hi guys,
here we have a problem (I doesn't like such kind of problems) and I know that this has to do with the double-byte-characters and the UTF-8 handling.
Therefore I checked my demo eclipse BIRT 4.14 for the UTF-8 encoding at eclipse side and JVM (screen attached) but it looks fine.
Have you directly an idea whether it is a general configuration to solve that?
Currently I hadn't any success and wants to ask you before we have to start a deep dive.

In the history I had the same issue on my platform but there I configured the ""-Dfile.encoding"" to UTF-8 and all was fine afterwards. But in our case it doesn't work and have no good idea.

Strange is that the ""frameset""-call is working correctly with the parameters so they will be correct encoded for the output.

But if it worked correctly with BIRT 4.8 and with 4.14 it doesn't work correctly, with otherwise identical environments (web browser, OS, etc), then it is obviously related to changes between these versions.
Of course there are *lots* of changes in the source code, but maybe the reason isn't even in source.
I suspect:
Either there are changes in the sources regarding URL parsing (and/or writing)
Or a library that BIRT uses for this has changed behavior.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6FceGs/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Unfortunately the VeraPDF validator complains about the generated PDF.

Validation error message:

Specification: ISO 19005-3:2012, Clause: 6.2.11.4.2, Test number: 2
If the FontDescriptor dictionary of an embedded CID font contains a CIDSet stream, then it shall identify all CIDs which are  present in the font program, regardless of whether a CID in the font is  referenced or used by the PDF or not

What I tested:

I used the example PDF `pdf_enhancement_version_PDF_A1A_FBfont.pdf` from [the PDF/A enhancement.](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1486)
I get the same result with a newly created trivial HelloWorld report with a TrueType font.

I used the latest VeraPDF Greenfield _development installer_ **1.27.33** (one can download it from https://docs.verapdf.org/install/).

I manually set PDF flavour PDF/A-3A or PDF/A-3B in the VeraPDF GUI.

I know that BIRT with the PDF/A enhancement does not directly support PDF/A-3, only PDF/A-1.
But I think it is worth adding support for it.
As such, the VeraPDF validation report also shows other errors which are expected.

Please note that earlier versions of VeraPDF may contain a bug which is directly related to this topic, see https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-library/issues/1462. That issue was reported by Tilman Hausherr, the main committer of Apache PDFBox.

Please note that for PDF/A-3, the requirement for fonts is different in comparison to PDF/A-1.
If I understand this correctly, then PDF/A-3 requires that the ""CIDSet"" is either complete or not there at all, whereas for PDF/A-1 an incomplete set is OK.

There recently was a change in OpenPDF (see https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/1041).

I am not quite sure what is to do here.

First question: 
Obviously, we create an imcomplete CIDSet. And AFAIK BIRT uses OpenPDF 1.3.30. However, in the description of the mentioned issue, it is stated that this worked up to 1.3.30.

Much more important: How can we avoid the error?
I reckon that we would need to use a newer release of OpenPDF which includes the changes to allow disabling CIDSet generation, and this flag should be made acessible to BIRT developers as a UserProperty just like the other UserProperties from #1486.

@speckyspooky Probably, if you are going to add support for PDF/A-3 in the PDF emitter, then for PDF/A-3 (opposed to PDF/A-1), you need to call the new API `font.setIncludeCidSet(false);` for each font. The documentation says

    /**
     * Indicates if a CIDSet stream should be included in the document for {@link TrueTypeFontUnicode}.
     * When set to <CODE>true</CODE>, a CIDSet stream will be included in the document.
     * When set to <CODE>false</CODE>, and {@link PdfWriter#getPDFXConformance()} does not require it,
     * no CIDSet stream will be included.
     *
     * @param includeCidSet new value of {@link BaseFont#includeCidSet}
     */

Not sure about PDF/A-2, but I think it should work like PDF/A-3.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6FyCRX/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As such it could greatly improve the ""BI"" in BIRT.
Furthermore, it makes accessing a great variety of data sources a snap and it has excellent SQL support.

So I thought it would be great to create a sample report demonstrating how to use DuckDB to perform advanced SQL queries over Parquet or Arrow files (both are columnar storage formats).

DuckDB also can be used as a stand-alone CLI program (similar to e.g. Oracle SQL*Plus, but more advanced).

DuckDB includes a [JDBC driver](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/java).

I was able to install the driver (straightforward), create a report with a data source and test the data source successfully.

However, when I try to create a JDBC Select data set, this fails with an exception

`Unrecognized configuration property "",metadataBidiFormatStr""`

Note: The error message above is not copy-pasted, it is what I remember from yesterday when I was at home.

What I did:
- Install BIRT 4.16 report designer all-in-one for windows.
- Create a new new report project
- Install the JDBC driver (downloaded from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/duckdb/duckdb_jdbc/1.0.0/duckdb_jdbc-1.0.0.jar )
- Create a new report
- Create a data source, choose the DuckDB JDBC driver and the URL `jdbc:duckdb:`
- Test the data source
- Download a parquet file as described in https://duckdb.org/2021/06/25/querying-parquet.html
- Create a JDBC select dataset with the DuckDB datasource and a query like this 

```
  SELECT count(*)
   FROM 'taxi_2019_04.parquet'
   WHERE pickup_at BETWEEN '2019-04-15' AND '2019-04-20'

```
Here, I replaced the filename with the full path.

As soon as I press OK in the DS editor, BIRT fails with the exception as described.

I don't say this is an error in BIRT. Obviously the DuckDB JDBC driver does not implement some metadata calls which BIRT seems to expect. However, it would be great if we can make this work somehow.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1825/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, I can confirm that there is a topic with the JDBC-driver.
Following your instruction I got the error the first time directly at creation moment of the DataSet
and further at the moment where I tried to store the query.

The last time as I saw the ""metadataBidiFormatStr"" it was very deep into the source.
I will take a look with the debuger and may be we have luck to see details which can help to find a solution of it.

Through this change the support of the DuckDB driver is possible.

The target of this change is to give BIRT a fallback configuration and a small individual configuration to handle which driver(s) should be validated an which driver(s) should be excluden from the validation.

The reason of it is that the change of the JDBC driver manager is a central change and change the standard behavior.
The second reason is that it could be that the JDBC driver information of the supported properties are not full defined
and with this additional change it can be handled.

The following options will be given as *global system environment parameters* of the JVM:
- birt.driver.property.validation.enabled
o true, property validation is enabled (default)
o false, property validation is disabled

- birt.driver.property.validation.excluded.drivers
o unset, all drivers will be checked
o is set, the listed drivers will be excluded from the validation
o value, driver class name, for multiple driver listing a list splitted by comma separated class names can be used

** examples of global JVM parameters:**
- -Dbirt.driver.property.validation.enabled
o the validation is disabled

- -Dbirt.driver.property.validation.excluded.drivers=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
o validation is enabled but without the driver of ""SQLServerDriver""

- -Dbirt.driver.property.validation.excluded.drivers=org.duckdb.DuckDBDriver,com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
o validation is enabled but without the both drivers of ""DuckDb"" & ""SQLServerDriver""

I have uploaded a sample report. The report works when exporting to DOCX and XLSX. This does not work for PDF. I used the relative path.  Setting the relative path in the Report Designer is difficult, application seems to bomb out so I just set it in the XML. 
[TestChartImageSeries.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16578888/TestChartImageSeries.zip)

Some background information that leads to some feature suggestions. I generate BIRT reports purely from command line. We do our other analytics using other BI applications but BIRT has proven to be the best at creating PDFs, DOCX and XLSX. I found it simpler to create different client colour schemes by just simply copying different PNG files to one folder in a batch file then generating the reports. I tend to find that adding scripts to BIRT reports makes them hard to maintain for none technical users and even for me. A year later I am not sure where the magic is happening. This wouldn't be necessary if one could enter a dynamic value (with hex value of colour) in the option window below:

- Perhaps bind the colour to a data set field
- Bind to a parameter (probably the most convenient)
- Bind to a variable 
- Or have the conditional formatting interface available here for the colour.

There is an additional option instead of the image option for the palett-color which is a good solution
you would be able to use scripting of the color. The screen below shows the original chart color ""orange"" which will be changed via script to ""red"".
The scripts are included on the chart at method ""onRender()"" - my (small) example is attached.
So you would be able to use a parameter to set the necessary colors (, my example is without parameters but you get the scripts for the color setting).

**This is the way to use parameters for the coloring - one of your requirements.**

Here is the simplified scenario;

About db table;
Table has timeseries data with ts column (int8) and timestamp value saved with epoch format (including ms)
create table tsdata(ts int8,val varchar);

Dataset's query:
with statically typed criteria: select t.ts,t.val from tsdata t where t.ts>1722782152000 and t.ts<=1723559752000 --> results appear about 5 sec
with dataset decimal/float type parameter : select t.ts,t.val from tsdata t where t.ts>? and t.ts<=? --> results appears or hangs in >10min

Possible cause:
type mapping issue between birt,jdbc and postgresql

Work around:
After 2 days of work including query tunings, PostgreSQL memory tunings and JAVA_OPTS settings, I found the possible cause is related with implicit type mapping or conversations. And I fix it such a way below.

1-User cast PostgreSQL function;
select t.ts,t.val from tsdata t where t.ts>cast(? as int8) and t.ts<=cast(? as int8)
2- And I adjust dataset parameter with string type

results appears in ~5 sec :)

But by default of course it is not a typical BIRT issue or a BIRT enhancement because the handling will be done based on the JDC-prepared statement and your used  JDBC driver.

The only thing what you can do for example to qualify your parameter at the dataset as ""Integer""
(in the most cases it will be set to String insetad of the mentioned data type).
Then the parameter will be set as prepared-parameter with datatype ""Integer"" to the prepared-statement.

But here starts the Java-JDBC-level. I don't know if the JDBC driver will handle ""Integer"" according to your used type ""int8"".

From a user's perspective, you are certainly right, but as Thomas wrote:

> The changed to support ""long"" / ""bigint"" would be no small change

So don't expect this enhancement to actually happen unless you can provide a PR to implement this (including tests).

What I do to perform type conversion in BIRT queries is to use this pattern:

```
-- This is Oracle syntax, but you can easily adapt this for other SQL dialects
with params as
(
  select :p1 as foo,
         cast(:p2 as whatever_type) as bar,
         to_date(:p3, 'DD.MM.YYYY') as some_date
  from dual
)
select ...
from params
join x on (x.foo = params.foo)
...
``` 

I mean, I use each bind variable exactly once, and when I need to convert the type, I also have to perform the conversion only once.

I'm not an expert on PostgreSQL, but I guess what happens is:

The DB sees a conversion between an `int8` column and a `numeric` bind variable.
Now, implicit type coercion says that the `numeric` type is ""broader"" than `int8` and thus the `int8` side has to be converted to `numeric`. Unfortunately, this is the side with millions of values. These have to be converted for all rows, and (that's a wild guess:) maybe not even an index on that column can be used for the query due to the (conversion) function call.

So, since an enhancement to BIRT seems unlikely, your solution with the explicit cast or the very similar approach I mentioned, is probably the best way to go.

As an alternative, you could also modify the SQL itself in the `beforeOpen` event to write the values literally into the statement. But you have to be careful then, because that might open the door for SQL injection attacks. OTOH this way the query optimizer can see whether you only need the data for yesterday, or for the last 10 years, which makes a huge difference for the optimal execution plan, if there is an index for the column (full table scan or access by index).

Postgresql does allow parameter definitions only in functions. 

For PostgreSql, the solution in my first post is working. 

I wish i see this enhancement for the future roadmap.

If you start a change for that please think that the new data type ""Long"" should be available not only on parameter side and on JDBC-parameter-side.
Because there are many other objects which use the available/supported data types like integer, decimal and so on.

So different topics should be adjusted of it like:
- scalar parameters
- cascading parameter
- JDBC-parameters
- dataset result column data types
- data-element data tyes (based elements of tables)

The problem is that the designer doesn't call the spudsoft emitter correctly to create the excel (XLS & XLSX) output.

I had a very, very small report only with a grid and an image/label but I got only the hint on brower level that the browser tries to connect the internal web server but it seems to be that the service couldn't be started.
The final result is that I didn't get any excel output. There is no log output or something else with a hint of the topic/problem.

**But** the confusing moment is that BIRT-4.17-OSGi-N202408111146 works fine and my local dev-version works fine too.
(I updated my local dev-installation will the latest updates and cleaned up the project to exclude external dependencies.)

@wimjongman & @merks:
Could you please to a cross check from your side. May be it is only o local topic on my side.

I tested the following situations:

1. all-in-one-designer
1.1 all-in-one-designer, create the excel directly: **excel = error**
1.2 all-in-one-designer, start preview and afterwards create the excel: **preview = ok, excel = error**

2. OSGi runtime, 
- create the demo at viewer level and afterwards create the excel: **preview = ok, excel = ok**

3. Local environment
3.1 all-in-one-designer, create the excel directly: excel = ok
3.2 all-in-one-designer, start preview and afterwards create the excel: **preview = ok, excel = ok**

If the org.apache.logging.log4j.util.Activator is started,  it lock `ProviderUtil.STARTUP_LOCK` and then later it unlocks it **if and only if** there is a provider.

I'm still concerned whether I'm seeing the same problem as @speckyspooky or a different problem.

1. Implementation of an option to **disable** the hyperlink text decoration as a standard layout option or keep it as it is.
2. Output types: HTML (preview), PDF, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT shall be changed
3. The option can be set on script level
4. The link-click-event-handling won't be changed, only the styling will be optimized.

**Out of scope of the change:**
- The change will not implements the different text-decoration options which are available for web-pages.

I started a research and figured out that the handling of the hyperlink styling is different for all output formats.
Therefore the implementation will be done indivdually.

<sup>Originally posted by **PenghaiZhang** July 23, 2024</sup>
Hi everyone, I have report template created probably 10+ years ago. When my app integrated with BIRT 3.7.2, we could use this template to generate report in both different formats (e.g. HTML, PDF & DOC). Recently, we have upgrade BIRT to 4.16.0,  and then we found that the report in DOC format does not show contents properly. 

Basically, words in a `text` tag are shrunken to super narrow and become invisible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de357b3a-18cc-40e1-809c-9b962c20aaa7)


You can see from the above screenshot where the top line and bottom line are broken.

Looking further to the table configuration, I saw the width is only 0.04cm.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e414cc0-c013-4430-91dc-cbe57f6ae6d7)


We found that if we change the content type from HTML to auto or plain, the width will become normal again. However, we do want to support some HTML tags in our reports.

We also found that if we keep the content type as HTML but remove the text alignment, the content will be OK as well.

Can someone give me some ideas about this issue ?? </div>

Everything is fine in the old Designer IDE. Only in the new one does the problem occur

When ich create a new report , the problem doesnt occur.

what the font-size result will be given in compare of HTML -> (PDF ->) DOCX.

The styling from HTML to PDF is ok but a special situation with the font-size ""12pt"" cause a wrong style conversion in DOCX-documents.

The problem is that the HTML-content of the BIRT-elements ""text"", ""dynamic text"", ""data"" will not parsed into full supported DOCX-elements. Instead of a full parser the archive-/intermediate-format MHT(ML) will be used. These files embedded like external documents into the DOCX and will be converted through Word into the DOCX-elements.

**example of the internal DOCX-structure with MHT-files created by BIRT**
![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a7820fc-5330-46a4-94ce-a2f3d5f15690)


And there exists a kind of standard error on MS Word side because the font size ""12pt"" will be converted in every case into ""10pt"".
This topic is given at the HTML-tags ""div"" & ""span"" but also the HTML4.0-element font is not converted correctly for result size ""12pt"".
(BIRT produce the DOCX-Version: WordProcessingML, Version 2016)

I tried to replace the ""div""-tag with the ""p""-tag (paragraph). But the converting of Word is not the same for these both elements
so we would get side effects of styling. In special cases the styling of a p-tag will override the style of following elements.

Normally the best way would be to implements a DOCX-parser to avoid MHT-files but for that large efforts are needed to get it.
(Note: DOC-files from BIRT 4.6 was created correctly, for that file format a kind of HTML-parser is implemented but cannot used for DOCX.)

The smallest workaround is to use another font-size instead of ""12pt"" to get a better result.
So I will provide a PR that the font-size will be changed from ""12pt"" to ""12.5pt"".
I know this isn't the same font-size and therefore I call it workaround. But it is better like the currenty situation.

Note: The behavior of #1868 was not reproducable on my side.

But the main topic is I didn't know which BIRT verion is integrated in maximo7.6.1.3 and your supplier could added some special features which change the behavior of the birt report.

So in best case you can provide a small example report without external sources to reproduce it may be based on the internal BIRT-cars-model would be the best data case.

Back to my test:

I added according to your side 1 Grind with 2 Columns and 1 Row on each cell I added the same table with the same data.
My table has 46 records. I got a similiar result but not the same result on my side. 
The difference is I have then all data without loose of data.
The same problem was that the page break of the internal tables cause a wrong page breake result.
Expected were 4 pages but I got 5.

The problem on my side was the configured page break on the data table (default: 40 rows then break).
I changed the value to a very high value and then all was fine.

Attached you will finde my example. May be you can test it on your side.

Hi Ed, today I synchronised my fork with the small PRs from milestone 4.18 and Tycho 4.0.9.
After the rebuild I have 51 errors on my project based on a problem ""org.mozilla.rhino_1.17.15.jar"".
By default it is comming from orbit so I'm confused abot the errors.

I tried the following steps to solve the problem (currently without success):

1. Perform Setup Task
2. Restart eclipse
3. Project, Clean up 
4. Restart eclipse

O had this issue in the past and these steps had success but not this time. Have you an idea for that why the rhino-library should'n be loaded correctly...?

And it is very easy this answer. The element which is used for the page numbering is a standard PPT-text-element. The number is not the auo-page-counter-element.

So you won't get any changed page numbers. This is a change request because the element cannot changed by default.
There must be done at first the research of the PresentationML (of Office) and afterwards the page number handling for the emitter is to change.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6N0lkK/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

At first this topic is not an BIRT issue this topic is based on the PowerPoint-behavior.

I figured out that the standard form at your report ""1 of 30 pages"" won't be supported by Microsoft-PowerPoint.
[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-the-slide-number-and-total-number-of-slides-on-every-slide-e62b363a-a5c4-413e-b7b7-52c1a4d9dd02#:~:text=On%20the%20Insert%20tab%2C%20in,Text%20group%2C%20click%20Slide%20Number](url)

There is no dynamic handling of the total page, so in every case you have to change the total page number manually.

Solution for BIRT and page number. If you use the pageNumber-template then you will get an auto-page-count also at powerpoint side and the number will be changed if you remove slides.

Example of the created page numbering:
[test_case_slide_page_number.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17173812/test_case_slide_page_number.zip)

So may be you can change your page-footer-design into this way.
The good thing would be the slides are counted corretcly and only the total page number must be changed.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6N5KQr/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the page count ""3 of 4"" is correct. I have written in my post that the number of the currenct page in my case ""3"" will be set if the autoText was used at the report. But the totalPage ""4"" cannot be set automatically because you have to change the total page count manually.
You have to set ""3 of 3"", but with the autoText of BIRT you can avoid that you have to renumber all page numbers.
But for the totalNumber it is a manual step.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1921,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1921,birt,2547672263,1921,BIRT Version >= 4.8 DOCX Export: NullPointerException Caused by Overflow Hidden Enhancement,kamlesh302,182751583,,,CLOSED,2024-09-25T11:02:24Z,2024-10-05T13:45:42Z,"Hi Team,

I am exporting a DOCX file using BIRT version **4.8**. The DOCX generation utilizes the **AbstractWordXmlWriter.java** class. During this process, an issue arises due to the enhancement of the overflow hidden property on a table cell in DOCX (**see enhancement #369**). This leads to a **NullPointerException** because the method attempts to get the length of a text field, which may potentially be **NULL**.

When exporting a DOCX file using BIRT version **4.6**, it works fine because that enhancement is not present. In that version, it directly calls the **AbstractWordXmlWriter.java > writeString(txt, style)** method, which handles null values properly.

The enhancement code in **cropOverflowString()** was added before the **writeString(txt, style)** method (which is also called from **writeTextInRun()**). This enhancement methods does not include a **NULL** check for the text field.

**Explanation of How NULL Can Occur:** 
In the **AbstractWordXmlWriter.java** class, the **writeText()** method handles a txt field that can be NULL. If txt is NULL, it calls the **writeContent()** method in **DocWriter.java**, passing the **NULL** value as a parameter. This, in turn, calls the **writeTextInRun()** method in A**bstractWordXmlWriter.java**, which also takes the txt parameter.

Inside this method, if the overflow hidden property is set, it calls **cropOverflowString()**, passing txt as the text parameter. In the **cropOverflowString()** method, there is a line that initializes a **StringBuilder**:
**`StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(text.length() + 1);`**
Here, **text.length()** is called when txt is **NULL**, resulting in a **NullPointerException**.

**The latest version of BIRT also contains the same code.**

**Please find the stacktrace below:**

It is an additional option and the existing connection will not removed.
This avoid by standard problems if the connection profile is not available then the local connection of the report can be used.
You have to remove the connection manually or to enter dummy values.

In some of our production plattforms we have up to 5 system stages (development, test, prelife, producton, sandbox).
And ih you have such constellation then every stage have an own connection profile and the report connection supports only the development-stage.

When you enable a connection profile, you lose the ability to modify the local connection of the report. If the intention behind the local connection is to serve as a fallback in case no connection profile is available, it should remain editable.

Now, consider this: if you're storing your report design in a GitHub repository (and it's well known that storing sensitive information there is unsafe), then the local connection details of the report could pose a security risk. This information could unintentionally fall into the wrong hands. Not even the local connection of the report for the development should end up there, you can just use a connection profile for all cases.

From a security perspective, connection details should never be saved directly within the report design.

One more thing. If you edit the connection profile directly in the xml file and reload the design, the details in the BIRT JDBC Data Source window will be the ones from the connection profile xml, thus hiding the actual local connection details of the report design. And it will save that data in the the report design file, overwriting the initial details that we presumed to be a fallback. This sure it's not intended behavior.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6O0XA5/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is not quite the same as using a connection profile, but just to demonstrate other ideas of setting up the connection properties dynamically and avoid storing sensitive information in the report, this is what we do (for our JDBC connection):

The report uses the builting sample DB for the data source properties.

We use a little bit of scripting (Javascript expresisons) in the connection properties. The scripts read the actual connection properties from the environment.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6O_3U1/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So you created an external XML-file with the configuration details.
You have hand written the reading of the config-xml and the XML-parsing.
As last step you set the config-properies and try to start the connection which crash.

But the problem is in my point of view not BIRT by default. The question is which data will arrive the beforeOpen.
And will be set the correct values to the connection.
The message of `&quot;MY_SECRET_USER&quot;` is a default error message from birt this is right but means not that the value has really quotes on it.

Your error dump means that there is an error on the getConnection based on the JDBC-driver and the error means the cause of it could be the user name ""MY_SECRET_USER"", but it could be another value which causes trouble because it seems that you have multiple problems according to the message.

And here only like an example, I have done today some testing and my NPE got the same message with quotes to,
only as a string for compare the message has nothing to do with your case:

The Birt Engine from the osgi-zip is located in our webapp-war under WEB-INF/birt/reportEngine (folders plugins and configuration from the osgi-zip) and birt engine is configurated and started via the suggested setup accoring to the bit-documentation (see here: https://eclipse-birt.github.io/birt-website/docs/integrating/reapi).

Also: I'm not sure if this means anything, but I notice that there are considerably fewer files in the OSGI zip (in ReportEngine/platform/plugins) as of version 4.17.0 (before version 4.17.0 there were about 250 files, as of version 4.17.0 only about 150 files).

If I understand correctly, the old version supported margin, but didn not support padding, and with your change, it supports padding, but not fully. It treats padding the same as margin, but the HTML box has distinct values for border, margin and padding for a reason. For example, to where background color extends.

Maybe it would be better to just document that the DOCX emitter doesn't support padding for labels (and plain text dynamic text items?).

This is the reason why the special padding-grid will be created to simulate the padding mechanism.
The support of padding values is a good feature but there are different implementation ways.

My target is here to provide the padding based on the indent-mechanism for ms word of the ""label""-element.
The main target in future would be to have an option to change the padding calculation in generally to avoid the usage of the padding-tables but to remain the indent-calculation based on the values of margin-& padding.

The topic in generally is that the charts will be created as SVG and so the style properties can be different from standard html-CSS-properties, e.g. text has no style-property ""color"" it is ""fill"".

But the main topic is your reference information are comming from opentext-dev-team and they have there own integrated BIT version which is not the standard BIRT version.

Therfore you can use the style properties only with the opentext-BIRT-version.
If you use the open source version then you can see at the CSS-preference-side which style-classes are supported.

The alternative for our BIRT is to yous the chart-methods to change the coloring instead of CSS.
Here is a very small example of a color change of the chart-axis-title.

I examined this in more detail.

In the resulting PDF, the tab character is contained as text in the content stream, using the ""Times-Roman"" font.
This font is one of the ""builtin"" PDF fonts, not a TrueType font. Thus it is not embedded (or subsetted) into the PDF.
This means, the glyph metrics and shapes are not contained in the PDF.

But PDF/A requires that all fonts must be embedded/subsetted.

What happens internally is:

There is a class `FontSplitter` in BIRT which is called from `ChunkGenerator.getNext()`, which in turn is called from `TextCompositor`.

It's task seems to be to ensure that every character of the text can be displayed; so it uses rules to select a font for each character (most font files only support a small subset of the Unicode characters).

In case of the TAB character, the method `FontHandler.selectFont(c)` returns ""Times-Roman"".
This happens when the preferred font (in my case, ""Arial"") does not support the character (method `charExists(c)` return null).
By the way, `charExists `for TrueType fonts looks for the glyph metrics, whereas `charExists` for Type1 fonts works very different.

The BIRT logic thinks that ""Times-Roman"" supports the TAB character, and thus, this font is selected.

Other control characters in the Unicode Code Point range 0-31 will proably cause issues, too.

In an ideal world, text in data items would not contain any TAB characters.

I am not sure how the different control characters *should* be handled by the different emitters.

Furthermore, I am not aware of an obvious workaround/solution without changing BIRT Source code.

I looked at some TrueType fonts (including some fonts for Code 39 and Code 128 barcodes, consola.ttf, arial.ttf, arialuni.ttf. None of them supports the TAB character.

The reason is obvious: A TAB character cannot have a glyph width, because its width is dynamic by definition.

The VeraPDF validator shows this as a warning:

**Special graphics state operator (cm) inside Text object**

The [PDF 1.0 specification](says: https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/pdfstandards/pdfreference1.0.pdf) says on page 93:

In other words: The `q`, `Q` and `cm` operators must not be included within text objects.

This is what VeraPDF complains about, but (IIRC) this error is so common that until now, it is only considered a warning.

After updating to a BIRT version somewhere betwen 4.14 and 4.15 (to be more precise: https://github.com/triestram-partner/birt/tree/Reporting-2.2.3-20240206), the report changed behavior, resulting in wrong results because I add numbers in a scripted dataset `onFetch` event.

I added log statements to the beforeOpen, afterOpen, open and fetch events.

Old behavior:
open
fetch indx=0
fetch indx=1
open
open

New behavior:
open
fetch indx=0
open
fetch indx=0

open
fetch indx=0

You see that the `fetch` event is called more often than with the old version.

So this behavior seems unspecified and undocumented until now.

In my case it was quite easy to fix the report's behavior once I say the different event sequence.
I just needed to take note if I already processed a record (adding numbers to sums) or not, to avoid processing it twice.

From user side the BIRT-docx isn't like a standrad word-document and it is not easy to change the word-documents based on the created huge count of grids and empty lines (paragraphs).

**The main topics are:**
- The emitter creates for each HTML-text-element a wrapped grid.
- Multiple specialized empty paragraphs will be used.
- Based on this systematic of used wmpl-grids the additional empty paragraphs are necessary to avoid exceptions if docx-document will be opend.
- The the header and the container area get a grid by default
- The list element get for (BIRT-)styling reason a grid (which is fine) but with additional empty paragraph

**Discussions were done before:**

#1352 DOCX with additional lines add header and footer

#1879 DOCX grid arround all HTML-wrapped text paragraphs

**Reserach result:**
- HTML-text grid-wrapped: The main reason is that the grid will be used for margin-padding implementation. And further investigations (debugging) shows that the main cause of the usage is the usage of the MHT-file for HTML-text and the wrong usage of supported HTML-style-attributes for MHT-HTML which can be converted/understand by Word.
When the correct attributes will be used the margin is given like on my implementation of the Label-element.

- Header-Footer-grind: Is not longer necessary because it has no specific effect (comfirmation of #1352). Different style tests had no negative effect if the container wasn't added. The positiv effect was the structure is easier and the empty paragraph won't be added.

- List-element need the additional grid to implements the border effect. So it won't be changed but the empty paragraph isn't necessary.

**Upcoming changes:**
1. Improve the MHT-file handling to activate the standard margin
2. Allow the combination of margin & padding handling (point 1) to simulate the current handling
3. Avoid the additional grid and paragraph on header & footer
4. Avoid the empty paragraph of the list grid cell
5. Add new standard option for WordEmitter-user properties
6. All options can be controlled by user properties to change back the behavior because the docx-structure will be changed

**Planned timeline:**
I will implements these changes and will create a PR for BIRT 4.18","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/1957/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Is a specific output format involved or a problem in generally?

May be you can redo your testing. I used your BIRT-version, extracted the zip file and copied folder ""WebViewerExample"" to the tomcat-webapps folder and renamed the folder to ""birt_4.17"". I started the tomcat and checked the results with the manager view and all was fine on my side.

Thank you for reply,
it is like working on my computer :), I don't know what is wrong but it doesn't work in my computer, can you tell me step by step how you deployed it, if possible? what java version (link if possible) you used?

This change has also an impact for other specialized external PlugIns for BIRT which use the parameter task to get information from the parameters. Such special PlugIns will be detected also as scripted processing.

Our security-scan recently reported a security vulnerability in the rhino library, namely **sonatype-2018-0590** with the following explanation:

<img width=""354"" alt=""2024-11-26 10_29_56-IQ Server - Component Details – Mozilla Firefox"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c047e81f-885f-4383-9918-0d525a6e0179"">

This library is included in the Birt Engine (v4.14.0). 

I can confirm that the Birt Engine processes XMLs extended by XXE accordingly and that the vulnerability can therefore be exploited.

An example for a manipulated XML with XXE-attack:

<img width=""156"" alt=""2024-11-26 10_41_02-New Issue · eclipse-birt_birt – Mozilla Firefox"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dbd9e15-f81b-4024-85fd-40982f79d936"">

The result of the exploited vulnerability in this case is that the contents of the /etc/passwd - file are printed in the pdf.

Although the rhino library has been updated in Birt version 4.17, the vulnerability can still be exploited. I suspect that the processing of XMLs in the Birt Engine as a datasource is not implemented with rhino.

Is this known and can the processing of XML with external XML entities be prevented?

BIRT uses Rhino. Rhino is a Javascript implementation written in Java, and you can use all Java libraries from within Javascript.
The BIRT reports can contain Javascript which is executed when the report runs.

So you could just as well read /etc/passwd with a little Javascript *without* using this XML weakness.

When you use BIRT, it ist essential that you don't run reports (or libraries called from reports) from untrusted sources, because a BIRT report can do everything that the process running BIRT can do.

That said, BIRT does not use Rhino to read the *.rptdesign / * .rptlibray files, and AFAIK BIRT does not use Rhino to process XML datasources. Instead, BIRT uses Java libraries for reading and writing XML.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6VB0FL/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The issue that you show says 1.7.12 fixes the problem and given BIRT 4.17 uses 1.7.15  there is some kind of contradiction or confusion there.

As @hvbtup suggests, if the sources of your report inputs are not secure then you need to secure those inputs such that they do not contain content that can comprise your server or can produce compromised reports.

I expect there are places where BIRT processes XML where we could and probably should disable some of the vulnerable aspects in the existing XML libraries, e.g., entity resolution and external DTDs.  But who is going to do that work or fund that work?  I expect no one will do either.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6VB-0o/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I understood, that
- Birt does not use rhino for processing XMLs ( i obviously misunderstood what rhino does and what it is for)
- Despite securing the report inputs a patch in birt directly would be awesome, but I unterstand, that patching this issue is unlikely due to missing resources/capacities.

Securing the report inputs is what we already did. 

So I guess this issue will/can be moved to your backlog for maybe fixing in the future?

And https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/xml-xxe-pitfalls-with-jaxb implies that this library uses unsafe defaults.
On https://github.com/nokia/OWASP-CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md it looks similar.

There are a lot of places in BIRT where XML is processed, and as far as I understand it, one needs to explicitly configure the parser to work in a safe way befure using it.

So I think, to make XML processing secure everywhere in BIRT, there are quite a lot of places in the code where this configuration code must be added.
OTOH, most of these places is where XML files from the local file system are parsed, so, if we assume that these files are under our control, it's not really an issue.

The XML datasource is different here, because the XML data might come from eg. a WebService, which should be considered an untrusted source.
So I think it makes sense to add code for safe configuration to the place where the XML data from an XML data source is read.

Probably this is somewhere in https://github.com/eclipse-datatools/datatools/tree/master/plugins/enablement/org.eclipse.datatools.enablement.oda.xml/src/org/eclipse/datatools/enablement/oda/xml/util.

I created [an issue](https://github.com/eclipse-datatools/datatools/issues/22) in the datatools plugin repo for this.

Once this is fixed in the datatools plugin, BIRT should use the fixed version of this plugin.

My problem is now, that the filter expression will not apply, while fetching the values of the parameter with help of the java method: IGetParameterDefinitionTask#getSelectionList

Yesterday the issue #2010 was reported for BIRT 4.18 for thedocx-output.
Of course I was able after deep investigation that there is a topic with grin-in-grid/table-in-table and combinations.
The reason is the feature #1957 and the partial removed ""empty paragraphs of word"".

I provided a fix for that PR #2011.

Question to your side, could we provide a BugFix release of BIRT before original planned March 2025?
Yes, we have 2 options to avoid the error at BIRT 4.18 designer-property & user-property
but at the end it is a very significant bug for docx-output.

So I would interested to hear your points for kind of BugFix-release or release like planned.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6Xq5fw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Because I talk about the usage of the designer and not to work with the XML-structure directly.
With the designer you can change the property very easy:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37277ff4-0fb4-4fa9-aeeb-2590899529d7)

If you want to change it really on XML-level here are the first lines of such report and the property key is ""wordWrappedTableForMarginPadding"" and this tag must be added to your report.

By the way, the latest nightly build is available with the fix of that issue.

We can reproduce the issue using this simple rptdesign:
[report.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18360220/report.zip)

I did a first research to try to identify where the issue could come from. I found a pointer in [AreaFactory](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/blob/bd4d5ea68c9780af5fd56a25ee564ce030ba3694/engine/org.eclipse.birt.report.engine/src/org/eclipse/birt/report/engine/nLayout/area/impl/AreaFactory.java#L75) as we can see that there is a special handling of total-page autotext in PDF and Run and Render mode. I suppose that the TemplateAreaLayout returned in this case results in a different layout than the InlineTextArea that would be returned for a ""page number"" autotext.

Only after all pages are written does BIRT know the total page count (AFAIK).
That's why a PDF XObject must be used for the total page count. You can forward-reference a PDF XObject in a page and add the details for the XObject later. This way, BIRT can create the PDF in one pass.
Some other tools need two or even more passes for creating the output if there is any forward reference. An example for this is TeX.

Since BIRT does not know how many digits are needed for the page count (up to 9 pages, one digit would suffice, up to 99 pages, 2 digits would suffice etc). BIRT is quite pessimistic and reserves room for  5 or 6 digits (I don't know the details).

If you want to show the total page number left-aligned, this ""reserved width is too much"" is not really an issue; you can try to set a negative right margin.

But if you want to show it inline or right-aligned, then the issue is that you don't know the number of  digits needed, so the negative right margin approach is not easy.
Only if you know how many digits exactly are needed, you can try to use this trick.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6Zxm07/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thank you, @hvbtup , for your explanations.

* width: not set
* height: not set
* proportionalScale: true
* fitToContainer: true

In the `onCreate` event of the image, I set the height to 22cm:

    this.height = ""22cm"";

In the PDF emitter, this has the desired effect that the full image is shown and it is not distorted (the aspect ratio is intact), independent of the image's actual image dimensions (eg if it's portrait or landscape). The setting causes a maximum width of the container available width and a maximum height of 22 cm, and the image uses at most this given space.

In my case, the image is more or left quadratic, and the available width is 161.9 mm, so this is rendered with a height of ~ 161mm:
![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee404afa-8567-468b-9fbb-b15c40b635d9)


In the DOCX emitter, the effect is not as desired:
The emitter seems to ignore the combination that `proportionalScale` and `fitToContainer` are both true.
The image is rendered truncated:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84d6e528-47b0-4610-8b3b-8bb3fc274e51)

I attempted to fix this by also setting the maximum width to 161mm in the onCreate event.
In this case, the image is shown in full (not truncated), but it is distorted:

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b151770c-892f-4fe6-b255-6c7fdb86a45f)


If you wonder, why I don't set the height property directly? Well, I have half a dozen of places in the report where an image comment can be shown. Setting the height directly causes a huge empty space in the designer, which makes editing the design a torture.

Note that the images in this report are not fixed, they are stored in the database and their dimensions can differ, some can be portrait, others landscape etc.

This cause the effects and there are 2 effects:
1.) The bottom-line is unprinted because the layout-grid was avoid because it exists not really such style-element for docx
2.) The header-footer-height is unset because an empty grid was used to produce the correct height. This is not the right way but the solution to avoid the grid is only the first step. The docx-property of header-height/footer height must be set (currently not implemented)

In production, the reports usually contain a grid in the page header and footer anyway.

Following your suggestion is not an option for me, if this can be only set at report level, because as you said yourself, the whole point of most of the optimizations it to avoid unneccessary nested 1x1 tables.

The option `WordEmitter.WrappedTableForMarginPadding` is an option at report-level. You can find it under ""Advanced -> Emitter Word configuration"". This is a global configuration for al elements.

I tested the `showHeaderOnFirst` and I see the correct handling. The header will be avoid only at page 1, here ist my small test case, not beautiful but it shows the DOCX-output with `showHeaderOnFirst = false`. May be you have additional conditions to get your effect.

Strange...
I changed `table.rptdesign` slightly (set the content type of the HTMLDESCRIPTION dynamic text item to plain text instead of HTML and this is what the DOCX emitter gives me:

Show Header on First is unchecked (see image below) and this prevents the header to be printed on any page.

The Kurdish works with error till version 4.16.
I tested all my versions and with BIRT 4.17 and higher I got positive results - see my screen.

I copied your example text to 3 different BIRT-elements: ""Label"", ""Text"", ""Dynamic Text"" and the PDF-results seems to be the same like HTML. I used the testing directly from the eclipse-designer without HTML & I created the PDF based on the HTML-viewer.

```
Apache Tomcat/9.0.95
jdk-17.0.12
birt-runtime-4.17.0-202409160710 (i'm using the WebViewerExample with tomcat)

```

I have deliberately generated the error by mistyping a variable name (intervention_date___).
I case of error BIRT sends html with status code 200 and also sets the response header to ""text/html;charset=utf-8"". 
I want to emphasize that it's not about the error message content and that it's about the fact that app returns an html response instead of status 500.

We know very well about HTTP status codes.

Your assumption is wrong. It would be right if the WebViewer was an API.
Once again, it is not meant as such.

A 5xx status code would also be OK if the corresponding web server actually had an internal error.

From the perspective of a human using the browser to look at reports, the HTTP status codes are mostly irrelevant.
And some browsers hide important information contained in the response body or even give misleading information to the user in case of error status codes.

Regarding the fact that the output contains detailed error messages,
This is valuable information for report developers as well as for potential attackers.

A pull request which makes this behavior configurable via a System property would be welcome.
The property should use a safe setting by default, but the full info should be visible when the WebViewer is run as part of the BIRT designer.

If you still think that the HTTP status code should be changed, please create a PR.
Personally, I am -0 for changing it here, but I would not object.

However, if you want to specify and implement an actual REST API, now *that* would be a great contribution!","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6dAlXW/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Indeed it's very useful for BIRT Designer to see the error right away and i get it that it's main destination was not for the end user.

I'm using Eclipse BIRT Report Designer to generate reports in PDF format, but I’m facing issues with rendering Khmer Unicode Font. The Khmer characters either:

- Appear as blank or missing text, or
- Show incorrect khmer characters.

I've tested generating a simple PDF using OpenPDF with the Hanuman font. Here’s the code I used:

```
import com.lowagie.text.Document;
import com.lowagie.text.DocumentException;
import com.lowagie.text.Font;
import com.lowagie.text.Paragraph;
import com.lowagie.text.pdf.BaseFont;
import com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws DocumentException, IOException {
		// Output PDF file
        Document document = new Document();
        try {
			PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream(""Khmer_Font_Test.pdf""));
		} catch (DocumentException | FileNotFoundException e) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
        document.open();
        // Load Hanuman TTF font
        BaseFont hanumanFont = BaseFont.createFont(""/Users/sinsarath/eclipse-workspace/SamplePdf/fonts/Hanuman.ttf"", BaseFont.IDENTITY_H, BaseFont.EMBEDDED);
        Font font = new Font(hanumanFont, 14); // Set font size to 14
        // Add Khmer text
        String khmerText = ""លេខ"";
        document.add(new Paragraph(khmerText, font));

        document.close();
        System.out.println(""PDF generated successfully!"");
	}
}
```

Result are render not correct:

I ahe the report added.

The core reason is given through the following conditions in your report:
1. structure table in a table / grid in grid - excel makes no difference between grid / table
2. merged group cell of the inner table
3. changed API which creates the excel files

The BIRT 4.8 integrated an old version of the excel creator engine (Apache POI) and there were 2 different ways given to create excel (xls-own type, xlsx-own type).
With the updates of the excel API through Apache the excel engine was changed to use the same behavior for xls & xlsx (merged 2 types to 1 type) only the final format is different.

This is the reason why xls was working with 4.8 but not with 4.18. I have tested xlsx and this got the error with both versions.

You have 2 solutions to solve the problem:
1. avoid the merge of the grouping-footer
2. acoid the grid around the table and use directly the table without grid to have only 1 table

I hope this can help you to solve your topic.

You confirm this is not something that can/should be fixed on Birt side ?

I guess we will have to change our reports to avoid this kind of structure that trigger the error,
The thing is that we have more than 90 of them...

So yes, the used APIs will be optimized from this history point.

And we doesn't talk about a bug this is the standrad of the current excel-api.
Please try to think you try to print in an excel cell an additional table and then with merges.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6eHMo5/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The best way yes is to optimize your report layouts and avoid tabel in table for excel.

**Workaround**
If you use the BIRT-preview and create afterwards the excel then you didn't get the error.
Because the generated preview (HTML) will be used like an intermediate format which tries to handle your tabel-in-table.
If you have BIRT integrated into your software you would need a seperat Run-Task and Render-Task then you have se same effect.

(If you start excel from designer directly a RundAndRender-task will be used without the HTML-converting.)

Please be aware there is no gurantee that this way will work for all of your reports because the may problem is still into your report which means table-in-table is not a good solution for excel generation.
So from my point of view I would optimize the reports step by step.

And the answer to your question, this behavior cannot be changed throuh a BIRT optimization.
There are so many options possible like table-in-table-in-table-in-table which works for PDF but never for excel.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-birt/birt/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAS5yZc6eHOaX/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
