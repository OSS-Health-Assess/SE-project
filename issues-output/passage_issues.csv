Results are interesting and worth to be discussed. 

### We use 
 - **JUL**  directly,
 - **OSGi logging** in *some* equinox-based bundles,
 - **SLF4J** in a sporadic way,
 - **Jetty logging** for `JettyServer`

### How we do this
1. **JUL** directly
    - all the `*Messages.java`
    - org.eclipse.passage.`lbc.internal.equinox`.conditions.ServerConditionArbiter
   -  org.eclipse.passage.`lic.internal.equinox`.requirements.BundleCapabilityResolver
    - org.eclipse.passage.`lic.internal.hc`.HcConditionMiner
    - org.eclipse.passage.`loc.internal.licenses`.core.LicenseMailSupport
    - org.eclipse.passage.`loc.workbench`.dialogs
2. **OSGi logging**
    - org.eclipse.passage.`lbc.internal.equinox`.ServerRunnerImpl
    - org.eclipse.passage`.lic.internal.equinox`.requirements.ComponentConfigurationResolver
3. **SLF4J**
     - org.eclipse.passage`.lbc.internal.equinox`.conditions.AcquireConditionActionExecutor
     - org.eclipse.passage.`lic.hc`.HttpRequests
     - org.eclipse.passage.`loc.internal.workbench`.LocDomainRegistryAccess
 
### Findings
1. One physical package exploits several logging frameworks 
2. Each particular framework does not seem to have a peculiar reason to be used here or there. 
 
### Question
Should we put things here in some order? 

### Suggestion
I think, that, for understandable causes (like, say, logging configuration),
 there should be
 -  either a static choice (like, JUL) 
 - or some reasonable strategy for choosing a framework. 
    Like:
      - OSGi logging for OSGi/Equinox dependent packages  
      - [SLF4J+JUL](http://jkssweetlife.com/configure-slf4j-working-various-logging-frameworks) for the rest of the bundles

What do you think, colleagues?

This meta-issue is dedicated to discussions and approriate BugZilla tickets tracking. 

### Statement
Licansing Operator Client knows a lot about customers - who are they, which products they are interested in, when and which licenses have been issues for them, - all the stuff. 

The idea of the feature is to use this information to _notify_ a customer of relevant events - new releases, actions, whatever. 

### Workflow suggested
How an operator gonna do this? 

In a sentence, one is going to export the *customer base* to **csv** file(s) with all necessary information, and then, occasionaly, send hand-crafted mails to subset of this base - with or without  help of Passage. 

### Tasks
1. CSV export 
   - invent a csv format with the all information enough for the basic use case
   - implement export of *customer base* to this format.
  
2. Notification
   - provide a way for an operator to easily select a subset from *customer base*, basing on some criteria (like, say, product line of interest)
   - provide a way for an operator to send pregenerated/hand-crafted  notification mails to the customers for a subset

    According to the current vision, all actual mail sending is currently happens without Passage been involved.

#### types of errors for a AC phase

|code|description|sample|expectation|action|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|SCE|Passage services configuration error|no services of some kind registered in framework; a service cannot operate as failed to get demanded runtime context or is poorly configured|All framework-supplied registries must be valid. All configured service must be functional. |Any misbehaviour here means sabotage and must block the flow. |
|PDE|Product development  error|  insufficient attributes for bundle-resident requirement|Product must be configured properly.|All development errors must fail the flow for quick fix.
|MRE|morsel processing runtime error|IO error on a license file reading|Environmental denials are inevitable. Just face'em and report'em. |Just proceed with the next morsel|
|MBLF|a morsel processing is treated unsuccessful according to a service's business-logic|condition that has not been met in the current runtime environment|Love this type of failures.|Proceed according to business-logic.

 |---|---|---|---|---|
 |sample|No resolution services in framework; BundleContext is unavailable in BundleRequirements | bundle-resident `licensing capability` is empty or does not contain `feature id` | not expected |not applicable|
 |treatment reasoning|even for a single resolution service, means sabotage of the framework. Thus we treat any CE as a severe (blocking) error.|deserves severe treatment as well, as most probably means development error|

 |sample|a service: no network connection, un-operable floating server settings|not applicable|not 200 response from floating server, corrupted response payload; IO exception on license file reading, content decoding or parsing failure. |not applicable|
 |treatment reasoning|If a miner is supplied by framework, it is expected to work.|product development can break nothing here|try with another license file, if any. There can be a valid one just beside.| no condition mined is itself a failure marker according to embracing business-logic|

 |---|---|---|---|---|
 |sample|not applicable|not applicable|No necessary tool-services for a particular condition content-type and evaluation type: parser, assessment or evaluation. |a condition does not pass a check against the current runtime environment |
 |treatment reasoning|we supply only internal emitting service which cas transparent configuration| |We have no tools to deal with this condition type, but it does not mean we will fail totally: try net condition.|Innate evaluation failure. |
 |error type|| |morsel failure (suspicious)|morsel failure (ok)|
  
 ####  4 examining requirements against permissions
 | |SCE|PDE|MRE|MBLF|
 |---|---|---|---|---|
 |sample|not applicable|not applicable|not applicable|a permission does not fit for the required feature version|
 |treatment reasoning|only internal implementation without environmental dependencies| | |perfectly ok, but must be covered (now just filtered) with some diagnostic event|
 |error type| | | |morsel failure (ok)|
 
 ####  0 overall process
| |SCE|PDE|MRE|MBLF|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|sample|no key service of some sort is available at runtime|framework supplies an empty registry for services of some type|not applicable| not applicable|
|treatment reasoning |We mean that development provide full feathered framework, thus we treat each such occasion as a sabotage attempt|all these cases are covered by contract tests and must be treated as crucial development error| | |

This sample project does a lot of useful work and finally reveals Passage governance: been run, such an RCP product exposes a licensing dialog conveying ""no license"" status and related practical details. 

In te scope of this task we should also make it easy for this developer to complete the licensing scenario. 

How exactly? We have a plan.

1. Near the sample `e4 rcp` project, right in the same workspace, generate two more projects. These guys are to contain all the pregenerated work result we assume to be done in our Operator Client in order to `issue a license` and thus complete the licensing scenario.

2. The first additional project, `e4 rcp maser`, should contain meta-data of our sample-product-under-licensing marketing infrastructure: `product line`, `features`, `feature versions`, etc. 
Recommended structure:
 - e4.rcp.master
   - licensing
     - features/  (xmi-files here)
     - products/  (xmi-files here)
     - ... (folders for other required passage configuration model structures)

All these `features` and `products` folders contain sufficient set of emf model files that are available for editing with EMF tooling (which must be installed preliminarily, and this step needs to be described somewhere in the `master` project as well).

3. The second additional projects `e4 rcp operator` is to contain pregenerated set of business-sensitive part of passage data such as product keys, customer base and issues licenses. 
Recommended structure:
- e4.rcp.master
   - licensing
     - keys/      (xmi-files here)
     - users/     (xmi-files here)
     - licenses/  (xmi-files here)
     ...

4. Describe both projects exhaustively (say, in one's README files). Explain type and dedication of artifacts generated, they roles in licensing scenario, requirements/best practices for the artifacts keeping. Like, `e4 rcp operator` should not share vcs repository with `e4 rcp master` as the former one aggregates business-sensitive data and should be accessible by persons with higher privileges.

5. Put (say, in a base project's README) an instruction for further steps with all necessary details: how (and where from) to download Operator Client, how to open additionally generated files there, how to actually issue a license. 


The task is general and is intended to be decomposed.

  - metadata for products and customerst
  - product version keys
  - issued licenses

Currently we store them in home-dir with not much of a structure, which makes the long-term management and migrations complicated. 

The idea is to exploit Eclipse Workspace for the purpose. 

```
------------------------------------------------------------
Draft of the workspace structure is the following  
 - /features (*.features_xmi files to keep Feature Sets)
 - /products (*.products_xmi to keep Product Lines)
 - /users    (*.users_xmi to manage Customers and Users)
 - /plans    (*.licenses_xmi to keep License Plans)
 - /keys     (storage for generated keys for Product Versions)
 -   /<product-id>
 -      /<product-version>
 -         <product-id>_<product-version>.pub
 -         <product-id>_<product-version>.scr
 - /issued   (all issued licenses)
 -   /<product-id>
 -      /<product-version>
 -         /<user-origin>
 -            /floating (floating liecnse packs)
 -               /*<floating-license-pack-id>
 -            /personal
 -               /<user-id>  (personal licenses)
 -                  *.lic
 -                  *.licen
               
------------------------------------------------------------
```

For a company, which uses Operator to issu licenses only for it's own product lines there can be only one Workspace of this structure. 

For a service centers, that supplies license issuing and management for another vendors' products, there should be one Workspace per vendor.

As it's been found during discussions, all the data relative to a product licensing can be separated to three groups, each of which 
 - has a particular lifecycle
 - is managed by a used of distinct role, 
 - defines it's own rules of visibility and access, 
 - has particular level of sencibility and business value 
 - assumes distinguishable scenarios for data loss prevension

[1] 'definition': products and features are usually declared by development/ management, amended rarely and forms a ground for  ​
[2] 'evolution' data: product versions and feature versions (deliveries) managed by development, amended incrementally
[3] 'licening' artifacts: 
 - customer dase, 
 - encryption keys, 
 - license plans definition, 
 - actually issued license packs. 
In general case licensing activity 
 - is performed outside of development and dev management, 
 - deals with sencitive data (like maybe user personal information) and
 - business-valuable data (like customer base, product version keys, issued licenses). 
This part of a licensing project should be 
 - kept separately, 
 - available for a tight circle of operation officers
 - be maintained with regular secure backups

This separation should establish a base for the future product licensing workspace.

The way to delete a registerable entry is to go to `registry explorer` and do so in a dedicated, adminning context - here `delete` action looks different (trash bin icon at the right corner of top toolbar) and, after confirmation, deletes an entry from a registry. 

In case of `User Origin` actual xmi-file is not deleted from the file system. 

Let's rethink our approach to deletion functionality. We should not expose action, which cannot be enabled and we should do something with file-system resources (say, use configurable attic idea or additional confirmation for file system removal, or invent something else)

On a product verison creation on a fresh installation you have to deal with `secure token` and `installation token` fields with no keys generated. 

Only `Show` buttons are available the these fields. Press on a button, and there will be approximately the following text:

RootClassifierWizard::protected void store(String path, EObject candidate)
does pretty straightforward things: 
```
------------------------------------------------------------
1                URI fileURI = URI.createFileURI(path);
2		Resource resource = resourceSet().createResource(fileURI);
3		resource.getContents().add(candidate);
4		LocWokbench.save(resource);
5		registry.registerSource(fileURI.toFileString());
------------------------------------------------------------
```

Line 3 causes XMIResource-replenichment notification firing, which ends up in `FeatureDomainRegistry::registerFeatureSet` call  

Line 5 triggers XMIResource-load, which also leads to this `FeatureDomainRegistry::registerFeatureSet`

Should we clean the `FeatureDomainRegistry::featureSetIndex` prior XMIResource-load? 

Eitherway, this error looks cosmetic and does not actually causes the effects described in this issue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc46AI5_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When the user, on a freshly run product, switches ui screen to the one that has never been displayed yet if faces sort of loading delay. 

For example, leaving the dashboard view one opens 'Features' editor by means of 'Edit' select-a-feature dialog.

The user sees empty 'Features' view for seconds without knowing the status of this emptiness: is it temporary and loading is happening right now or is the product just experienced a local failure. 

Some sort of delay notifier should be exposed to the user for these seconds: a 'waiting' cursor, 'loading'  image, 'we are loading' text or something else.

Of token asessment phase LA can (not necessary) need to ask a client app for particular values (say, for hardware parameter used in issued license). 

It also keeps a license acquisition till it's released.

Further:
 - serve 'acquire' and 'release' requests
 - support json payloads content type

We have had success compiling the ""Eclipse Passage full feather"" template using the 2020-06 Eclipse IDE and JDK11. Our product is currently migrating to Java 17, but we have been unable to get the Passage demo templates to function using JDK17 and the latest version of Eclipse, 2021-12. 

The following errors were generated when building with JDK17 and Eclipse 2021-12:
[1645100281399.log](https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage/files/8096500/1645100281399.log)

Of particular interest are lines 19 (Unresolved requirement: Require-Bundle: com.sun.jna.platform; bundle-version=""[4.5.1,5.0.0)"") and 41 (Unresolved requirement: Require-Bundle: com.sun.jna; bundle-version=""[5.8.0,6.0.0)""), as there appears to be a conflicting dependency requirement.

It is possible. The simplest way I usually go for this, is to enable the preference recorder in my Eclipse's preferences, set those preferences I need/want and then let the preference recorder save it into my user preferences.

That's indeed better if one has more than one Oomph-projects with conflicting formatter settings imported into the workspace.

But at least in the preference files `org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs` and org`.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs` committed to the `org.eclipse.passage.lic.base` project I cannot observe any formatter related settings. I only noticed clean-ups.

It could be, if all the uses of JNA in OSHI are reviewed. But I would be hesitant to do that based on this [comment](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blame/master/oshi-core/pom.xml#L18) in OSHI's pom.xml (introduced fixing previous JNA issues in https://github.com/oshi/oshi/issues/1040):

```xml
<!-- Due to critical nature of OSHI jna usage, set to dependency management to help influence usage -->
```

There are many new versions of OSHI, so I would encourage upgrading rather than playing around with dependency versions.

The situation with different versions of JNA is known. However, the version of OSHi that Passage uses now works fine for our scenarios. I need to mention that Passage uses JNA a bit more intensive than Platform does, since we need to support things like license on removeable drives and so on. 
Switching for any newer version of OSHi will require testing effort from our side and I would like to understand better the nearsest plans regarding recommended JNA version to be used by SimRel before selecting new OSHi release.

currently the floating license server requires user interaction to fully start up, i.e. press  ""p"" to start the server.
This makes it impossible to use the fls as system daemon that automatically starts with your server computer.

It is unlikely and undesirable in any deployment scenario to require a human to interact with the server startup.
Why require user interaction here when it is not needed?

Compare to a webserver, a file server, any other server. Some of them have debug or interactive modes, but those are not the default.
Therefore, I suggest changing the startup behavior to always assume  ""p"", and add a new command line parameter, e.g. -interactive
that then shows the menu at startup.

FLS has not been designed as a deamonable server mostly because it intended to have wide interaction with admin, for exmple
 - to deploy a product license under the server
 - to perform diagnnostic monitoring during the server operation, etc

Meaning FLS needs interaction not only on startup.

So it's not the matter of one more cli-option invention. If we desire to have a deamon (background) mode, we demand operating without terminal (without interaction).  

Having this described, I would rather state the feature proposal as _Redesign FLS to support deamon launch_ . 

@jensgw, can it be that you doesn't actually want FLS to be a deamon, but more of a silent foreground application? Like it can still be the owner of a terminal to talk to admin, but does not demand attention if can proceed without it?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc5FuP-G/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently we do some testing with passage and FLS and see if it fits in our infrastructure. Immediately apparent was that the server component does not behave as a typical server would.

We would very much like a daemon mode, no console no terminal, if there are issues there is a log file the server can write to.

Requiring user interaction binds human resources, no server does that. That begs the question, why does passage behave differently? Assuming correct setup: a server should start up and begin operations and should never require any form of user interaction, problems are logged in a log file. There can be a debug mode where the server runs in foreground and logs are also displayed on the console. Compare to apache2, freeradius, etc. basically everything that calls itself server.

In general, if user interaction is needed it should be split out in a separate component, e.g. floating license server and floating license server control client. The later can be a client that connects to the server and can send commands.

Have the fls running on a remote machine, for some reason that needs to reboot, and now all users have to wait for an admin to press p before they can get licenses. Depending on how many admins a company has, that might take a minute, or days ...
Additionally a server that needs user input does not scale. Imagine a  large deployment of fls to lets say 38473 servers in a cloud environment. Those servers do not operate unless every one of them got the keypress p.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc5Fufrk/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Now I've got the core of misunderstanding and ready to explain. 

Passage FLS is an open source veriosn of Passage-based concurrent licensing solution. It has been designed to be illustrative for Passage power and to prove it's FL-support. 

Thus, Passage FLS is not a _typical_ server. It is just a headless application which serves floating licensing requests. 
It will cost some significant resources to make it behave as one. 

Currently [ArSysOp](http://arsysop.ru) team, who develops and supports Eclipse Passage project, does not have free resources to invest in the functionality you desire.

However, ArSysOp supplies commercial vesion of Passage-based FLS, which can be enhanced this way. 
We also can provide any sort of [consultation](https://eclipse-passage.github.io/passage-docs/#support) and ready to consider other forms of collaboration, should you have interest. 

Recently we launched a Cordon (Passage-based solution family) [support spot](https://github.com/arsysop/cordon-support/issues) suitable for git-users. Feel free to use it for any feature or contact request.

currently the server port of the floating license server can be specified with -server.port, this is good.

However, there is no option to specify the binding address, instead the ""wildcard"" 0.0.0.0 is always used, which translates to ""use all addresses of this system"". This assumes either
- that a server has only one network interface and that this network interface has only one address
or
- that the server should always listen on all addresses of the system.
Both assumptions are wrong.

A network interface can have multiple addresses. A server can, and usually has, multiple network interfaces. 
In most cases the server software (fls) should only listen on one address.

Therefore, I suggest to add a command line parameter to specify the binding address of the server, e.g. -server.bindaddress.
I have prepared a working solution to either provide a binding address, or assume as default to listen on all addresses.
Technically -server.bindadress should be a list of addresses. However, the solution mentioned above covers most use cases and is a starting point.

> Hi @HannesWell What exact version of OSHI 6 do you plan to propose?

Actually this issue/proposal was just to change the way how the mentioned services are obtained so that I can supply a custom service with another OSHI version independent of the one that Passage uses.

But if you are interested I can provide a PR to update the OSHI version of passage too.

I tested [OSHI 6.1.6](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/releases/tag/oshi-parent-6.1.6) locally which worked fine and lead to a (wall clock measured) ~30% faster license check. I also tested the latest [OSHI 6.2.0](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/releases/tag/oshi-parent-6.2.0) but unfortunately got an error on my local Windows computer, but I will report that so it hopefully gets fixed soon.

Besides performance improvements OSHI 6 also claims to be (almost) fully thread safe.

>  Does it accept Java 8?

Yes OSHI 6 also runs under Java-8.

> Will it align required JNA with Platform 2022-09?

OSHI 6.1.6 uses JNA 5.11.0, while OHI 6.2.0 uses JNA 5.12.0. According to the release notes ""This release leverages improvements in JNA 5.12.0 which should significantly improve performance."". So there might be an even greater improvement, if it works...

From https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1084 I deduce that at least the 2022-09 train uses JNA 5.8. I don't know what's planned for 22-09 but I assume that a more recent version is welcome.

A quick update on this. In the current snapshot OSHI 6.2.1-SNAPSHOT that problem of mine is resolved.

Furthermore my mail inbox said that @eparovyshnaya has answered to this issue, but I cannot see it in the GH web-interface.
I'll try to answer that nonetheless:

Yes `ServerAuthentication` is internal and I don't call it directly. But it is called when one uses the floating license server. Therefore it is used and I noticed the 'problem'.

I did corresponding changes locally and can provide them as PR to resolve the actual intent of this issue, if you want.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc5Fu1iv/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

From my observation it is currently random which condition is selected (i.e. depends on the order of elements in a HashMap/-Set).

For example we are using a custom access-cycle configuration that uses two `LocalConditions` and one `RemoteConditions` miner, similar like the `FocusedAccessCycleConfiguration.Wide` configuration does, so this issue probably also applies to all that use that config.
When a user has a operational floating server available plus a valid local personal license, it would be good if the Access-Cyle would always select the personal and acquires the corresponding grant over the floating-license.
This reduces the number of occupied floating seats without the need to disable the floating license locally.

At the moment I can think of two ways to implement this:
- Ensure the miner registries establish a stable order (e.g. via LinkedHashMap to maintain the order of the passed List) to get a stable condition order in the following process.
The priorities are then implicitly defined in the AccessCycleConfiguration through the order of the condition miners passed to the registry.
- Assign priorities to MinedConditions according to which the mined valid conditions are sorted before one is finally selected to satisfy a requirement
The priorities are then defined explicitly by assigning an integer priority to each condition.

The first approach seems to be a bit simpler to implement to me but has the disadvantage that it the priorities are not explicitly modeled and that it has to be ensured that the order is also maintained in the entire mining process.

thank you very much for the idea. 

It needs to say, that actual products never licensed both ways simultaneousely. `Wide` configuration is illustrative for the products, which do not yet know, _how exactly_ they are going to be licensed, as it is mostly the decision to be made not by development, but by management. 

Been that said, the feature looks worthful. 

Adding `priority` property to `MinedConditions` interface is not an option now. It is mature interface and it's worth lots of thinking to add anything to it. 

But paying attention to the order of services in a registry can be a way. 

Till this moment we declared that order of services is not relyable. 
If now we pronounce _order matters_ for conditions, for archtectural consistency we msut do the same for all the services for which interfaces multiple implementations can be supplied. 

It means that 
 - AccessCycle implementation must be changed significantly
 - all the access cycle services invocations must be revised from this point of view, reimplemented
 - exhaustive testing must be supplied. 

Any change to AccessCycle logic mean _major_ version increment, so we plan it for 3.0.0.

For now I found a simple workaround, using the JointRegistry, to create a registry that maintains a stable service order. Actually one could also use a custom implementation of the `Registry` interface:
```
	private static <I extends ServiceId, S extends Service<I>> Registry<I, S> createRegistry(List<S> services) {
		// Workaround to have a registry that maintains a stable service order, unlike ReadOnlyRegistry
		List<Registry<I, S>> regs = services.stream().map(ReadOnlyRegistry::new).collect(Collectors.toList());
		return new JointRegistry<>(regs);
	}
```

However this works well actually, the only problem that prevents me from using the described feature now, is is that in the end of the condition mining the stable order is lost because `org.eclipse.passage.lic.base.FeatureFilter` and `org.eclipse.passage.lic.base.conditions.FeatureConditionPack`use an ordinary `HashSet` (i.e. `Collectors.toSet()`) to collect the elements that pass the filter.

It should be sufficient to change that collector to one that ensures stable ordering, for example `Collectors.toList()` or `Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new)`. The method signature only specifies `Collection`, so both are suitable from that perspective. From the behavioural point of view, I think changing those filters to maintain the input order is not harmful. Those filters don't specify that they are shuffling, actually I would have even expected the opposite, that a filter maintains the input order and just maybe does let some elements pass.

Are you willing to accept a PR that in both cases changes the `Collectors.toSet()` to  `Collectors.toList()` respectively `Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new)`? If so, I suspect you used `toSet()` for a reason and therefore in favour of the second option.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc5F5L9z/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

To implement general _service ordering_ feature, it requires some rethinking of major part of Passage Core.

I understand that a general `service ordering` feature requires major work and changes that can only be done for a major release.

All I'm asking for now is to accept a PR to change the stream pipelines in `org.eclipse.passage.lic.base.FeatureFilter` and `org.eclipse.passage.lic.base.conditions.FeatureConditionPack` to use `Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new)` instead of `Collectors.toSet()`).
Please tell me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding it is not a requirement for those filters to shuffle the elements and should therefore not be harmful for Passage.

I understand that this is not crucial for you, but I would appreciate if that small change is implemented and therefore offer to do the work and create a PR.

In those cases it would be useful to enhance hardware expression evaluation to support the following:

- Parse multiple values for the same expression key and evaluate each value. This is PR #1115.
With that it would be possible to define an expression like `hwdisk.serial=123;hwdisk.serial=456`, which then requires the computer to have at least one disk with serial `123` and one disk with serial `456`.
- Add means to specify that there must not be more respectively that there are only exactly those elements (network-adapters, drives) than those that are specified in the expression.

Must say, Berlin protocol is simple by design and must stay this way. It found wide use in production and proved to be sufficient as it is. 

Passage API offers full set of condition assessment interfaces and the way to contribute them to the runtime of Passage core. These are your means, that we desigend for cases like this, intended to be used for the purposes of extension. 

I must emphsize, this is very much important point: Passage architecture offers huge lots of extensions exactly for the cases as yours. We discourage modifications in the favour of extensions, as having API this rich is a burden on our resources, taken deliberately, as we built Passage on best design practices, including _open for extension / closed for modification_ principle.  

In case you think your new idea of assessment could be interesting for others, I would recommend you to use supplied interfaces to implement your own library. It can reside, for example, on maven. Thus it could be used by any interested party for any product, protected by Passage.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1131,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1131,passage,1403721648,1131,Don't require log4j-core for o.e.passage.lic.base,HannesWell,44067969,Hannes Wellmann,,CLOSED,2022-10-10T21:16:43Z,2022-10-27T17:03:15Z,"At the moment the Plug-in `org.eclipse.passage.lic.base` imports the package `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config` because it uses classes from it in the class `org.eclipse.passage.lic.internal.base.logging.Logging`.
This causes problem for those that don't want to use log4j-2 as logging framework implementation in their application. In such cases one uses a bridge bundle that redirect all calls to the log4j-2 API to the actually used Logging-framwork implementation, for example logback. There are corresponding bundles for that and that works fine.
But the package `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config` is not part of the log4j.api bundle but only of the log4j.core bundle (both are from Maven-Central, not from Eclipse-Orbit, which is a modified form). Therefore `o.e.passage.lic.base` requires log4j.core even if that is not used in the corresponding application and `o.e.passage.lic.base` is required by many other Passage plugins, which then transitivly pull in log4j too.

Therefore I want to ask you to make `log4j-core` not a required for `o.e.passage.lic.base` anymore.
Currently I can think about two ways how this could be achieved:
- Make Package-Import `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config` optional in the Manifest.
Then  `o.e.passage.lic.base` is only wired to log4j-core, if another Plug-in or Feature with a non-optional requirement adds it to the application but it does not pull in log4j-core into apps launched from the IDE or build by Tycho/P2.
- Move the `Logging` class to a less basic Plug-in and remove the package-import entirely from passage.lic.base
Maybe `o.e.passage.lic.execute`, which also uses it and can export it to `o.e.passage.loc.operator.seal`.
But for the use in `org.eclipse.passage.lic.jetty` the class either has to be copied or the latter plug-in also has to depend on passage.lic.execute, but I don't know if that is wanted.

I can provide a PR implementing the approach you prefer.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1131/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes. For m2e we deploy a snapshot after each master build so one can try out a change about 20min after it has been merged.
Of course the jar/pgp signing has to be done then in the pipeline too. The M2E pipeline contains all of that.

If you are interested I can provide a PR to enhance the Jenkins pipeline and implement this.
If not already present you have the Eclipse infra team has to be asked to add the PGP secrets to this repo.

Eclipse Passage FLS was designed and implemented as a demo product to illustrate Eclipse Passage power. This statement is really important to keep in mind during any discussions regarding the product.

Any changes to FLS in the current product form-factor (demo) must serve this purpose.

Meaning, if FLS eventually stops doing demonstration because of a disfunction, then changes fixing this disfunctions are welcome. Like recent #1258. 

Change you requested does not serve main purpose of FLS, just lays additional burden without any benefit to the product. 
It looks like the change is requested for convenience of another derived product, unknown to us.

Been that said, it worth mentioning that despite FLS was never intended to grow to a fully functional or/and reusable product, it can be productized to this grade with a proper effort. 
Advantage of this new product form-factor would be official API and extension points, which could allow to build derived product in a more efficient way. 

We estimate effort to be several man-months, which we can dedicate, if [supported](https://eclipse-passage.github.io/passage-docs/#support).
Eclipse Passage FLS productization could definitely serve well to Eclipse Passage product family and open source community in general.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc5uymYn/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

While it would be nice to have fully productization of the FLS it would not be worth the effort for us since the current state is sufficient for us and I can also achieve this on other (of course less clean and elegant) ways and I'm happy to contribute from time to time when there is some need.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc5vHSZ2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Moving these two components' xml declarations `xmlns:scr` namespace to _v1.3.0_ indeed fixes the failure. That was quite an illustrative experiment, which leaves us with several open questions, which must be addressed before proper solution can be proposed:

The change from https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage/pull/1356 e.g. in `ProductOperatorServiceImpl` requires SCR 1.3 because the `Field Strategy` or `Field Injection`, i.e. using `@Reference` at fields, described in chapter `112.3.3` is only available since 1.3 of the OSGi DS spec (which has a different version than the overall OSGi release):

- https://docs.osgi.org/download/r6/osgi.cmpn-6.0.0.pdf
- https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.component.html#service.component-field.injection

In version DS version 1.2 chapter `112.3 References to Services` does not support that:
https://docs.osgi.org/download/r5/osgi.cmpn-5.0.0.pdf

> * why only these two components failed to load

I assume `@Reference` is not on fields used anywhere else.


Btw. if you contemplate to revert the change mentioned above, my suggestion would be to just continue with #1362 to fix the SCR files since 1.3 is supported by the Felix SCR (which is used by Eclipse) since 2015:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-4406
So requiring SRC 1.3 isn't a strong requirement.

On the long run I would furthermore continue with https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1365 to avoid such synchronization errors in total in the future.

Its not about verbosity of the XML file, but about using what's available because you now had to rework the code of the implementation to be way more verbose than it has to be.

But didn't not relying on the tools and trying to do/control it manually lead to this entire problem?
If https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1365 were implemented already, probably nobody had noticed that SCR 1.3 is required now because everything would just have worked and everyone would be happy.
The cause of a problem is usually not also its solution and I think it definitely isn't in this case.

The statement about submitting byte-code in the referenced issue might be exaggerated but in it's core it is right: One should trust your tools, usually they are right. Of course, like every other software they are not bug-free, but usually humans error far more often.

The default is specified as described in
- https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.component.html#d0e29091
`A component can have an activate method. The name of the activate method can be specified by the activate attribute. If the activate attribute is not specified, the default method name of activate is used.`
- https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.component.html#service.component-activate.method
`Specifies the name of the method to call when a component configuration is activated. The default value of this attribute is activate.`

If another platform behaves differently it does not comply with the spec and that platform should be fixed or one should worry what else is different there.

I want to emphasize that I didn't suggest to remove the component xml files from the built jars. In https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1365 I suggest to remove them from SCM/git so that they are always generated in the IDE and the build.

Yes, I understand, now implementation is closer to an OSGi spec and this is definitely good. 
My concern is about older Eclipse Platform versions. Will they interpret an `activate` method as ""activate"" if it was not mentioned in manifest? Perhaps only experiment can answer.
Another corner case introduced with removal of explicit ""activate"" is that I may have method with name `activate` in a component class [visible enough for whatever reason] and this method was not intended to be used for component activation. Will such a method be used anyway? If yes, how can I avoid this?

> I want to emphasize that I didn't suggest to remove the component xml files from the built jars.

Yes, I understand this. I'm talking about other use cases we have in our practice, when people want to build Passage bundles with another valid ""target"". For now we have required bundles ( + imported packages) and Java source level. In the case of removal we will need to specify a kind of ""target tycho version"" as well. The question is how to formalize this new build requirement.

Yes, that is required by the spec for quite some time see section `112.5.8 Activate Method` for example in
[OSGi Service Platform Service Compendium Release 4.1](https://docs.osgi.org/download/r4v41/r4.cmpn.pdf). Of course in the current versions it still behaves the same if no `activate` attribute is specified.

Yes it will be used and AFICT there is no way to avoid this. But from the link above you can see that this was the behavior since (probably) ever and only later the possibility to specify another activate method was only added later.
But if you think the spec is incomplete you can file an issue at https://github.com/osgi/osgi

You mean build from source? Then the pom.xml of passage already defines the Tycho version. I wouldn't expect that the build works with an older version (it can, but does not have to). And if you mean if somebody builds against passage bundles from a TP I can only repeat that the built bundles still contain the generated component's XML file. If you mean something else I didn't understand your case.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/comments/IC_kwDODBCaBc5-7Zhw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Production practice of Passage integrations maintenance reveals that _raw string identifier_ approach lacks semantic severely and thus affects one of the most critical integration feat.

Support reports direct correlation between absence of differentiating for _raw string identifiers_  - on one hand, and elongated implementation time with higher expences - on the other.

Hereby it is agreed to take steps to improve codebase in this aspect by eliminating raw strings that serve as identifiers for licensing configuration information and replacing them with entities that are to carry not only string information, but also shoulder semantic weight.

Key focus should rest with integration API: `Passage` interface, _Access Cycle configuration_ interfaces and all the surronding facilities that developer of a product uses to protect the product with Passage. 

The rest of API  also should be revised from this perspective, as integration experience proves again and again that practically each extension point of the _Passage Runtime Engine_ gets used every so often.

By making actions contextual we improve dialog ""passability"" a lot, because in this case people can guess, what do we expect from them. It becomes like a ""wizard"", where you need to pass some steps before dialog lets you in.

All existing implementations, delivered with the existing Passage packages, that survey local file system, are strict by design - they do not tolerate a location, if it does not exist on the local file system. 

Meanwhile, there is a demand for lenient approach too. A product can configure a license residence, that can be completely ommitted in some editions of the product (like evaluation license for limited edition, academic license for educational edition, so on). 

Not a biggie, as in this case product development just implements their own extension from scratch as there is nothing for this case in-the-box.  That's what the extension point for.

In this scope there is a simplistic `LicenseCoverageCheck` to serve as regular License Dialog, but in CLI: it 
 - makes an initial assessment, 
 - offers user ways to proceed, 
 - takes user's decision, does what user asked, 
 - offers following options
 - and so keeps going on and on, until ~death do them part~ user decides either quit or finally is granted with the ability to launch the app and does so. 

This basic functions appear to be sufficient to many cases, so it's widely used. 

One of the usage, encountered recently, exploited this interactive facility in blind, automated mode. And it appeared that this interactive util is not suited for such an apprach as it does not offer `quit` option in case of successful assessment. Meaning user, who does not have problems with license coverage, can only proceed with the application launch (and then exit by means of the pp) , but cannot quit right there under controln of this CLI util. 

In the scope of this task it's meant to supply `quit` option for each possible choise set. 
Thus automated interation can rely on it and have safe choise for exit.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1484/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
