In order to implement a Profinet driver it is required to become Member of the Profinet Consortium. This membership is ties with an annual membership fee. The ASF could become a member. The problem with this is however that the ASF doesn't become  member in things that cost the ASF money. I have discussed this issue with the CEO of Profinet Europe and there might be an option for the ASF to become a member and someone else paying the bill. Only members seem to be allowed to advertise with the Profinet Logo and call their products Profinet Compatible.

In the last weeks we observed multiple times strange behavior when connecting to Siemens S7 devices.
We have not yet been able to trace it down entirely but I have the assumption that it is an issue with the PooledPlcDriverManager.

Whats the issue?
When doing requests (either via OPM or the “regular” API) we come at a point where all subsequent requests simply fail (and in some cases we were no longer able to send requests to the PLC from other instances, so it looks like the internal server went down).

Whats the setup?
When I remember correctly, all situations where this occurred used the Pool as Basis.
We had it both with OPM and the normal API but NOT with the Scraper.

I remember that I spent like a hole day at the Hackathon in Mallorca to get all timeout things to work correctly, as the S7 does not like when you simply cancel your request futures.
Currently there are two “suspects” from my side.

First, the pool calls the “.connect()” method on a now Connection it establishes but by API convention you also have to do that in your code so it gets called multiple times, which could fuck up stuff.
Second, connection can also time out (but its no future in our API) so in the Scraper I implemented it as Future with timeout (as I’m unsure how everything behaes if the pool starts to initialize a connection but then the “waitTime” times out and it abandons this).

We sometimes need to get data from 100 different addresses. Current processors doesn't allow us to create those strings on the fly. So we need to enter them manually or we need utilize NiFi API to create flows automatically. 

If those parameters allows us to use expression language, we can read a list from csv file or from database and then we can read them in a loop in Apache NiFi.  

So it will be very handy feature to dynamically specify the connection string and the address string.

For starting point PutFile processor can be examined. This processor utilizes expression language for it's ""Directory"" parameter.

[https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/PutFile.java](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/PutFile.java)

Notable Lines:

import org.apache.nifi.expression.ExpressionLanguageScope;

...

Define the parameter as expression language supported.

public static final PropertyDescriptor DIRECTORY = new PropertyDescriptor.Builder()
 .name(""Directory"")
 .description(""The directory to which files should be written. You may use expression language such as /aa/bb/${path}"")
 .required(true)
 .addValidator(StandardValidators.NON_EMPTY_VALIDATOR)
 *.expressionLanguageSupported(ExpressionLanguageScope.FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES)*
 .build();

...

And then script can be evaluated in the onTrigger event like

context.getProperty(DIRECTORY).evaluateAttributeExpressions(flowFile).getValue()

 * Error Code: 0x04 

if the user tries a write request and this is not explicitly enabled, we can definitely handle this in a nicer way.

To fix the problem, you need to select the PLC in TIA, go into the Properties dialog, select ""Protection"". You will probably notice there's an Access Level Table, but you need to scroll down (even if it looks as if there is nothing). There check the box in: ""Permit access with PUT/GET communications from remote partner....""

Would be cool if we could give our users a hint on this.

The PLC4x processors use all the attributes when writing, this is incorrect.  They will be writing the wrong things.

The usual pattern in NIFI is to have the attribute name follow a pattern, that can be read as a prefix, such as :

plc4x.address.

Then the processor looks for any attributes that start with that, and get the end of the address to use as the field name.

As is I would not think this processor would work in production.

Example of this pattern in NIFI: 
https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/7d20c03f89358a5d5c6db63e631013e1c4be4bc4/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/InvokeHTTP.java#L132

This is slightly different, as the processor above is looking for configured values, where I believe that the plc4x processor just want to write anything with the attribute name value.

This is doubly wrong, as attributes are kept in a map.  There will never be more than one named value.

The proposed fix would be -\>

- change the reads attribute to use a prefix pattern as  above
- only write out those that match through regex / capture

I need to report an another bug. 
As you know I am trying to read a very complex Data Bloc from a S7-1200, in the future I will try with a 1500. A picture of one of this block in in the attached picture.
I found a problem which actually is similar to the String problem I reported in [PLC4X-240](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/PLC4X/issues/PLC4X-240), in reading long array of Int. 
The software running in the PLC as a component which actually samples an analog value a store the data in long Array of Integer or Real. An example is:

```

PLC_CellValue_2[400]='%DB2:928.0:INT[400]'

```


or 

```

PLC_SpeedNotSafety[400]='%DB2:6542.0:REAL[400]'

```


Reading such a long array of values is not possible because the request on the wire is for a too huge payload (probably this is the same problem we had with the string). 
I have attached the wireshark capture for you.

I did the comparison with the 0.6.0 version of the library and the array is correctly read. On the wire I see 3 read of 110 Integer and a last one of 70 which are my 400 Integer. 
As for this reading I have captured the wireshark.

just to complete the big picture my final target is to read a big DB. In this complex scenario there a similar problem that I think is a data request size problem too. 
If I try to read a list of variables like this one: 

```

PLC_ReportColpoDateLast='%DB2:0.0:DATE_AND_TIME'
PLC_@timestamp='%DB2:12.0:DATE_AND_TIME'
PLC_ReportColpoDateLastID='%DB2:24.0:DINT'

PLC_EncPosActSafety='%DB2:74.0:REAL'
PLC_EncSpeedSafety='%DB2:78.0:REAL'
PLC_EncSpeed='%DB2:82.0:REAL'
PLC_CellValue[5]='%DB2:86.0:INT[5]'
PLC_CellValueOffset[5]='%DB2:96.0:INT[5]'
PLC_N_TotPezzi='%DB2:106.0:DINT'
PLC_N_TotColpi='%DB2:110.0:DINT'
PLC_KW_Max='%DB2:114.0:INT'
PLC_CellValueMax[5]='%DB2:116.0:INT[5]'
PLC_CellValue_1[2]='%DB2:126.0:INT[2]'
PLC_CellValue_2[400]='%DB2:928.0:INT[100]'

```


The error I find on the wire is the same. Pleas note that in the list of variables there are no array of 400 samples but, I suppose, that the sum of all the request fire the same bug about the request of more than 240 byte length. 
I have attached a wireshark capture of this scenario too. 

Hope this analysis could help to find an universal solution for this problem. 

Regards,
Stefano 

P.S. As usual I am using the HellpPlc4x code and the latest compiled version of the 0.8.0 library.

I did implement the query optimizer to automatically split the request into multiple ones, however I haven't implemented a real query rewriting. So if you had for example tried reading 400 individual REAL fields (Or a number of smaller arrays ... where each fits into one packet) the driver would have split it up into multiple requests.

It takes a multi-item request and makes single item requests out of that and then merges the results back together. Even if it's the fool-proof thing to do, it's by far the least optimal one.

In your above case, when using an S7-1200 the result will probably be 4 requests as the max PDU size allows a payload of something around 240 bytes. If you were using an s7-1500 or 400 you might even get all items in one request as their PDU sizes is bigger. 

Problem is ... If we wrote an optimizer for only S7, then we'll run into the same problem elsewhere and we'd be writing the same thing over and over again ... if you feel willing to work on this, I would be happy to assist you. However right now I don't have the capacity to work on this.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85OgtZ8/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is a great low-hanging fruit, so I'll leave this here for someone to picup.

We already generally have the parts in place, however they are not quite correct:

[https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/develop/protocols/s7/src/main/resources/protocols/s7/s7.mspec](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/develop/protocols/s7/src/main/resources/protocols/s7/s7.mspec)

Defines a type: COTPPacketDisconnectRequest, however the third parameter is not class, but disconnectReason. 

The old TPDU is defined here:
[https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/rel/0.6/plc4j/protocols/iso-tp/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/isotp/protocol/model/tpdus/DisconnectRequestTpdu.java](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/rel/0.6/plc4j/protocols/iso-tp/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/isotp/protocol/model/tpdus/DisconnectRequestTpdu.java)

This should be an enum type. The constant names and values can be taken from here: 
[https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/rel/0.6/plc4j/protocols/iso-tp/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/isotp/protocol/model/types/DisconnectReason.java](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/rel/0.6/plc4j/protocols/iso-tp/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/isotp/protocol/model/types/DisconnectReason.java)

As soon as these changes are in place and the code has been generated, the logic for closing can be implemented by being inspired by the old drivers code:
[https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/rel/0.6/plc4j/drivers/s7/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/s7/connection/S7PlcConnection.java](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/rel/0.6/plc4j/drivers/s7/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/s7/connection/S7PlcConnection.java)

Reads from Mock devices work, but writes seem broken.

Scenario:

implement *MockDevice* interface and the *write* method. See that this device is set in the connection using the *MockConnection*.*setDevice* method.

When a WriteRequest is issued on the connection, the *MockDevice*.*write* method is indeed called, but the *value* parameter is always _*null*_. The given value to write is not passed through.

Debugging and looking into the sourcecode shows following:

*MockConnection.write* uses following statement to retrieve the value:

 
```

// MockConnection:147
((MockField) writeRequest.getField(name)).getPlcValue()

```

This retrieves the *plcValue* member from the MockField object. This  *plcValue* is written to by constructor *MockField(String address, MockPlcValue plcValue)* only. However, I did not find any call to this constructor.

 

Note:

Other Drivers seem to use
```

writeRequest.getPlcValue(fieldName) 

```

instead and do not have a value member in the Field class. (e.g. Simulator, Modbus )

I'm a bit new to the communication with PLCs, so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong.

I've followed the example of how to write a byte array to the connection, however I'm getting an INTERNAL_ERROR as a response code from the library and in the Wireshark the status from the PLC is inconsistent data type. 

I've attached both the sample project that's not working for me, my definition of byte array on the PLC and also  Wireshark capture. 

It's possible that I'm not doing something right, however I can't figure it out. 

Writing of most of the single values is working, however the array is the problem. And as far as I understood from the code and documentation arrays should be supported. 

Any help would be appreciated.

   I am using plc4x for one of our projects to develop a module which uses plc4x to establish communication with a sensor device using modbus RTU/Serial communication.

I am able to communicate with the device with TCP transport but not able to do with RTU/Serial communication.

I tried to look for some example/documentation on how to use RTU/Serial communication in plc4x but could not find any information in the website or the web.

Also looking at the documentation at [https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/modbus.html](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/modbus.html) it is not clear whether modbus supports serial transport as it only lists tcp and udp.

 
|Compatible Transports:| * `tcp` (Default Port: 502)
 * `udp` (Default Port: 502)|

Kindly request to clarify if serial is supported in modbus? if so could you please point me to an example/documentation which shall be used to understand how to use it for serial communication.

Anyways I tried to use the library/driver plc4j-transport-serial  [https://plc4x.apache.org/users/transports/serial.html](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/transports/serial.html)

to communicate with device in which the connection is established but it fails to read the data with following WANING.

I have been testing the connector and Kafka connects for a few weeks now. To do these tests, I try to ingest measurements from a sensor using Modbus, and this measurement ingestion is done correctly. The problem arises when I decide to remove the connector, as this connection is not closed by default with my sensor, which leads me to serious problems (due to the limitation of devices that read by Modbus, limited to 4 users per manufacture). The only way I can close these connections is to restart the kafka connect container. Is there any option or way to force these connections to close? Additionally, here are the steps to replicate this error: 

1. Initially, I don't have any connector launched, so I don't have any active connection: active: 0, waiting: 0

2. Then, I launch the connector using Kafka Rest API. At this moment, we're importing data into the kafka cluster. Using curl, we can see that the connector is working: curl -X 'GET' http://localhost:18083/connectors/ -\> [""modbus-office""]. We can see right now that we only have 1 active connection: active: 1, waiting: 0

3. I delete the kafka connector using the rest API: curl -X 'DELETE' http://localhost:18083/connectors/modbus-office. So, now, using the previous command from the previous point, we don't see any active connector, but, analysing the active connections from the sensor, it can be seen that there is one active connection: active: 1, waiting: 0. 

This is what is giving me problems, as in theory, there should not be any active connections at the moment. We have made a proxy to limit the number of active connections, but so far, we have not been able to close it manually using the REST API of Kafka or some configuration of the connector.

My name is Jeremy and I am the lead developer of the United Manufacturing Hub.

The United Manufacturing Hub is an open-source industrial IoT and manufacturing application platform enabling users to connect, store, and access all relevant data sources in industrial manufacturing sites and build user-centric dashboards and applications.

It would be really great if we could make a connection between PLC4X and the United Manufacturing Hub, e.g., in form of a configurable microservice that automatically takes data from various PLCs and pushes them into a MQTT broker. The United Manufacturing Hub (incl. Node-RED, Grafana, timescaleDB, VerneMQ) then provides the infrastructure and data models to contextualize the data and enable use-cases like OEE, Performance Management, Machine to Machine Communication, Digital Shadow, etc. Furthermore, the United Manufacturing Hub allows extracting data from other data sources as well like sensors, barcodereader or cameras.

Further information can be found here:
 * [https://docs.umh.app/docs/](https://docs.umh.app/docs/)
 * [https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/united-manufacturing-hub](https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/united-manufacturing-hub)

Looking forward to discussing how we can combine both open-source projects the most effective way.

Regards,
Jeremy

Section 7.1.2 Standard headers of the C standard says, in part:

If used, a header shall be included outside of any external declaration or definition, and it shall first be included before the first reference to any of the functions or objects it declares, or to any of the types or macros it defines.

So this isn't really right, I certainly don't think it is good practice in C.  

We should hav two ifdef's one in the header section and one where the code is

For a POC I'am testing PLC4X with ADS/AMS PLC.  the PLC is a CX with twincat V2.11.0 (Build 2216) on it.

So I made this test program with PLC4j (0.10.0_SNAPSHOT) to read 1 variable (BOOL).  This seems to work fine.  When I add a second variable (also BOOL) to the same request, I get an exception :

This error happened within an hour of application start so its most likely related to some CAN instability, however what's important is lack of proper handling of error. The connection in theory was still alive, however there was no data coming over it any more.

1. The document (here)[https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/modbus.html](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/modbus.html) seems wrong. It tells me the connection string format is: ""modbus-tcp:tcp://127.0.0.1:502"", but my test code throws exception saying no driver until I change it to ""modbus://127.0.0.1"".

2. My test code writes (or reads) some value via modbus tcp every 1 second, using short tcp connection (open and close every time). The memory increases every second until out-of-memory. In process monitor I find the thread count increases 1 every time the connection opens, but never releases, althought I consider the `try-block` shall closes it automatically. In fact, I see it calls `connection.close` after the `try-block`.

Test code:

```

        while (true) {
            String connectionString = ""modbus://127.0.0.1"";
            try
(PlcConnection plcConnection = new PlcDriverManager().getConnection(connectionString)) {
         
      PlcWriteRequest.Builder builder = plcConnection.writeRequestBuilder();
                builder.addItem(""value-1"",
""holding-register:1:DINT"", 30000);
                builder.addItem(""value-2"", ""holding-register:3:REAL"",
3.14);
                PlcWriteRequest writeRequest = builder.build();
                PlcWriteResponse
response = writeRequest.execute().get();
                
                for (String fieldName :
response.getFieldNames()) {
                    if(response.getResponseCode(fieldName) == PlcResponseCode.OK)
{
                        System.out.println(""Value["" + fieldName + ""]: updated"");
               
    }

                    // Something went wrong, to output an error message instead.
         
          else {
                        System.out.println(""Error["" + fieldName + ""]: "" + response.getResponseCode(fieldName).name());
                    
					}
                }
                System.out.println(""done"");
     
      }
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        }

```


It shows the connection is not cleaned properly.

I see it's more efficient to do this using long tcp connection (reuse 1 connection or use a pool). But short tcp connection should also work.

It looks like plc4j is considering it a structure or array.  If I read with

I can get the individual characters in the string by placing the actual index in \{index}.  So it knows where to start reading the data from.

Thanks for supporting this library.
 
I'd like to seek your advice on an issue I'm having surrounding *writing* to Modbus registers.
 
I have a code snippet as follows:
 
!image-2022-05-30-13-31-56-320.png!
 
I'm able to make about ~100 requests successfully, until I encounter a`{{` PLC Connection Exception: Error creating channel error{}}}. This is consistent with multiple tries.
 
*I've tried using `{}CachedDriverManagers / PooledDriverManagers{`}, but this will result in a NullPointerException when I tried to use its `{}PlcConnection object to create a PlcWriteRequest.Builder{`}. Essentially, the ""builder"" object is null:*
 
!mb2.png!
 
*However, I'm able to create `{}PlcReadRequest builders for reading data; no NullPointerExceptions{`}:*
 
This is how I'm creating the `{}CachedDriverManager{`}:
 
!mb3.png!
 
I've noticed that I will never encounter a maximum buffer limit reached for connections created from the `{}CachedDriverManager{`}, used to make Modbus read requests. Hence, I considered using connections created from the CachedDriverManger to make Modbus write requests, __however I get a NullPointerException whenever I try to create a PlcWriteRequest.Builder object from CachedDriverManager__.
 
Hope you could help point me in the right direction, been stuck at this for a couple of days.
 
Thanks!
Regards,
Max

The Migrated 1 channel(s) and Selector.select() log entires continues endless.

I've found that the call in NettyChannelFactory to:
```

@Override    
public void closeEventLoopForChannel(Channel channel) {
        if (eventLoops.containsKey(channel))
{
            logger.info(""Channel is closed, closing worker Group also"");
            EventLoopGroup
eventExecutors = eventLoops.get(channel);
            eventLoops.remove(channel);
            eventExecutors.shutdownGracefully().awaitUninterruptibly();
 
          logger.info(""Worker Group was closed successfully!"");
        } else {
            logger.warn(""Trying
to remove EventLoop for Channel {} but have none stored"", channel);
        }
    } 
```

eventExecutors.shutdownGracefully() never returns even though the above log indicates it did. I've changed the call to:
```

eventExecutors.shutdownGracefully().addListener(e->{ LoggerFactory.getLogger(NettyChannelFactory.class).info(""closeEventLoopForChannel:
Worker group finally shut down""); } ); 
```

in an attempt to eliminate any possible deadlocking.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Adding a record writer to the source processor is golden.

Unfortunately, the configuration has been changed, and the values to be read must be completed with dynamic properties.
In the previous version, there was a text field (PLC resource address String) where you could simply complete all the addresses to be read out.

Would it be possible to reverse this?  I have a project where I need to read out a lot of values via S7, adding this in NiFi now is endless work.

Handling of Bit Strings is in a bit of state of flux as there is a push to get all the drivers returning exactly the same types.

However, for the Modbus driver you can use the format 400001:BOOL[16] to return a list of booleans.

Each driver has the canRead, canWrite and canSubscribe attributes, these
can be used to decide between using a subscription based connection and a
read connection. I'm not 100% sure where to put this logic though,
somewhere within the Scraper?

That's awesome that you built the logix_develop branch :) It looks as though you are trying to use the opcua driver to communicate with it.

The connection string will be something like ""logix:tcp://143.21.40.239:44818?backplane=1&slot=1""

I haven't spent a lot of time on the reading UDT's but the general format of the address will be PRIME_SSB_IO.STS_TRIGGERID:INT

In the captures (pcap) you can clearly see that the problem is in the PLCSIM response, specifically the length of the ""Data.Item"" is 32, when it should be 4 (the length of a real in bytes).

The request job is correct byte for byte, relative to my local test.

The value of 32 would be valid if the ""Transport size"" were in bits.

For the moment I must point out that the problem is in the PLCSIM.

I did the test with version 4.0 of PLCSIM, please, if you can download and try with this version, you have a 15-day trial license.

I will be careful,

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/710,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/710,plc4x,1507647093,710,modbus-tcp Write Request coil always set to false,SteinOv,1490268,Stein Overtoom,git@overtoom.email,CLOSED,2022-12-22T10:45:47Z,2023-01-20T15:24:40Z,"This is a bug that is new in release 0.10.0 and did not exist in 0.9.1.

When doing a write request for a modbus coil, the coil is always set to false, no matter the value given.

it can be reproduced by running the plc4j-hello-world-plc4x-write example with the following arguments:
`--connection-string ""modbus-tcp:tcp://localhost:502"" --field-addresses coil:100 coil:101 --field-values true true`
Even though both values are set to true, the actual coils will be set to false. At first I tried it with code I wrote myself, where I encountered the issue, so the problem is not in the example code.


It occurred both when using an actual modbus slave and another library that emulates a slave:
```
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Slave {
    private static final boolean[] state = new boolean[1000];

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Arrays.fill(state, true);
        
        ModbusSlave slave = null;
        try {
            ProcessImage image = createProcessImage();
            slave = ModbusSlaveFactory.createTCPSlave(502, 5);
            slave.addProcessImage(1, image);

            // Start the slave listening on the port
            slave.open();
            while (true) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                        // Log if coil changed
                        if (image.getDigitalOut(i).isSet() != state[i]) {
                            state[i] = !state[i];
                            log.info(""\n===\naddr {} changed to: [{}]\n===\n"", i, state[i]);
                        }

                    }
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }

        } catch (Exception e) {
            log.error(""Modbus Slave error"", e);
        } finally {
            if (slave != null) {
                // Close the slave
                slave.close();
            }
        }
    }

    private static ProcessImage createProcessImage() {
        SimpleProcessImage image = new SimpleProcessImage();
        // Create coils 0-999
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            image.addDigitalOut(i, new SimpleDigitalOut(state[i]));
        }
        return image;
    }
}

```

I used the following modbus library:
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.ghgande</groupId>
            <artifactId>j2mod</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.1</version>
        </dependency>
```

I tried investigating the plc4j-driver-modbus package:
The classes in org.apacge.plc4x.java.modbus.base.field have not changed between the releases. 
ModbusProtocolLogic has been refactored into separate abstract ModbusProtocolLogic and regular ModbusTcpProtocolLogic classes. But functionally not much has changed. 
- Generated ModbusTcpADU class (renamed from ModbusADU.java) which is used in the write() (and read) method has changed. - I could not find any changes that could explain the bug, but I may be overlooking something.
- readCoilBooleanList() method (renamed from readCoilList()) has changed somewhat - is not the cause, I tried reverting it to the old version and this did not fix it.
- Generated DataItem class (renamed from DataItemIO) - I could not find any changes that could explain the bug, but I may be overlooking something.

I also tried going through the call stack and figuring out where the bug could have arisen. But it is quite complex with CompletableFutures and a lot of interfaces.

I would appreciate it if someone could help me point to the right place where I should look.

On line 144 in the write() method in ModbusTcpProtocolLogic there is a ModbusPDU object called requestPdu. This object has a field ""value"" which is a byte[]. In release 0.9.1 this array contains one value: 0 if false was set and 1 if true was set. In release 0.10.0 this array contains two values. The first seems to be always 0 and the second is 0 if false was set and 1 if true was set.
This array originates from the fromPlcValue() method. I hardcoded it to return `new byte[]{1};` and then the coils are set to true.

In the Apache Camel integration the connection is established in the constructor of Plc4XEndpoint instead of the doStart() method in the Plc4XConsumer/Plc4XProducer. Although this is not explicitly mentioned in the documentation, this is required for features like [disabling auto-start](https://camel.apache.org/manual/configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.html#_autostartup) or the [route controller](https://camel.apache.org/manual/route-controller.html) to work.
If no connection can be made at startup, the constructor of the Plc4XEndpoint will throw an Exception and the program will crash immediately.
So, to fix this, the connection should be established in the doStart() methods of the Plc4XConsumer/Plc4XProducer.

The NI OPC Server is primarily an OPC-DA server. There is no OPC-DA driver within PLC4X. 

However, I believe there is an optional package for the NI OPC server for it to support OPC-UA. You could then use the OPC-UA driver in PLC4X.

In either case, If you could outline a bit more about what you are trying to achieve and your architecture it would help.

Using Java as an example, PLC uses KEYENCE KV-7500 to read a 32-bit signed integer.

First step:
  configuration variables(Device information and register information)
```
{
  ""devices"": [                      
    {
      ""deviceID"": ""L1:D1"",          // device unique identifier(设备全局唯一编号)
      ""deviceName"": ""station-1"",
      ""deviceModel"": ""kv-7500"",     
      ""protocolType"": ""upperlink"",  
      ""host"": ""192.168.100.1"",      
      ""port"": 8501,
      ""connectTimeout"": 3000,       
      ""retryInterval"": 3000,        
      ""tags"": [
        {
          ""tagName"": ""output"",
          ""key"": ""L1:D1:output"",    // Globally unique key for each tag(Tag全局唯一编号)
          ""registerType"": ""FM"",     // register area (plc寄存器区域名称)
          ""registerIndex"": 100,     // register index (寄存器区编号)
          ""offset"":0,
          ""unit"": ""int32"",          // register data type (寄存器数据类型)
          ""count"": 3,
          ""readInterval"": 10,       // Read cycle, in milliseconds (读取周期,单位毫秒)
          ""timeout"": 60000,                 
          ""operate"": ""r"",           // read or write or (read and write) (读/写/(读写))
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Framework:
  框架的工作就是解析配置,建立与plc的链接,同时具备失败重连的特性,同时根据每个Tag的配置自动
  读取对于的数据缓存起来.将链接管理与协议解析对编程人员完全屏蔽,仅需要了解plc基本的寄存器
  区域,名称,数据类型等通用概念即可
  The job of the framework is to parse the configuration, link the device, and automatically collect the data of the PLC and save it to the cache

Second step:
  业务代码就可以非常简单,完全不关心plc的链接与通信协议
  My business code can be written like this:
```
public class Demo{

  public void onConnectSuccessfully(){
    // connection succeeded (链接成功)
  }
  
  public void onConnectFailed(){
   // connection failed (链接失败)
  }

  public void onDisconnected(){
   // lost connection (连接中断开)
  }

  public void onClosed(){
   // connection closed (连接关闭)
  }
  /**
  * Called according to functional needs (根据功能需要来调用)
  */  
  public void onOutput(){
    // Get instance by unique identifier for each variable
    Tag otherTag = TagMangager.getTag(""L1:D1:output"");

    // ==== read value ===    
    
    // Read mode 1. Read the original value, which can default to Byte
    Byte[] raw = tag.getRawData();
    int raw = DataUtils.convert2Int(raw);
    
    // Read mode 2. Directly obtain the value of a specific type
    int raw = tag.getInt();

    // >>>>> Business logic....save data to database, calculate, judge, etc.

    // ==== [Optional] write value ===
    tag.write(Byte[] data);

    // ==== [Optional] Read and write values to other variables ===
    Tag otherTag = TagMangager.getTag(""key"");
    otherTag.getXXX();
    otherTag.write(Data);

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/716,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/716,plc4x,1512732620,716,[Feature Request]: Apache Camel Consumer repeated polling,SteinOv,1490268,Stein Overtoom,git@overtoom.email,CLOSED,2022-12-28T12:08:50Z,2023-02-01T12:22:40Z,"### What would you like to happen?

It would be useful if the Plc4XConsumer would be able to poll the state of tags every x seconds/milliseconds. There is the possibility of adding a ""trigger"" with a period (I believe in milliseconds). I couldn't figure out exactly how this works from the documentation, but it seems that a plc tag needs to trigger the polling instead of it being solely time-based.
Right now I'm using a work-around in my own code by using a PollingConsumer that stops and starts the Plc4XConsumer for every request. But this isn't ideal.
So, I wanted to add the possibility to poll plc tags every x seconds/milliseconds.

I have two possibilities in mind for configuring this:
- The polling is activated if a period is configured without a trigger
- Add a new field for activating the polling, I could call it ""pollingInterval"" for example

I would appreciate some input for what is preferred.

Hi Chris, I did not get a response from anyone after sending an email to the dev mailing list.
I think time based polling is not supported, see my previous comment. Are you okay with it if I implement it in the camel plc4x repository?
I could implement one of the two ways I specified in my original post. But I also thought about a third option; I could implement it that you have to configure the trigger with a certain string (""timed"") for example and the period can be used to specify the polling interval.
What do you think?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85TSePw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

`plc4x://{ip-of-the-plc4x-server}?remote-connection-string={url-encoded-connection-string}`

I think you simply use the normal address strings you would use in order to communicate with the corresponding driver if you connected to it directly.

`plc4x://192.168.23.200?remote-connection-string=s7%3A%2F%2F192.168.23.30`

And then reading the addresses:
%DB4:4:DWORD, %DB4:22:DINT, ... or whatever you want to read.

As requested by @chrisdutz a wireshark dump when requesting a set of correctly and incorrectly alligned sets of modbus registers.

Notes about this trace:
- The device at hand is a solar inverter that conforms to the SunSpec standard.
- The requested field is this one (which apparently must be read completely): https://github.com/sunspec/models/blob/master/json/model_1.json#L36
```json
            {
                ""desc"": ""Manufacturer specific value (32 chars)"",
                ""label"": ""Model"",
                ""mandatory"": ""M"",
                ""name"": ""Md"",
                ""size"": 16,
                ""static"": ""S"",
                ""type"": ""string""
            }
```
- I have the device in an isolated network so I do an SSH with port forwarding to a jumphost. The effect is that all traffic is to and from localhost (127.0.0.1) and the port TOWARDS the system is port 1502 (instead of the normal 502).
- The connection definition is `modbus-tcp:tcp://127.0.0.1:1502?unit-identifier=126` 

In sequence in a single request I retrieve it:
- Correctly.
- Correct start address yet I get 15 instead of 16 registers.
- Start reading at the second register till the end. 


The console output related to this trace:
```

Only by following the constraints imposed by this schema can the library do the modbus calls that result in correct data.

Note that the mentioned SunSpec has an even harder schema definition.
For example this field (they call it point) [`A`](https://github.com/sunspec/models/blob/master/json/model_101.json#L31) (AC Current) has a scaling factor field [`A_SF`](https://github.com/sunspec/models/blob/master/json/model_101.json#L66) which means that the value from the registers related to `A` must be multiplied by 10^`the value of the field A_SF` to get the actual value.

So to get the value of the field `A` you must read the registers related to `A` and `A_SF` before you can determine the actual value.

I have been experimenting for a few months now on how to get to a form of schema definition that allows for all of these variants. I'm still working on that.

So please just treat this as an FYI around the fact that some devices show unexpected behavior if you try to read valid registers in a way that does not meet their schema.

I have been working (as a side project) to write the code needed to make this happen.
It needs a way to define a schema (modbus calls this a mapping) that is much bigger than simply int or float.
The hard part is that this must also ensure any modbus actions stay within the limitations defined by the schema.

What needs to be done is a lot. 
So much that I say it cannot be seen as a simple feature. It is a totally new functionality.

Right now I already have a partial prototype that works on my machine.

So I propose this issue is closed and I'll ping you when I have something that is good enough to show you.

For the sake of the size of these drivers, the PLC4X drivers don't have the same set of features the full blown drivers in Java and Go have. 

One of the features the C version is missing, is the query-optimizer, that takes care of transparently splitting up large plc4x requests into multiple smaller S7 requests. How this splitting is done, depends on the type of S7 and the corresponding PDU size. 

When using PLC4C you will have to manually ensure the PDU size of your PLC is not exceeded manually and you'll have to execute multiple separate requests.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85Uydhy/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That's why for example you can't treat even one string without explicitly setting the size, because then the return string would be 255 bytes long and already exceed the size. Doesn't help that the request is way below this size ... please have a look at the class https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/develop/plc4j/drivers/s7/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/s7/readwrite/optimizer/DefaultS7MessageProcessor.java

With solid hardware in testing I was able to get ~1ms time. Efficiency of this is 99% depending on hardware, unless you deliberately write code otherwise.

When s7 driver can't establish connection with controller it creates threads that being falling into park state TIMED_WAITING. While application keep trying to connect via PlcDriverManger.getConnection(url) such threads count continuously growing. In the end we have java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create native thread.

We are using s7 driver to communicate with different controllers from single app.

Screenshots just to demonstrate an issue. Driver creates thousands of such threads.

The timeout handling in plc4j is affected by its own logic where registered handlers are called only when packets arrive. This means that in some cases, when communication line is broken or simply hanged, timeouts may never be reported back to driver.

There were several attempts to fix that, however none of them have worked. The recent work in #818 shed some light on some of netty utilities which could be wired into the spi to separate timeout handling. Given that our use of netty in plc4j is never ending source of troubles and confusion (it orchestrates a lot!), we may consider introducing new SPI types to hide specifics, even between our own internals.

hi,@chrisdutz. I am  using plc4j to collect data from S-400. At present, the 425  tags acquisition cycle can reach 100-120ms. The data types include INT, REAL, BOOL. .I hope the faster the better，especially for the bool variable. It is better to achieve the acquisition cycle of 5ms-10ms，  Can you give some suggestions？ thankyou.

I assume the S-400 is a Simatic S7-400.

Due to the design characteristics of these CPUs you will not be able to obtain that level of data acquisition that really represents your data, you must also analyze the execution cycles of your program OB1 (typical 1 to 10 ms), OB35 (100 - 500 ms typical), etc. and its technological functions (PCS7, Braumat, etc.), this is based on the fact that the data in real time is not the fastest, but the one that really represents the state of the variable.

In the world of DCS with a second everyone is happy (well almost). In the world of Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) 1 millisecond is the norm.

If you really need a really fast variable update, like in PCS7 security systems, you can follow the guidelines in [1], where it sets out the software and hardware requirements.

You can also investigate the use of ALARM_8, ALARM_8P, for data that must be accurate depending on the execution of your program.

First of all, thank you for this project. It has been very useful for us. 

Using the latest version of plc4j (v0.10.0), we are not being able to establish a connection to an EtherNet/IP PLC, but using the previous version of plc4j (v0.9.1) all went well with the connection to the same EtherNet/IP PLC.

Below we share the log from PLC4j.

I think this will probably be related to some major changes we merged in recently, that were supposed to increase the functionality of the EIP driver.

Seems we might be needing a little more work on that.

## Summary
When a connection stored in the connection-cache breaks due to a network failure, the connection is not removed from the cache and blocks future uses of the same connection string.


## Context
Encountered while trying to solve a similar problem as https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/623 in the NiFi integration:
When a processor is running and the network connection to the PLC is interrupted, the processors continues to throw errors even if the network connection is restored.

This was brought up in a mail by me (https://lists.apache.org/thread/xm38nh8xzh1m1kj0y74dx0goo81cos82) that sparked a pull request by [heyoulin](https://github.com/spnettec) (https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/818), an issue by [splatch](https://github.com/splatch) (https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/821) and a commit from [@chrisdutz ](https://github.com/chrisdutz) (https://github.com/apache/plc4x/commit/9b06c2de0c77a7c1bbcb730bb5285c4435002c93).

The commit (https://github.com/apache/plc4x/commit/9b06c2de0c77a7c1bbcb730bb5285c4435002c93) did not fully addressed the problem, so I bring my attempt to fix it.

## Replicate the problem
In order to replicate the problem use the code at the end and follow the steps:
1) Start the main below
2) Disconnect network
3) Wait until errors are shown in the stdout
4) You will see the connection is been used after it fails:
```
16:38:22.486 [main] DEBUG o.a.p.j.u.c.CachedPlcConnectionManager.getConnection:72 - Reusing exising connection
Failed to read due to: 
java.util.concurrent.TimeoutExceptio
```
5) Reconnect network. The problem persists.


## Possible Solution
The LeasedConnection returns a Future that encapsulates the Future that connects to the PLC. The second one is the one that can mark the connection as invalid for removal. For the moment I have been able to work around this by overriding the `get` method of the first Future:
```java
@Override
public PlcReadResponse get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
        throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException {
    try {
        return super.get(timeout, unit);
    } catch (TimeoutException e) {
        future.completeExceptionally(e);
        throw e;
    }
}
```
You can see my solution in the zylklab fork (https://github.com/zylklab/plc4x/tree/Fix/nifi-integration-timeout). If you could give me some feedback I would like to make this into a PR as soon as posible.

I had a look into the nifi integration after updating the branch:
Found the S7 driver reconnecting, but the opcua didn't.
Tried the manual tests that posted in this issue with both drivers. Same result.
Additionally found that the s7 driver always reconnected after 15 disconnect messages. 
From this I take that it depends on how the driver interprets when there is a disconnection.

Not sure how should we handle the reconnection from the nifi integration part. Right now using it to connect to an opcua plc means after a disconnection a user must restart manually the processors or restart nifi.

Tried again with the changes I made.

If an exception occurs in the real connection the leased connection is invalidated. This is the first test.

I think is a problem that if the client gets a timeout in the leased connection the CompletableFuture of the real connection, the one that invalidates the leased connection, does not. This is the case that breaks the cache in my case, as that connection is no longer usable. I think a timeout in the leased connection should propagate into the real connection. Making the real connection invalid. Else the client has no way of removing the real connection from the connection cache.
This one is the second test.

Thank you for opening this dicussion thread.

Welcome to the PLC4X Project!

You find you questions answered below.

Feel free to also check-out our mailinglist. :-)

[Project Mailing Lists](https://plc4x.apache.org/mailing-lists.html)

> * [x] In one of the [FeatherCast talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWTwgdCxIx0), Chris talked about PLC4x for TypeScript. Is the project active?
- No this project is not active and has not been started yet. But we as PLC4X Community are happy to support developers aiming to implement.
> * [x]  If the TypeScript version isn't active, is there any plans to start it? How can one contribute to it either in terms of time or money?
- For the time beeing mainly developer willing to put time into it and get TypeScript started as a supported language.
> * [x]  Is the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/wiki/Help-Wanted) Wiki still up to date?
- Yes it it is still up to date - We are currently investigating into Multiconnection support in a more generic way. We started some specific one in Java for S7 protocol. Check-out our mailing list as well where we discuss these kind of things.
> 
> * [x]  Also, planning to use PLC4x in some industrial applications and confused between deciding PLC4Java v/s PLC4Go. Any suggestions which one is more mature or are they at par?
- For Industrial applications we are currently recommending to use PLC4Java as this is the most mature one. PLC4Go is quite close but not at par (especially for S7, but we are working on it -> See Multiconnection discussion)
> * [x]   Is the following [table](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/index.html) up to date?
- Yes and we have another one on our confluence site: [Drivers and their Transports/Protocols](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=255069989)

@chrisdutz Works okay after puling in the latest updates. Modified the dockerfile too:

```
# Build everything with all tests
# RUN ./mvnw -P with-c,with-dotnet,with-go,with-sandbox install
RUN ./mvnw install
```

Running a test without this change shortly.

Hi everybody,

I am a new user of plc4x, and I wrote a very simple program based on example to connect to an Allen Bradley PLC using EthernetIP protocol.  It seems to be connected, but waiting for the 'connectionRequestChannel' to respond forever:

`// Wait for the driver to connect (or not)`
`fmt.Println(""Waiting for the driver to connect..."")`
`connectionResult := <-connectionRequestChanel`

Here is a screenshot of the logs:
![image](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/assets/117114606/efb2991e-5575-4701-b17e-9ad457b2a81f)

Is it an Allen Bradley issue or a driver issue?

Thanks.
Charly

I believe this is only in the Java version though.

I would be very interested in seeing the pcap files from wireshark for both
the successful connection using 0.9.1 as well as a capture using the logix
driver on the 0.11 Java version.

The 0.9.1 looks like it is it reading 4 variables N40[17], N40[0], N40[16] and N42[67].

The 0.11 version is trying to read N40[17], N40[0].8, N40[16] and N42[67]. (Note the N40[0].8 address change, which is the problem as it can't find that address) PLC4X should definitely handle the response a little better though.

The 0.11 Go version is probably a write off, it really hasn't been tested at all.

If anyone else is looking at this, then changing the ENIP protocol's TCP port in Wireshark to 10123 allows the messages to be decoded.

N40[0].8 (A period in stead of a colon).

Having a go at copying the implementation of the Java version into Go would
be a very good start. If you are unable or unwilling to do it, then you may
need to find someone with a shared interest in fixing it.

PLC/Protocols:
Not sure which one below is for AB PLCs, I think EIP? Specifically Logix and Compact Logix PLCs. Also Siemens (S300, 1200, and 1500) and probably OPC UA. All are over Ethernet connections. The table [here](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/index.html) seems to suggest that EIP is not supported? 

I would like to have a POJO for UDTs. I tried to find an example in your repo and it looks like the OPM requires the tag address to be hardcoded? We would have multiple tags of the same type. Potentially hundreds of the same type. This is the first time I have used this library and I am pretty lost. We are using Java with microservices (Spring Boot) and we would like to use open source libraries if possible.

I used [PLCIO](https://www.ctiplcio.com/), which is paid, for a few years at my previous company, and it was pretty nice to use, for C at least. One of the nice utilities it had was a discovery program that scans all of the tags in the PLC and then it could spit out C style structs for any UDTs, with a special conversion string you can pass once you get the plc read part of your program. I think it can work without the conversion string, but their manual doesn't mention it.

What I am trying to accomplish is this:
Create POJOs of PLC structs/UDTs that are commonly used in our programs. These may be fairly nested. Similar functionality to jackson xml/json.

Then, we would have our list of tags to read via polling, or subscription if supported, using the root tag name in the case of a struct, or the normal types such as BOOL, DINT, STRING, etc. We would like the UDTs to map to a registered POJO, or however you would need to do it.

Example:
POJO without nested UDTs. 
```
package com.mycompany.devicecommunication.plc4x.UDT;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class HoldStatusRequestUDT {
    //Do I use PlcDINT, PlcBOOL, etc  type or just an int, log, etc?
    //Probably need some sort of Alias annotation, or make the field name exactly the same as the PLC.
    private boolean TRIGGER;  
    private int sequenceId;
    private String barcode; 
}
```

List of tags of type ""HoldStatusRequestUDT"" that we would read from
SCAN100_REQ
SCAN101_REQ
SCAN102_REQ

![image](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/assets/5222103/c545d7f4-4490-46f9-b354-5d3e766e3ae6)

and then I would expect updates for each tag and when we read, we would be able to map those values into the POJO.

Please let me know if this is already possible and maybe an example or two of how to do it. Thank you!

well actually you're joining the party to the exact right time ;-) ... Today I finally got the last parts delivered for setting up my CompactLogix controller ... we recently got quite a major refactoring of the existing EIP driver. However I wasn't able to actvely test it ... till now. 

So it is possible to read the tags and datatype information from the PLC and to read and write these UDT (User Defined Types ... for the others). 

We have somerhing similar in the Beckhoff ADS driver ... however the default is returning a map of strongly typed PlcValue objects (Objects wrapping the typical IEEE datatypes). 
We also have OPM (Object Persistence Mapping???) ... which you could use to annotate POJOs ... however this is a tool that hasen't received any updates for the last years. In theory it would make sense to combine the two ... to pass in an annotated class type and to receive populated objects, but that would be something someone would have to work on ... maybe you? ;-)

So I will be working on the EIP driver quite a lot in the next 1,5 months ... However can't I do any pormisses as another paid gig has priority over this.

However, if you want to help working on this, any help is greatly appreciated and I would be happy to help you.

the reason we decided to take the connector out of the confluence store was simply that Confluent kept on nagging us to do releases faster than the project wanted to (Whenever their tooling showed any vulnerable third party dependencies, they kept on opening issues with the Security team). The thing is almost nobody working on PLC4X is actually really being paid for our work. We simply didn't want to be pushed by a company earning money but giving nothing back to the community.  

If more companies using our stuff would consider giving back to the communities, I think we would have continued supporting stuff like the confluent store, but this way we decided to remove it from the store.

You should be absolutely fine with building PLC4X locally and simply copying the jar to your docker container ... or simply downloading a convenience binary from the Apache maven repository.

If you and your company need things to be in the confluent ecosystem ... you might consider funding someone willing to do the extra work for more frequent releases.

Hello,

Using 0.9.1 or 0.11-SNAPSHOT version, EIP or LOGIX, I have some issue reading array and no numeric values.

Examples:
1. ControlLogix: read PLC_2_Server.DMC1 => give me ""INTERNAL ERROR"" as response
2. ControlLogix: read PLC_2_Server[16] (which is the same than above) => works and give me a string as response
3. ControlLogix same issue than above with BOOLEAN
4. CompactLogix: read %N40[0] => works and I get a UINT which is the 2 first chars of a string
5. CompactLogix: read %N40[0]:8 / %n40[0]:INT:8 => Program crash with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

I attached Java error message and wireshark captures to help in understanding this issue.

Thank you for any help.

Hi, I think you can use the snap7 client to determine whether the data can be read normally. Or if you just want to confirm whether the PLC4X is normally used in your scenario, you can try it with a physical device.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85gZ4Nw/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It creates a connection, just the same way the normal Driver manager does it, but it doesn't close the connection ... the next time the same connection-string is used, it returns the existing connection.

This is what I'd expect from the driver, this is using the hello world write example from 0.10.0
There seems to be something odd going on with your setup.

But send through a packet capture, a list of the addresses you're querying and I might be able to figure out whats going on.

It looks like the Activate Session Request from PLC4X to the OPCUA server gets sent out 10 seconds after receiving the previous response from the OPCUA server.

Looking at the code to see what could delay it within the Activate Session Request  logic, there is a few calls to look up the hostname.

![image](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/assets/15604556/df107e4a-0994-4192-b8ad-a0a2e79c5bdb)

As the request does eventually get sent out, I suspect that one of these calls is taking too long too complete. Can you please try adding the OPCUA server hostname in the Hosts file on the client.

Something similar to this.

I find when developing new drivers, I use the existing drivers as a base and basically copy the protocol and driver packages for a specific driver, and then just remove anything that's not needed for the new driver.

There's some info on the developer section of the website, but otherwise continue to ask questions and there's normally people that will help.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85htHir/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. The way in which mentioned tools deal with our release is not related to issue. Reading your comment in reverse order I could understand that making no releases makes these tools happier. ;)
2. We won't stabilize things by releases, but do have a marker when things broke. With 11 months old snapshot you never know when things rotten.

I doubt if backporting a change made on a year old feature development branch (which develop in fact is) will ever succeed. It will work with minor patches, but not with new features which are based on i.e. MSpec generator updates etc.

Did I find that there are many times during the PLC4J testing_ The threads in the waiting state were generated when I was not connected to the PLC. I wanted to test and read data from the PLC, but these times_ Waiting will occupy memory and ultimately cause the laptop to crash. However, the connection was made using getConnect and was also abnormally closed using jdk8's try(). May I ask if this problem can be solved at present and how to solve it?

As @splatch points out, it is recommended that you post sample code (test) in order to identify the problem.

You have to differentiate the problem between the Cache handler and the driver itself. The number of tasks that the driver raises is limited (of the Netty and those of the S7 driver itself).

In the version of the S7H driver found in [1], it identifies the thread pools in order to differentiate between them.

When you open the request again, add a screenshot of the jconsole to be able to identify your problem, which is already quite strange.

The main is simple, when trying to code, VScode just dont find the module.

whatever other project I can import from ~/go/pkg/mod/github.com, so the problem isn't the IDE.

Why should I delete go.work? Even without this file, the issue persists.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1100,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1100,plc4x,1909573547,1100,[Bug]: plc4j-driver-opcua - Dead connection objects after session timeout,takraj,2440418,Rajmund Takács,takraj@gmail.com,CLOSED,2023-09-22T22:14:26Z,2024-08-30T11:02:26Z,"### What happened?

OPC-UA connections get dead after session timeout, which is hard-coded to 2 minutes in the driver. After this timeout, any request made with this connection object fails with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. In case of subscriptions, an even worse `ClassCastException` gets thrown internally, complaining about being unable to cast a `ServiceFault` to a response object, and because of this, the future object earlier returned by `request.execute()` never get completed.

This is especially a problem when using `plc4j-connection-pool`, which keeps a set of connection objects open, and thus users of the pool might get these dead connections.

The session timeout value is hard-coded in [SecureChannel.java:400](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/cac8254518540d6353546fcf7619203e2f64e721/plc4j/drivers/opcua/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/opcua/context/SecureChannel.java#L400)

Simplest code to reproduce the issue:
```
PlcDriverManager driverManager = new PlcDriverManager();
try (PlcConnection opcuaConnection = driverManager.getConnection(""opcua:tcp://opcuaserver.com:48010"")) {
    PlcReadRequest request = opcuaConnection.readRequestBuilder()
            .addItem(
                    ""Demo"",
                    ""ns=2;s=Demo.Static.Scalar.String""
            )
            .build();

    PlcReadResponse response1 = request.execute().get();
    System.out.println(""RESPONSE 1: "" + response1.getObject(""Demo""));

    Thread.sleep(3 * 60 * 1000); // 3 minutes

    PlcReadResponse response2 = request.execute().get();
    System.out.println(""RESPONSE 2: "" + response2.getObject(""Demo""));
}
```

Expected behavior would be to transparently recover from the error, and to create a new session internally.

I will look for where in the OPCUA standard this is mentioned, if its not then we should be able to set something up to poll data before the timeout occurs but it kind of defeats the purpose of the timeout.

Using the latest snapshot, I was able to confirm that this timeout does close the channel if no messages are sent after 2 mins with the code you provided. I haven't had time to test it with subscriptions yet.

The timeout is hard coded to 2 mins, I'm happy for this to become configuration parameter as, yes some people may want to poll servers less often than once every 2 mins.

Keep in mind that the timeout value is a negotiated value between the client and server, the server has the final say as to what this value will be.

The OPC-UA driver seem to leak memory when closing a connection object. This issue sooner or later lead to application crash with OOM error. Workaround would be to reuse connection objects, but then we face the issue #1100, which I believe renders a fix for this pretty urgent.

Hmpf ... I thought we had addressed that issue and I guess it probably also has an effect on all other drivers too ... Usually opening and closing connections shouldn't be the default case, as the connection-cache should be used, but I think having somethign stuck will also be the reason why some applications simply don't stop gracefully.

hi:
    It took me about three days, and I have fixed the thread and memory overflow issues in the V0.11.0 version. Can you create a new branch 0.11.1-SNAPSHOT for me to submit my code?
 The main issue is that the keepAlive in SecureChannel causes the channel to be occupied for a long time without being released.

I have updated PLC4X to version 0.12 which contains the commits for #1007. Unfortunately, the memory leak issue persists.

Does anyone have insights into the root cause of this problem? I am willing to investigate further.

I aim to use PLC4X exclusively as the source/sink library for all my data projects. For S7 and Modbus protocols, the performance and stability are satisfactory, if not for occasional connection interruptions but are handled by NiFi's timeout settings. However, the Out of Memory (OOM) issue with OPC UA is particularly problematic.

Kind regards,

I have hoped that changes we did before 0.11 and later 0.12 would help, but they didn't. Looking at the graph and also brief verification you did with S7 and Modbus it is clear that we have a memory (or other resource) leak within opc ua protocol logic itself.
One bug which I know is present is connection hanging when authentication token expires, the refresh of token results in no further traffic on the connection. It could be that we keep generating packets, but OPC server do not answer them leading to growth of heap and crash. The default lifetime I saw with some PLCs is somewhere between 1h15m-1h30m (75-90 minutes) which seem to match, but not exactly, graph you have. The first period in your last snapshot, from 13:30 to 14:00 seem stable, leak gets visible from 14:15. Second period is stable just from 16:15 to 16:30. It gets into troubles instantly after that, as the available reclaimed memory is smaller and smaller. 

I did collect some memory dumps with OPC UA simulator, however it did not reveal anything suspicious with few tags.
@christofe-lintermans-actemium can you share how many tags you poll and how subscriptions are divided? I will try to build a reproducer too.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa856N1V1/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It occurred when calling the close method on the PlcConnection, resulting in resources not being properly released.

PLC4X uses eclipse milo underlying for the OPCUA driver.

The documentation says that tags added via `addCyclicField(...)` will be polled in the specified time intervals. My expectation is to get subscription events each time these fields are getting polled, but apparently I don't get any. The other two types of subscriptions are working OK, however I don't see any difference between `addChangeOfStateField(...)` and `addEventField(...)` with the OPC-UA driver.

Example code to reproduce the issue:
```
PlcDriverManager driverManager = new PlcDriverManager();
try (PlcConnection opcuaConnection = driverManager.getConnection(""opcua:tcp://opcuaserver.com:48010"")) {
    PlcSubscriptionRequest request = opcuaConnection.subscriptionRequestBuilder()
            .addCyclicField(
                    ""Demo"",
                    ""ns=2;s=Demo.Static.Scalar.String"",
                    Duration.ofSeconds(1)
            )
            .build();

    PlcSubscriptionResponse response = request.execute().get();
    if (response.getResponseCode(""Demo"") != PlcResponseCode.OK) {
        throw new RuntimeException(""Not OK."");
    }

    AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();

    response.getSubscriptionHandle(""Demo"").register(
            subscriptionEvent -> {
                counter.incrementAndGet();
                System.out.println(subscriptionEvent);
            }
    );

    Thread.sleep(10 * 1000); // 10 seconds

    if (counter.get() == 0) {
        throw new RuntimeException(""No events received."");
    }
}

System.out.println(""OK"");

Currently the `ping()` method only seems to be implemented in `plc4j-driver-s7`. In all other drivers it throws an exception, when called.

Please implement it for all drivers, where this is technically possible, so the user application could rely on this standard interface to test if a connection is broken, or it could use it for keeping a connection alive without actually doing real traffic.

The OPC-UA driver supports (among others) password based authentication. Currently one can only configure this through URL query parameters, like so:

```
driverManager.getConnection(""opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:4567?username=foo&password=bar"")
```

There already is a facility in the framework to pass authentication object to the `getConnection(...)` call, so ideally the above should be equivalent to this one below:

```
driverManager.getConnection(
    ""opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:4567"",
    new PlcUsernamePasswordAuthentication(""foo"", ""bar"")
)
```

Looking at the code, this feature is currently only supported by `plc4j-driver-ads`, and other drivers silently ignore the passed object.

Adding support for this facility would improve the overall user experience.

This issue affects both `v0.10.0` and the pre-release `v0.11.0`, and also highlights a conceptual, architectural problem in the `plc4j` library in general, that applies to multiple drivers.

## Base problem

The OPC-UA driver starts a keepalive thread once a connection is successfully estabilished. One keepalive thread per connection, here: [SecureChannel.java:577](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/v0.11.0/plc4j/drivers/opcua/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/opcua/context/SecureChannel.java#L577). The keepalive loop itself is created in the common thread pool (via `supplyAsync()`), which is limited in size, and shared between the library and the user application: [SecureChannel.java:998](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/v0.11.0/plc4j/drivers/opcua/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/opcua/context/SecureChannel.java#L998). The exit condition of this loop is not defined, therefore it keeps running forever, and holds/blocks a thread in the common pool, even after the connection is closed. As the common pool is size limited (`nr_cpus - 1`), after a few iterations of connect/disconnect, the common pool gets exhausted, and it can no longer execute any new tasks. Neither from the plc4j library, nor from the user application. As `supplyAsync()` is also used for creating a subscription monitor loop, this means that loop never gets started, because of the keepalive threads: [OpcuaSubscriptionHandle.java:227](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/v0.11.0/plc4j/drivers/opcua/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/opcua/protocol/OpcuaSubscriptionHandle.java#L227). This practically means that the future object returned by `PlcSubscriptionRequest.execute()` never completes.

And let's assume for a moment, that the base problem above is fixed, and the keepalive thread now has a proper exit condition. In this case, the use of common pool will limit the count of ongoing subscriptions in the application, as each subscription thread occupies a slot in the pool. If the user has 4 CPU cores, this means they cannot have more than 2 active subscriptions: 1 slot is held by keepalive, 2 slots are held by the subscription threads.

## Conceptual problem

Thread pools are not for long running tasks. They are for frequent, ephemeral calculations, to save the cost of spawning a new thread every time. I think the current (ab)use of common pool should be either redesigned, to avoid hosting infinite loops, or these should be replaced by dedicated threads.

## Example application to reproduce the Base problem

```java
public class ForkJoinPoolDemo {

    public static final String FJP_PARALLELISM = ""java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism"";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        System.out.println(FJP_PARALLELISM + "": "" + System.getProperty(FJP_PARALLELISM));
        System.out.println(""CPU Core: "" + Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());

        printDetails();

        PlcDriverManager driverManager = new DefaultPlcDriverManager();
        PlcConnectionManager connectionManager = driverManager.getConnectionManager();

        for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
            Thread.sleep(1000);

            try (PlcConnection connection = connectionManager.getConnection(""opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:12686/milo"")) {
                printStats(format(""Iteration: %d, Place: Before Subscribe"", i));

                PlcSubscriptionRequest request = connection.subscriptionRequestBuilder()
                        .addChangeOfStateTag(""Demo"", OpcuaTag.of(""ns=2;s=HelloWorld/ScalarTypes/Integer""))
                        .build();

                PlcSubscriptionResponse response = request.execute().get(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
                if (response.getResponseCode(""Demo"") != PlcResponseCode.OK) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(""Not OK."");
                }

                printStats(format(""Iteration: %d, Place: Before Unsubscribe"", i));

                PlcUnsubscriptionRequest unsubscriptionRequest = connection.unsubscriptionRequestBuilder()
                        .addHandles(response.getSubscriptionHandles()).build();
                unsubscriptionRequest.execute();

                printStats(format(""Iteration: %d, Place: Before Close"", i));
            } finally {
                printStats(format(""Iteration: %d, Place: After Close"", i));

The program above locks up, and eventually exits with a timeout exception. I have made thread dump during the lockup period, and I have seen 11 common pool threads in `TIMED_WAIT`, with the following stack trace:

It is indeed a bug which will contribute to resource exhaustion. We can introduce dedicated thread (or two) for each OPC UA connection in order to bind these to connection lifecycle.
Your example uses 60s sampling window, could you share what were cycle times you used while tracing this issue? With 60s there is a lot of time for thread context switch even for fairly under-powered devices.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85opd_U/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Hi all,

I upgraded from version 0.9.1 to 0.11.0 and I cannot write to my Beckhoff PLC anymore.

When I write 1 to a DINT, 16777216 is stored.

Is it a BIG-ENDIAN vs LITTLE-ENDIAN issue ?
Is it possible to specify the “endianness” of the PLC ?

According to the TWINCat doc, it seems they use LITTLE-ENDIAN.

The PLC type is a ""CX8190 / Standard

Attached is 3 REALLY simple Java application.
Write ""1"" to a DINT and read it back.

First with version 0.9.1 -> WORKS
Second with version 0.10.0 -> DOESN'T WORK (same issue) Third with version 0.11.0 -> DOESN'T WORK (same issue)

I did upgrade our ""big"" project from 0.9.1 to 0.11.0 yesterday, so I did not notice the issue with 0.10.0... my bad on this.

Hope it can help, bring some light as what changed from 0.9.1 to 0.10.0 and 0.11.0

I will work on getting a Wireshark log during the day and will do more testing.

There was a change in how symbolic tags are handled, they got smarter from 0.8 release where, beyond symbol name, its type had to be specified.

Please check and/or adjust following code:
```
try (PlcConnection plcConnection = new DefaultPlcDriverManager().getConnection(connectionString)) {
    PlcBrowseResponse response = plcConnection.browseRequestBuilder().addQuery(""symbols"", """")
        .build().execute().get();
    for (PlcBrowseItem symbol : response.getValues(""symbols"")) {
        System.out.println(symbol.getName() + "" "" + symbol.getTag() + "" "" + symbol.getOptions());
    }
}
```

It should print you all tags which got detected when connection was established. I don't think any more that discovery is a problem, its rather question of type mapping and/or eventual encoding.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85pTG0Y/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

`writeBuilder.addTagAddress(""ValueDINT"", ""MAIN.ValeurDINT"", new PlcDINT(value)); `
Passing a ""new PlcXXX(value)"" write a value to the PLC, but not the good one as mentionned above. 
Example: writing 1 writes  16777216 with this syntax.

`writeBuilder.addTagAddress(""ValueDINT"", ""MAIN.ValeurDINT"", value); `
Passing a value without a ""PlcTYPE"" parameter, always writes null to the Plc

Checking the code in PlcValueHandler.java:

```
public static PlcValue of(PlcTag tag, Object[] values) {
if (values.length == 1) {
    Object value = values[0];
    if(tag.getPlcValueType() == null) {
    // TODO: This is a hacky shortcut ..
   if(value instanceof PlcValue) {
         return (PlcValue) value;
   }
   return new PlcNull();
}
```
Passing the ""new PlcDINT(value)"" is ""fixed"" by the ""hacky shortcut, mentionned in the comment of the code.
Its becausse:
the if (tag.getPlcValueType()... always return null

Hope it make senses. Let me know, if you need more infos / tests on this.

Hi Chris,
Attached is the WireShark results of my test. I ran the test twice,

Here is the Java code:
`       
        final DefaultPlcDriverManager driver = new DefaultPlcDriverManager();
        final PlcConnection plcConnection = driver.getConnection(""ads:tcp://10.10.11.77?sourceAmsNetId=172.29.48.1.1.1&sourceAmsPort=34&targetAmsNetId=5.62.206.200.1.1&targetAmsPort=851"");


        final Integer expectedValue = 1;

        // Write value to plc
        PlcWriteRequest.Builder writeBuilder = plcConnection.writeRequestBuilder();
        writeBuilder.addTagAddress(""ValueDINT"", ""MAIN.ValeurDINT"", new PlcDINT(expectedValue)); // With PLC4X 0.11.0, we need to pass a PlcXXX object, otherwise null is used ?

        PlcWriteRequest writeRequest = writeBuilder.build();
        writeRequest.execute().get();

        // Read the written value
        PlcReadRequest.Builder reaBuilder = plcConnection.readRequestBuilder();
        reaBuilder.addTagAddress(""ValueDINT"", ""MAIN.ValeurDINT"");

        PlcReadRequest readRequest = reaBuilder.build();
        PlcReadResponse response = readRequest.execute().get();

        Integer result = response.getInteger(""ValueDINT"");

        System.out.println(""Read value: "" + result.toString());
`

As you can see, I write 1 and read it back, and of course I expect 1 as the result, but I get :
Read value: 16777216

If you need anything else, pls let me know.

Due to some reasons, I didn't describe it clearly before. My concerns are as follows
Thread A:
```java
// step 1
PlcConnection con = cachedPlcConnectionManager.getConnection();
// step 2
PlcWriteRequest writeRequest = con.writeRequestBuilder().build();
// step 5
PlcWriteResponse writeResponse = writeRequest.execute().get();
``` 

Thread B:
```java
// step 3
PlcConnection con = cachedPlcConnectionManager.getConnection();
// step 4
con.close();
``` 
When executing step 5 the ""writer"" in method `execute()` actually is the old 'con' which closed by thread B in step 4, that will cause the write fail.
Maybe the method close() can wait other thread write finish or use the new connection to do write?

With Siemens PLCs, you can wait a monitoring time of about 6-8 seconds for it to consider the dropped connection (I have tested it on S7-300 and S7-400), so the traffic monitor is set to that time.

In short, you can disconnect the cable for 3 seconds and that method will return that you are connected.

HI,

I am testing the `CachedPlcConnectionManager` and I found a bug. 
I am using PLC Siemens S7 1200, I am testing the reliability of the communication between PLC4x and PLC in case of drop of the connection. This is quite important for me because the PLC is not always connected to the server I am using to query data to the PLC. 
The code I wrote to distribute the  `CachedPlcConnectionManager` is:
```java
    /**
     * Build up a new {@link CachedPlcConnectionManager}
     */
    private CachedPlcConnectionManager getNew() {

        CachedPlcConnectionManager cachedPlcConnectionManagerTemp = CachedPlcConnectionManager.getBuilder()
                                                                                              .withMaxLeaseTime(Duration.ofMillis(700))
                                                                                              .withMaxWaitTime(Duration.ofMillis(1000))
                                                                                              .build();
        log.warn(""New Driver Manager Found: {}"", cachedPlcConnectionManagerTemp);
        return cachedPlcConnectionManagerTemp;
    }
```
This method is used to get the connection in various part of my code in this way: 

```java
try (var plcConnection = cachedPlcConnectionManager.getConnection(plcConnectionString)) {
.... do stuff
}
```

Everything is fine since I don't plug the cable for testing the reliability, the errors are correctly trapped and handled but as soon as the connection is back I got this error: 

```java

```

Since that error all the request made to have a connection from the `CachedPlcConnectionManager` got stuck, never exit and my entire application is dead waiting forever a connection !!!! 

As you can see from the log the problem is inside the driver: 
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: HashedWheelTimer.stop() cannot be called from TimerTask
```
That's a very scary error !!!

What happen here?

Thanks,
S.

There is currently no specific plan in place. However, there was a previous discussion on the topic of the Java version, you may want to review it for additional insights.

Modbus unit id is part of every frame which is being exchanged through TCP / UDP or serial port. It means that this parameter is not needed for connection negotiation. It does not need to be set prior connection establishment. It might remain as a connection level default, for shortening tag definitions for basic applications.

Given that there are inverters which support multiple unit ids for different modbus register tables current way of managing unit identifier requires starting up multiple TCP (or even worse) - serial connections.

All serial-transport protocols can only have one connection using them and all RawSocket transports, as that currently get's an exclusive lock on the serial port. PROFINET would currently only allow talking to one device at a time as having multiple raw-socket channels doesn't seem to be possible. Same with BacNET, as this opens a listening UDP-Port of a fixed port number (I think). 

So we generally need to come up with a way to distinguish between exclusive transports (TCP, UDP without a fixed local port number) and shared transports (Serial, UDP with fixed local port number, Raw-Sockets).

As soon as that's solved, I think we should stick with the ""multiple connections"" approach, even for Modbus, as the alternative would be to add a device-id to every address. As I think ModbusTCP is the by far most used Modbus variant, I wouldn't want to add this to every modbus address.

After latest updates fixing issues with writing some datatypes and with reading/writing var-length STRING and WSTRING types, it seems that when reading TIME values in the Manual S7 Driver test, I'm getting timeouts when reading the TIME fields.

We would like to establish a connection to a S7 plc, tested it with the following plc types
 - S7 1500 (CPU 1515F-2 PN)
 - S7 315

A connection is established for a short time in which we can also read out data from the plc before a DisconnectEvent appears.

Has anyone ever had this problem ?
The connection to our plc works normally with the Moka7 library

I have tested connecting and reading with the current snapshot version again.
Reading values now works without an error :blush:

There is still a warning when establishing the connection. Also the function ""isConnected()"" of the interface ""PlcConnection"" sometimes returns true and sometimes false. However, this does not affect the reading process.

I've faced with a situation when scheduled earlier TriggeredScraperTask has completed after getting TimeoutException in execution of PlcReadRequest. The scenario is pull data from server every 50ms for kafka connector.

https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/8f914109bb6047af35dc909d3851273e17277b2e/plc4j/tools/scraper/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/scraper/triggeredscraper/TriggeredScraperTask.java#L126-L135

Changing code to 
```java
                    plcReadResponse = readRequestBuilder
                        .build()
                        .execute()
                        .orTimeout(requestTimeoutMs, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                        .get();
```
improves the situation. Read request still complete exceptionally and LeasedPlcConnection sets `invalidateConnection` flag so leased connection on close return connection to the connection container with request to invalidate cached connections.

This in turn cause completion of execution threads in TriggerScraperImpl and kafka source connector no longer retrieve information from server.

For some reason, if `Bootstrap.connect(...)` had failed for any reason, EventLoopGroup.shutdownGracefullly does not close channel and keeps `select`-ing it indefinitely, causing a lot of logs to appear

```
NioEventLoop -- Selector.select() returned prematurely 512 times in a row; rebuilding Selector org.apache.plc4x.java.transport.serial.SerialPollingSelector@5bb67f2.
NioEventLoop -- Migrated 1 channel(s) to the new Selector.

NioEventLoop -- Migrated 1 channel(s) to the new Selector.
```

There is a basic repro - it purposely tries to open non-existent serial port and fails: https://gist.github.com/zawodskoj/68987f535bbfe199eeee9be43cf4bf13

There is also a dirty workaround - it is possible to obtain SerialPollingSelector through reflection and invoke `close()` on them, catching meaningless NotImplementedException

```kotlin
val getJCh = AbstractNioChannel::class.java.getDeclaredMethod(""javaChannel"")
getJCh.isAccessible = true
val javach = getJCh.invoke(cch) as AbstractInterruptibleChannel
try {
    javach.close()
} catch (e: NotImplementedException) {
    // ???
}
```

Soon after another `rebuildSelector0()`, Netty attempts to re-register channel, fails to do so (because it is already closed) and exits the infinite loop

```

I'm using TriggeredScraperImpl to fetch data periodically. If any of tag failed, I cannot get the tag which is successful. 
The reason is here: https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/v0.11.0/plc4j/tools/scraper/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/scraper/triggeredscraper/TriggeredScraperImpl.java

```

        return plcReadResponse.getTagNames().stream()
            .collect(Collectors.toMap(

                plcReadResponse::getObject
            ));
    }
```

Should check all tags are successful before calling plcReadResponse::getObject, or it will throw exception below:

### Isseu
When executing a read request every second in an ethernal loop 
After 1 hour and 15 minutes the connection is not funktioning anymore when executing a read request every second in an ethernal loop.

`readRequest.execute().get()`

When adding a timeout off 1000 ms to the get statement a exception is thrown.
After this the connection has to be terminated and restarted in order to contineu reading data from the OPC UA Server.

`2024-01-18 16:35:30,658 ERROR [org.apa.plc.jav.opc.pro.OpcuaSubscriptionHandle] (pool-10-thread-1) Timeout while waiting for subscription response: java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException

Can you please try running locally built PR #1007? I believe it might greatly improve stability of opcua driver due to changes to thread management. Two days ago I've got a thumbs up about this PR working fine with secured S7-1200, making a two hour test with S7-1500 is something we can't do (I don't owe such hardware).
The PR itself is about to be merged, but knowing how it works with your case will let me prioritize work on eventual bug fixes (if they still needed).

The last message marks a moment when subscription stopped to work. This part was touched with UA security updates, however scope of changes in this area was fairly limited.

When trying to read a system time of the data type DATE_AND_TIME from our S7-300 controllers, we receive the following exception:
""java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.plc4x.java.api.exceptions.PlcRuntimeException: Unable to decode Response""

My findings so far:

1. Via another program we query the value with the data type DATE_AND_TIME and get ""2024-01-14 22:59:57,685"".
2. When querying the system time via your adapter with the data type LTIME, I get the following value: ""PT720664H32M27.487843954S"". This value seems to me to be an IEC timer that has been running since the beginning of the Epoch timestamp (Thu Jan 01 1970 00:00:01 GMT+0000).

The fix for the DATE_AND_TIME type is in the following branch

fix/DATE_AND_TIME

I have carried out the tests on an S7-400 and it can read and write correctly.
It would be necessary to verify the writing of the msec.
The modification should not affect any other application, if someone can do a check before pushing the modification to the ""develop"" branch.

In order to work around this issue and protocol constraints we’ve put some logic on top of the PLC4X library to allow custom handling for specific datatypes and size of values that go beyond the max pdu of the used controller.

The correct representation should be:

**DT001 : 1994-01-01T00:17:54.032000000
DT002 : 2024-02-10T10:59:16.223000000**

I think that in this case the call to the help function that corrects this problem applies.

I'll do the test and confirm.

Arie here from AWS. Feel free to let me know if you want a quick online meeting in which I can explain which (and why) workarounds and optimizations we have implemented on top of PLC4X in our S7 adapter.

Subject: Re: [apache/plc4x] [Bug]: Unable to decode Datatype DATE_AND_TIME on S7-300 (Issue #1366)


So are there any other issues still open, that you need to work around? Because, if there are, this would be valuable feedback to us ... and if you know how to support other datatypes, this could be an interesting case for PLC4X to support directly.

But in all cases, if this issue is now solve, I'd like to close the issue and possibly create new ones for other problems.

With the latest modification you can read/write date and time types without problem. Final nanosecond presentation was corrected.

I have been able to verify the types ALARM_8 and ALARM_8P, whose timestamp depends on this modification, and they work fine.

It remains to be tested with an S7-300, but I think we can definitely consider closing this point.

There is an unnecessary Thread.sleep in the EipProtocolLogic, which makes the protocol driver unusably slow.

To me it looks like leftover debug code or similar, at least there is no obvious reason to me for it being there.

The API contains a type `EventPlcConnection`  which is an inteface that doesn't quite align with the rest of the API.

I think we should possibly have a more detailed look at this.

1) User application has no ways to determine state of connection, we internally process connected/disconnected events, but user never actually knows if connection was terminated by remote until it gets an error. Getting a `ConnectionListener` allows to track lifecycle of connection and act accordingly.
2) There is no way to simplify track low level traffic other than tapping a wireshark, which can be troublesome under production environments. Possibility to attach `MessageExchangeListener` provides interception point for user application to get messages in raw form.

That's whole motivation of it. Given that our API didn't have above concepts they were built as a supplement with this extra interface.

While releasing I noticed that the code generator in the UI tool outputs the fields of one type in different order, wen running on MAC or in Linux, we should therefore ensure this plugin is also only run when we're explicitly updating the generated code.

            PlcWriteRequest writeRequest = plcConnection.writeRequestBuilder()
                                                        .addTagAddress(""ValX"", ""MAIN.ValX"", new PlcDINT(154))

                                                        .build();

            PlcWriteResponse writeResponse = writeRequest.execute().get(); 
```

Error decoding TCP package after N read requests.
## Example code causing the bug
### Description
-  I get an error both on the real device and on the [Modbus Slave Simulator](https://www.modbusdriver.com/diagslave.html) running with option `-m enc`
- I **always** get it at the **20th** iteration of the loop presented in the code example
- There is no error if you execute only one request per loop iteration (comment out the second request)
- There are also no errors in `modbus-tcp` mode
- There is also no error if both the first and second commands request the same number of registers

When I try to connect Modbus and read data from address with a slave id like 22, I cannot find the slave id configuration in the plc4j-driver-modbus library. 

I get a little confused, because other's lib like modbus4j has this feature.


Without slave id, it looks always reading from a default slave-id, like 1 which does not exist, then it will cause timeout exception:

Hello Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek assistance regarding an issue I encountered while using PLC4X version 0.12.0. Following the examples provided on the official website, I attempted to read the address %I0.2:BOOL. However, I encountered an error. Could you please advise on the possible reasons for this error?

Here is the code:
package com.yxp;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class plc {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(plc.class);


    private static void read() {
        String connectionString = ""s7://192.168.1.181"";

        try (PlcConnection plcConnection = PlcDriverManager.getDefault().getConnectionManager().getConnection(connectionString)) {

            // Check if this connection support reading of data.
            if (!plcConnection.getMetadata().isReadSupported()) {
                logger.error(""This connection doesn't support reading."");
                return;
            }



            // Create a new read request:
// - Give the single item requested an alias name
            PlcReadRequest.Builder builder = plcConnection.readRequestBuilder();

            builder.addTagAddress(""value1"",""%I0.2:BOOL"");

            PlcReadRequest readRequest = builder.build();
            PlcReadResponse response  = readRequest.execute().get(5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
            System.out.println( response.getTagNames()+""---""+response.getResponseCode(response.getTagNames().toString()));

        }catch (Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();

When I try to get the value from one Modbus address, the program will be blocked.

code:
            PlcReadRequest.Builder plcBuilder = plcConn.readRequestBuilder();
            plcBuilder.addTagAddress(point.getId(), tagAddress);
            PlcReadRequest request = plcBuilder.build();
            PlcReadResponse response = request.execute().get();
            LOGGER.debug(""Get response"");

the log will never print out.

1. This issue will happen after running the program for a long time, maybe after one hour.
2. I use new DefaultPlcDriverManager().getConnection(serverUrl); to create modus connection.
3. I create multiple connection instances for the same Modbus server with different slaveId (more than 10) for different value readers.

Is there anyway to set read timeout?

Recently introduced tag config concept allows to specify tag config options which form a map. It can be used to distinguish nodes in bus systems and would fit perfectly for `node-id` which is currently embedded in CANopen tags.

There is no rush to get these issues sorted out, specially the connection issue that I have mentionned and which seems to be also an issue in v.0.12.0  as stated in the link provided above. I am promoting plc4j as a multi-protocol gateway in our company and we want to succeed witht this project. OPC UA connectivity is a must given that most of our third party machine providers use this protocol.

I had a response from Lukasz from the development team and apparently there might be a clue for the problem I am facing. As per Lukasz statement, ""Also note that http transport/xml encoding is unsupported. We cover only binary marshaling"".

To throw some context in above issue - I've found cause for missing subscriptions, however I've also found a lower level issue related to renewing of OPC-UA security token which I couldn't fix yet.

sir， That means the IP in the URL must be that of the PLC. Otherwise, if the IP can be pinged but is not that of a PLC, the connection program will not stop.

Hi,

Thanks again for this great piece of software. I hope that you can develop the IEC-61850 protocol which is an electrical utility protocol used in substations and IEDs (Intelligent Equipment Devices). This protocol is often used in renewable power plants even at machine level for data exchange. The GOOSE message feature allows fast tripping and is also used for control purposes.

I believe that if PLC4X implements this protocol, it will serve plenty of applications mainly in the energy sector.

Regards,
Alexis

Unfortunately there is plenty of interest in us implementing all sorts of protocol adapters, however the willingness to acknowledge and reward our activies, which usually happen during our free time, is almost not existent.

I even tried crowdfunding development efforts, but that too didn't get a single initiative to get even one Euro in support.

So personally, I'd be happy wo work on something like that ... but I won't do it for free in my free time and even spend money for purchassing specs and equipment.

The PLC I'm developing against has a symbol of type List that contains a list of Structs, which aren't exposed as their own symbols (at least not included in the browse results when retrieving ""symbols""). Reading the current value from the symbol produces the correct List of Struct results, but when I try to write an updated value back to it, the driver resolves it to an empty byte[]. This seems to be happening within `AdsProtocolLogic.serializeInternal()`, when iterating the list entries it determines each entry to be a list as well, since the same dataType is used for the child iteration as well, and the `DataItem.staticSerialize()` can't handle that.

The OPC-UA endpoint discovery is important to get a working connection towards UA server, however its current implementation already lead to multiple issues and contributed to overall stability of the driver.

Main problem with UA discovery is visible only at the lower level if option `discover' is set to 'true`. In such case we create a pre-flight TCP connection to obtain endpoint string and server certificate which we can use to launch desired connection. To my present knowledge, this is the only one reason we have that. In order to achieve above case we made adjustments with plc4j-spi as well as driver context (mutable) vs driver configuration (immutable).

I believe that sorting this puzzle before 1.0 would greatly simplify maintenance of driver and spi, cause current way requires close care of both places. Switching this code to `PlcDiscoverer` sounds like a much viable and reliable alternative. We already have working implementations of this SPI in ads and profinet drivers.

In order to write tags using ads Driver, in 0.12.0 I need to specify the ""PlcType"" in the ""addTagAddress"" method like this:

PlcWriteRequest writeRequest = plcConnection.writeRequestBuilder()
                                                         .addTagAddress(""ValX"", ""MAIN.ValX"", new PlcDINT(154))  <= NEED to pass a PlcDINT
                                                        .build();
If I dont, I get an error.

On the other hand, with OPCUA driver for example, doing the same thing, results in an error:

Exception in thread ""main"" org.apache.plc4x.java.api.exceptions.PlcRuntimeException: Expected PlcValue of type NULL but got INT

In this case doing:
PlcWriteRequest writeRequest = plcConnection.writeRequestBuilder()
                                                         .addTagAddress(""ValX"", ""MAIN.ValX"", 154)  <= MUST NOT SPECIFY a PlcType
                                                        .build();

it works.

So it seems there's some inconsistencies between drivers.

I think requiring PlcValue is fine. That's what I use with 0.9.1.
It's just that right now, in 0.12.0, not all the drivers do so.

Best example, is the OPCUA one, which you cannot pass PLCValue. It throws an exception like:
Exception in thread ""main"" org.apache.plc4x.java.api.exceptions.PlcRuntimeException: Expected PlcValue of type NULL but got INT

In my use case, I can connect to any type of PLC (supported by PLC4X) via a configuration from a .yaml file.
We connect to PLC ""x"", get the data and push it on different platformms (RabbitMQ, MQTT, Kafka, SignalR,...) depending on the needs.

As of now, I can have a workaround using a ""switch statement"" on the ""driver"" and using the addTagAdress() method appropriatly, but it just feels inconsistent and ""harder"" for newcomers.

Just my 0.2 cents on the subject :)

As always, I really appreciate all the works you guys do on the project. 
I love PLC4X and just wish the best for it.

I have tried it, and it works properly when the data type is explicitly defined in the tagAddress. Here is my screenshot. In theory, other protocols can also be used in the same way.

Agree, we should indeed guarantee that handling of arguments passed by caller keep basic API contract. Currently due to tag syntax we can in theory assume some stuff for UA.

I'll keep this issue on my radar.

hi:
   PlcReadRequest excute.get() blocked when i connected to a modbus slave simulator software.
   I found that there is no packets got by wireshark, only the tcp handshake packet.
```
 try{
            	logger.info(""Read to modbus"");
            	PlcReadRequest.Builder mBuilder = mPlcConnection.readRequestBuilder();

            	mBuilder.addTagAddress(""coil-2"", ""coil:2:BOOL"");
                PlcReadRequest mReadRequest = mBuilder.build();
                PlcReadResponse syncResponse = mReadRequest.execute().get();

If you want us to help you, I think we need a bit more information:
- What type of simulator are you using?
- What's the rest of the code (especially the connection string)?
- Set the log level to TRACE and what does it output?

But you state that nothing is going out ... well ... it might be that your classpath just completely breaks PLC4J because the Modbus drivers would generally always send something out.

I found that if I create the project as a Maven project through Eclipse and modify the dependency of pom.xml, it can be compiled and run normally.

As the grid operators are moving towards digitalization, it would be nice to introduce this protocol in the module, to enable scenarios like:
61850 standardization (grid 2 grid messagging)
61850 transformation to MQTT (to gather all devices measurements in a central broker)

In Java we detect if libpcap is installed and if it's not, we skip the pcap related tests.
In PLC4Go the build fails, if no libpcap is installed on the system:

```
[INFO] === Failed
[INFO] === FAIL: spi/transports/pcap TestTransportInstance_Connect/connect_with_file (0.00s)
[INFO]     TransportInstance_test.go:163: Connect() error = couldn't load wpcap.dll, wantErr false
[INFO]     --- FAIL: TestTransportInstance_Connect/connect_with_file (0.00s)

```

NOTE: Currently it seems impossible to install WinPCAP on Windows systems with Aarch64 architecture. But I found that we now need to install NPcap, which is available for Windows Aarch64

When I tried to read some nodes multiple times, the issue of too many sessions occurred.
I'm wondering if there is a configuration file that I can set some values to limit the max session I need?

Can you share some more information - how do you scrap PLC, how long it does take to get this error, and how many threads you use in your application?

The OPCUA SERVER limits the number of connection sessions, so make sure you haven't established too many connections. You also need to check the OPCUA SERVER's limitations regarding connections.

The PlcConnection is not working propertly in my setup for S7 PLC. Maybe it is related to Issue 1257.


My test code (the test is not successful).
```
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import org.apache.plc4x.java.DefaultPlcDriverManager;
import org.apache.plc4x.java.api.PlcConnection;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class BasicConnectionTest {

  @Test
  void testConnection() throws Exception {
    String url = ""s7://127.0.0.1:102?remote-rack=0&remote-slot=1"";
    PlcConnection plcConnection = new DefaultPlcDriverManager().getConnectionManager().getConnection(url);
    assertThat(plcConnection.isConnected()).isTrue();
    plcConnection.close();
  }
}
```
Apart from that, some requests seem to work properly when the connection is used afterwards.

If I try to debug then I run into a timeout but there is also NullPointerException. But I think that is something else and maybe not important.

If it is an S7-300, it should be String url = ""s7://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.:102?remote-rack=0&remote-slot=2"";
If it is an S7-400,  String url = ""s7://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:102?remote-rack=0&remote-slot=3"";

So, Are you  using NetToPLCSim or something similar? I say it because of the IP address is a local PC.

thank you for looking into the problem and responding. 

We have three real S7 PLCs in our test lab:: S7-1200, S7-1515, S7-1516
For testing purposes, I connect to the PLC via an SSH tunnel, but I also run the code without an SSH connection next to the PLC. I have improved my code and logging a little bit to show you more details. I have tried out the connection with all three SPS via SSH and next to the SPS on a remote computer. Everything runs perfectly in version 0.11.0 but if I change the version to 0.12.0 the exception occurs as described before. You can find more details in the log output below. 

Here is my current test code:
```

Log output with version 0.11.0 => works and looks good

you are right it is possible to perform read requests with the connection. I have not tested other operations but [mrwhy-orig](https://github.com/mrwhy-orig) commented that it is possible. I also mentioned in the issue description that the connection requests seem to work.

> Apart from that, some requests seem to work properly when the connection is used afterwards.

My problem is that when I call plcConnection.isConnected() it is always false in version 0.12.0.
This already affects my current implementation as I check the connection before a new request is executed. If the PLC connection is diconnected, I try to re-establish the connection.

I'm not sure about following log but it says that more then one exception was raised.
```
[nioEventLoopGroup-4-1] WARN i.n.channel.embedded.EmbeddedChannel - More than one exception was raised. Will report only the first one and log others.
io.netty.handler.codec.DecoderException: io.netty.handler.codec.EncoderException: MessageToMessageCodec$1 must produce at least one message.
```

The second problem is the log: I have tried to change the log level of PLC4X and netty to ERROR but the DEBUGDOOM stuff is still present in the log. 

It seems that in my case there is no good workaround with version 0.12.0.

So maybe you just need to completely remove the isConnected method in S7HPlcConnection?

Apart from the isConnected method, I would say that the WARN and DEBUGDOOM logging from the nioEventLoopGroup process is still problematic. It seems to work, but it messes up all the logging and important messages can get lost.

I have tested my sample code with version 0.13.0-SNAPSHOT (0.13.0-20240531.145431-1). Still the same behavior: isConnected is false after the connection has been established and the DEBUGDOOM and WARN log is still present.
Was there a related commit? 
I have tried out to remove the isConnected method in the S7HPlcConnection class and then the connection status is ""true"". But not sure why this stuff is required (introduced in version 0.12.0 with #1214):
```
  @Override
  public boolean isConnected() {
    return channel.attr(S7HMuxImpl.IS_CONNECTED).get();
  }

And it turns out I just didn't see the error with my test-cases, as I configured the logging to only report errors and this was a warning. As soon as I reduced the log-level to ""warn"" I could also see the error message.

It seems in S7HMuxImpl.encode when sending the second package (The S7 Setup Communication Request), the method bypasses the Netty pipeline and directly sends out the packet via the tcp-channel ... so the surrounding channel thinks there's nothing going out and logs a message.

I don't think that writing something to the output in a method called ""encode"" is a good choice.

I think this part of the driver would probably need a major refactoring. One that's currently out of scope for me, as I simply don't have enough time to work on.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86DCw1E/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We understand it might be a limitation for some users.

PLC4X intentionally dropped Java 8 support to streamline development for our contributors and leverage newer features that improve the codebase's maintainability. You can see the dicussion here: [Which is the minimal Java version plc4j should support](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/discussions/1059). We did not even conisder Java 8 anymore.

Upgrading to Java 11 (LTS) or later is highly recommended for full functionality and access to the latest features.

Unfortunately, backporting PLC4X to Java 8 currently isn't feasible due to resource limitations. The community would be happy to consider backporting efforts if additional resources become available, such as a developer resource (working regulary on supporting Java 8) or sponsored development.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa85-C8iI/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We have a Rockwell function block that is offering the following variables, that we want to read out.

The following request with two variables showed that only one of them is working - the other caused INTERNAL_ERROR responses from the Rockwell PLC. 

      readRequestBuilder = plcConnection.readRequestBuilder();
      readRequestBuilder.addTagAddress(""v1"", ""xxx1.timestamp_xxxxxxx_OFF"");   // ok - working
      readRequestBuilder.addTagAddress(""v2"", ""xxx1.timestamp_xxxxxxx_ON""); // INTERNAL_ERROR

We have had a look at the CIP packages on network level and it looks like the size of the second path segment was wrongly calculated - the following part of the CIP with slot/address are not recognized as a valid part of CIP protocol in wireshark (screenshot attached). 

For testing we renamed the last variable by adding an additional character at the end (in the FB and in the java code) e.g. xxx1.timestamp_xxxxxxx_ONN then everything worked fine. We have this situations with other variables as well (8 variables in our test - only half of them (the once with an even character count) are working - the others result in INTERNAL_ERRORs)

We have been able to fix the problem by changing org.apache.plc4x.java.eip.base.protocol.EipProtocolLogic.class in line 692 to:
 newSegment = new DataSegment(new AnsiExtendedSymbolSegment(identifier, (identifier.length() % 2 == 0) ? null : (short) 0));
More or less copy & paste from line 696/697.

From our point of view this is a bug in the path segment length calculation only affecting path variables with an odd character count (or second path segments with an odd character count).

Tested on a Rockwell 1769-L18ER/B LOGIX5318ER.

In S7ProtocolLogic the implementation of ""isConnected"" is as follows:

```

However the IS_CONNECTED constant never seems to be set, therefore the connection never appears to be connected.

modbus rtu over serial port will not work correct because the serial may be not write all data to the pc(or memory?), due to this, if read serial port immediately after send command, the data just read may be incomplete, so modbus driver will throw some errors like crc or read error.

modbus over serial port(com) could not closed successfully, try to call PlcConnection.close() when com disconnect, it will be in an endless loop. the major reason is that it will call channel close by netty automatically when shutdown NioEventLoop, and serial channel will put an doClose in eventLoop, it will call close again because eventLoopUp is not empty, and than, trapped in a dead cycle...
temp solution:
close method should only support call once.

I wanted to work on a fix, but the SerialChannel implementation seems really hacky without much information / comments and thus really difficult to work on:
- Why close method from AbstractChannel.AbstractUnsafe is overriden and completely by-passed as it deals with the specific issue (variable closeInitiated)
- Why unsafe() returns a new instance each time (a new instance is recreated at each read). Other implementations do not do that and only newUnsafe() is overriden. As newUnsafe() is not overriden, there is a rogue NioByteUnsafe that lies around.
- Why SerialNioUnsafe.read() implementation is very similar (but a bit different) to the one from NioByteUnsafe.

Content:
I have encountered an issue while using the plc4j-driver-bacnet (version 0.12.0). Upon creating a connection, I received the following error message: ""Active connections not yet supported."" Upon inspecting the source code, I discovered that the issue stems from the protocol being set to passive=false. Further investigation revealed that none of the supported transports (udp, tcp) are returning true, indicating that they do not support active connections. Additionally, when attempting to use the 'pcap' transport, I received the error message ""Unsupported transport pcap,"" which has left me confused.

Here is the relevant code snippet:

java
String connectionString = ""bacnet-ip:pcap://127.0.0.1:47808"";
PlcConnection plcConnection = PlcDriverManager.getDefault().getConnectionManager().getConnection(connectionString);

I can confirm that the address used in the connection string is valid, as I have successfully implemented BACnet using bacnet4j. Currently, I have utilized plc4j to implement the modbus and knx protocols without issues, but encountered this problem while implementing the BACnet protocol. I would greatly appreciate any assistance in resolving this matter. Thank you.

Active communication in Java has never been implemented.
The beginning of the bacnet driver was a paid gig, where I had to build a driver to passively observe a bacnet network.

Sebastian worked hard on an active version in go. Not quite sure about the state there.

Right now I have no plans to do the implementation of an active bacnet driver in Java.

Perhaps others can help here or you want to get your fingers dirty :-)

I think the heavy lifting of defining all the types is done and finished.

I assume this is the symbol table (As that's read first) it seems that it doesn't even come to the data-type-table. I don't think that a new issue is required, as indeed we need to be able to dynamically resolve tags. 

However the problem, is that the ADS driver has already become quite complex and my attempt to refactor it over the last week, was super complex. Here I tried to make the AdsTagHandler correctly resolve Ads Tags using the data in the symbol- and data-type-table. These changes already resulted in very complex refactoring. 

I therefore started implementing a new ADS driver, that will use a different approach ... one that would fix my problem and automatically also this issue ... however, as stated in my recent blog post (https://github.com/chrisdutz/blog/blob/main/plc4x/throwing-the-towel.adoc) ...

I was stuck in pre-conference work and just noticed that you had asked.

So I got some additional information and it seems as if the maximum size of a request read from an ADS device is considered to be  16384 bytes. This is not defined in the spec itself, but seems to be used throughout multiple implementations. 
So my guess might have been correct, that we need to chunk large symbol- and data-type-tables.

I am actually currently working on a new implementation of the ADS driver, which is greatly reworked, supports this chunking and which should also support lazy resolution of types (so no need to load the entire tables on startup)

However, will this driver most probably not become part of the open-source project too soon. If you are still considering using PLC4X you should probably ping me directly and I could tell you how we could reach an agreement.

I did some digging. Turns out the Beckhoff in production doesn't returns « basic types » (UDINT, USINT, REAL, BOOL, and more) in the dataTypeTable (ReservedIndexGroups.ADSIGRP_DATA_TYPE_TABLE_UPLOAD).
« java.lang.NullPointerException » is the result of not finding « UDINT » when doing `SymbolicAdsTag(""TwinCAT_SystemInfoVarList._AppInfo.OnlineChangeCnt"", org.apache.plc4x.java.api.types.PlcValueType.UDINT`

Doesn't seems to hit a size limit. Received everything declared in adsTableSizes.
symbolCount: 1640, symbolLength: 226832, dataTypeCount: 213, dataTypeLength: 175744, extraCount: 2000, extraLength: 11

I would appreciate if anyone has idea why those types are missing.

In preliminary test, adding them manually works. Could it break something?
Will continue testing and adding other types during the day.

There were a couple of issues, one being that the driver requested some newer fields that only TwinCat3 supports when doing the initial connection, and another being that TwinCat2 devices don't return the base data types. I solved these by adding a version check during the initial connection to skip the newer parameters if connecting to a TwinCat2 device, and side loading the base data types in to the data type table based on type definitions I copied from a TwinCat3 result table.

Yeah, depending on how many fields of AdsDataTypeTableEntry are truly used/important, should be not too hard to generate them.

Would require some work to parse missing arrays, such as « ARRAY [1..13] OF WORD ».

STRING, size is +1. But for some reason, « rest » has one less byte at STRING(10) compare to 7.

STRING(7)

        ManualEipLogixDriverTest test = new ManualEipLogixDriverTest(""logix://192.168.23.40"");

However I can see the UDT being correctly sent on the wire using WireShark, just it seems that decoding it is a problem for the driver. Also can't I write.

However, currently, the eip driver lacks stability, so we have to abandon this idea. During the initial testing, we also encountered the following error, as shown in the figure below. Hoping it will be helpful for you to improve the driver.

Also do I notice, that you seem to be opening and closing the connection every few seconds. Have you thought of using the ConnectionCache? This should dramatically reduce the speed of the connection. 

I'd really love to iron this out on Little-Endian devices, but as I mentioned before, it's super tricky and takes a lot longer to do so. I can see in the decoding that the code for parsing and serializing booleans probably doesn't work as expected for Little-Endian systems also do I think parsing a float BE and then rearranging the bytes is the wrong order when writing. 

It would probably be super easy to test with a real device, but without I will have to give up as it would be unfair for the other folks who are also waiting in this wall of issues that has been growing over the last few weeks.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86GSeIj/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The modbus spec seems to provide limits for the size of packets. However in contrast to the other protocols, is this limit not related to the size of the packet, but by the number of registers/coils. 

Please refer to: https://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b3.pdf, page: 11

It should be simple to implement a query-optimizer for Modbus to automatically handle this. The Siemens S7 QueryOptimizer might help with inspiration.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1675,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1675,plc4x,2364408990,1675,[Bug][EIP/LOGIX]: CIP service is not supported When connect to Allen Bradley PLC,acfly,24887154,,,CLOSED,2024-06-20T13:08:32Z,2024-08-16T11:30:01Z,"### What happened?

I need to read multiple tags from ControlLogix 1756-L71, for example 1000 tags,  and I found it quite slow, so i debug into the driver source code,  and it appears that the 247th line in `EipProtocolLogic.java` always trigged.
```java
if ((long) response.getStatus() == CIPStatus.ServiceNotSupported.getValue()) {
                    context.fireConnected();   // 247th line
                    return;
                } else if ((long) response.getStatus() != CIPStatus.Success.getValue()) {
                    throw new PlcRuntimeException(""Got status code while polling for supported CIP attributes ["" + response.getStatus() + ""]"");
                }
                if (response.getAttributes() != null) {
                    for (Integer classId : response.getAttributes().getClassId()) {
                        if (CIPClassID.enumForValue(classId) == CIPClassID.MessageRouter) {
                            this.useMessageRouter = true;     // never run
                        }
                        if (CIPClassID.enumForValue(classId) == CIPClassID.ConnectionManager) {
                            this.useConnectionManager = true;   // nerver run
                        }
                    }
                }
```
which means the CIP service is not supported,  and the 665th line in the same file will always be trigged,
```java
    public CompletableFuture<PlcReadResponse> read(PlcReadRequest readRequest) {
        CompletableFuture<PlcReadResponse> future;
        if (!this.useMessageRouter && !this.useConnectionManager) {
            future = readWithoutMessageRouter(readRequest);       # 665th line,  read tag one by one 
        } else if (this.useMessageRouter && !this.useConnectionManager) {
            future = readWithoutConnectionManager(readRequest);  # never run, read tags at one request, high efficient
        } else {
            future = readWithConnectionManager(readRequest);     # never run,  read tags at one request, high efficient
        }
        return future;
    }
```
the method `readWithoutMessageRouter` reads tags one by one, which cause significant decrease in efficiency. the method `readWithoutConnectionManager` and `readWithConnectionManager` are reading tags at one request, but they will never be triggered.

there is a similar bug reported and the author gives a solution. [Unable to Read from Allen-Bradley 1756-L73 A ControlLogix PLC](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag/issues/437#issue-1904212613)

So I guess the probably simplest solution would be adding a config option to the protocol, telling the driver to use the older forward_open messages (which might also require automatic splitting of requests into multiple messages if too many are requested)

This is a feature, that I will most probably not be able to tackle with the 4h per week that I have. If I would this would be consuming all of my available time for many weeks. Perhaps someone here will be able to help.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86CxoV3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I'd like to make a reproducer of this issue. Without it, it might be quite hard to spot cause and solve it. Since issue happens in encryption handler, very likely we calculate wrong size of payload and allocate too small buffer.
Earlier on I made tests with certificates having keys composed of 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096 and 5120 bytes. How long is key in server certificate you use?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86DxI34/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The client certificate and truststore are generated using OpenSSL, like this:
```
req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout clientkey.pem -out clientcert.der -days 3652
pkcs12 -export -in clientcert.der -inkey clientkey.pem -out store.pfx
```
I set the password to ""admin"" for both the private key and the truststore.
The OPC server exposes both Basic128Rsa15 and Basic256. Both gives the same error.

`Cannot invoke ""org.apache.plc4x.java.opcua.readwrite.PascalByteString.getLengthInBits()"" because ""this.receiverCertificateThumbprint"" is null`
I first tested connecting with the certificate through OPCUA to Prosys OPCUA Simu server, which worked. When testing with plc4j, this error keep on popping. I created the keystore .p12 based on the working certificate. 
When connecting as anonymous or with User and Password, it works fine.
`try (PlcConnection plcConnection = driverManager.getConnection(""opcua:tcp://Turing.lab.mtu-digilab.io:53530/OPCUA?"" +

I'm a bit unexperienced with OPCUA and certificates.

@fernandokendy Your seed files look fine, but if you disable discovery (discovery=false) then you must provide `server-certificate-file` parameter.

It was in fact an error in the backplane indexing. However there is another problem (the actual problem), when updating `0.11.0` to `0.12.0`. I will investigate that myself and hopefully found out what is going wrong. (if not I will create an own issue). 
Regarding the emulators, unfortunately i can not suggest one, we test against a real device. Thank you for ur help anyway and sorry for the confusion.

The syntax for writing values differs from driver to driver. Sometimes a primitiv is needed see #1523 otherwise an error is thrown, sometimes a PlcValue Object is needed (ADS) but if not provided no error is thrown, and sometimes primitives and PlcValue objects work (S7).

We should unify this.

On other hand in many cases we also miss a way to determine what encoding we should use for a tag. To make matter worse, drivers deal with situation where plc4j type (int) can be mapped to several plc types (sint, uint, dint).

From API point of view I believe we could guarantee consistency only when caller provides instance of `PlcValue`. Wrapper type clearly specifies data type intended by caller, and can be used by driver to assume wire encoding.
For other cases we can just try to unify logic through construction of `PlcValue` in single place. Currently I have impression that our spit `PlcValues.of` might miss some cases causing to failures.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86HaPKE/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Initially we only had the option to add the simple values. But this caused problems, because the driver had no way to see the real type it should send to the PLC. 

We were seeing that for example people passed in an ""integer"", which would be converted to an DINT and when sending a DINT to a field that's an USINT, this causes issues. Also when writing a UDT or an array, we can't pass in a primitives, but we need to pass in PlcList or PlcStruct objects. 

In general we would have 2 options:
- Extend every address string with the type at the end
- Require the user to pass in PlcValues of the expected type

I'm personally leaning more towards the fully qualified address option ... however, as mentioned this fails for structs (For arrays we could find a way around it).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86HeUTf/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The `pingAddress` attribute of `ModbusRtuProtocolLogic` seems to have never been assigned, which is different from `ModbusTcpProtocolLogic`.

Furthermore, its `ModbusRtuProtocolLogic.ping()` and `ModbusRtuDriver.canPing()` are both overridden, so I think this is unexpected.

Any send operation which expects response can specify criteria for matching answers but also error handlers which should be called when handling logic fails. Determination when error handler should be called is not trivial. Most of protocols have fairly long `unwrap`/`check` statements which can fail at any stage. We can not assume which stage will fail, we can't layer error handlers, thus we need carefully craft logic and make sure that we don't catch too much and still propagate failures to driver and clean up handlers.
Currently it might be that packet consumers are retained until timeout, even if we know that they can't properly handle incoming data.

I'm experiencing an issue where a **secure channel is not reestablished after reaching channel lifetime limit** while using PLC4Xj with certificates for both the client and server. The initial connection works perfectly, with a secure channel being established and data being received via OPC UA. However, once the channel's lifetime expires, it closes and is not automatically reestablished.

I've read that simply increasing the channel lifetime indefinitely is not a viable solution. I also attempted to use `tcp.keep-alive=true`, but this did not resolve the issue.

Is there a solution or configuration that I might be overlooking to address this problem?

---

### Additional Information:
Here is the connection string I'm using:

```java
String username = ""admin"";
String password = ""admin"";
String securityPolicy = ""Basic256Sha256"";
String keyStoreFile = ""/home/digilab/help/test2/demo_2/test/client/client_cert.p12"";
String serverCertificate = ""/home/digilab/help/test2/demo_2/test/SimulationServer@Yoshi_2048.der"";
String keyStorePassword = ""gustavo"";
String messageSecurity = ""SIGN_ENCRYPT"";

String connectionString = String.format(""opcua:tcp://Yoshi.lab.mtu-digilab.io:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer?discovery=false"");

connectionString += (username.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&username=%s"", username);
connectionString += (password.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&password=%s"", password);
connectionString += (securityPolicy.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&security-policy=%s"", securityPolicy);
connectionString += (messageSecurity.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&message-security=%s"", messageSecurity);
connectionString += (serverCertificate.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&server-certificate-file=%s"", serverCertificate);
connectionString += (keyStoreFile.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&key-store-file=%s"", keyStoreFile);
connectionString += (keyStorePassword.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&key-store-password=%s"", keyStorePassword);
connectionString += String.format(""&channel-lifetime=%d"", 3600000);
connectionString += ""&tcp.keep-alive=true"";
```

Maybe it is related to https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/1684?

Is there a configuration setting or a different approach that can help with automatically reestablishing the secure channel once it closes?

Thanks!

Best,
Gustavo.

Thanks a lot for your help—I really appreciate it.

I suspected the issue might be the same, so I'm using the 0.13-SNAPSHOT version for everything, but still didn't make any difference.

      <version>0.13.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

I have a few other ideas that might be causing the problem, so I’ll share all the information I’ve gathered:

1. The issue always occurs when the channel lifetime is about to expire, and the secure channel should be renewed. For example, when I set the channel lifetime to 1 minute, the problem occurs within that 1-minute period. This is one reason I believe it’s not related to resource leaks, as mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1364).

As mentioned earlier, I tried adding `tcp.keep-alive` in hopes of facilitating the reconnection, but it’s still not working. Unfortunately, I’m still unable to pinpoint where the error is coming from.

3. When I check the Prosys OPCUA simulator logs, I can see that it doesn’t attempt to renew the connection; instead, it just closes the channel. Do I need to enable something in the simulator? I’m attaching the logs for your reference.

5. The PLC4x Java logs don’t indicate any issues. Since the logs are quite extensive, I’m attaching them in case you might know where to look.

[java_log.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16687636/java_log.txt)

but we can see when it enters the stall mode in here:

```

It is interesting because when I set both `NONE` for security, I’m also having the same problem. So, it doesn’t seem to be a certificate security issue, which is really strange.

Which Prosys version are you using? If my code is correct, I suspect it could be something related to the simulator.

Here’s what I did:
```java
String messageSecurity = ""NONE"";
String securityPolicy = ""NONE"";

String connectionString = String.format(""opcua:tcp://Yoshi.lab.mtu-digilab.io:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer?discovery=false"");
connectionString += (securityPolicy.isBlank()) ? """" : String.format(""&security-policy=%s"", securityPolicy);

I'm also using the same version of Prosys. I also just tried connecting PLC4x to a Python OPC UA server with no security, and it worked well without any channel lifetime issues, even with a channel lifetime set to 10 seconds.

I'm curious about how your setup with Prosys is configured. Are you using any security settings? And are you using a short channel lifetime to test the token renewal?

    Reason: Bad_SecureChannelIdInvalid (code=0x80220000, description=""The specified secure channel is no longer valid."")
```

From the first log, it appears that the communication occurs normally until the final message, where a new channel is attempted, but the process encounters a `Bad_SecureChannelIdInvalid` error. If you look closely, the last message uses `SecureChannelId: 5` in the OpcUa binary protocol, but the subsequent request has `SecureChannelId: 0`, leading to this error. 

This issue seems similar to https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1213. I had already taken that into consideration and used the `plc4j-transport-tcp` with `0.13.0-SNAPSHOT`, and I have enabled `tcp.keep-alive`. However, it didn't help at all.

Can you identify and issue or a potential solution?

Thanks for your help!

The tcp keep alive won't help in this case, transport level communication is fine, so all packets are flying both directions. Issue comes from application protocol and some gap in our implementation of security protocol. Below quote from the the spec:
> requestType: The type of [SecurityToken](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/search/17?t=SecurityToken) request:
> An enumeration that shall be one of the following:
> * ISSUE_0 creates a new SecurityToken for a new SecureChannel
> * RENEW_1 creates a new SecurityToken for an existing SecureChannel
> secureChannelId: The identifier for the SecureChannel that the new token should belong to. This parameter shall be null when creating a new SecureChannel.

This means that for initial (issue) call, we send `0` for secure channel id, while for renewing we need to send id of channel we got earlier (you will find it in open secure channel response). I can just assume that secure channel 5 was negotiated earlier. I looked at code while writing answer, and this part of specification is satisfied.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86JWReZ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Exactly, that is the issue.

In frame 1539, we can see that the SecureChannel ID is 5. However, when the client tries to renew the SecureChannel in frame 1625, it uses 0 as the SecureChannel ID instead of 5. As I understood, it should be only zero when issuing a new SecureChannel, and that's not the case here.

Actually only addresses of this kind: ` %MX1.0:BOOL` to read from Merker Type of area  are accepted. 
Becase of the regexp:
`""^%(?<memoryArea>.)(?<transferSizeCode>[XBWD]?)(?<byteOffset>\\d{1,7})(.(?<bitOffset>[0-7]))?:(?<dataType>(S5)?[a-zA-Z_]+)(\\[(?<numElements>\\d+)])?""`

on S7Tag class. 
So with the byteOffset only between 1 and 7. 
When it's common to use larger offset. I can read addresses %M1000.0 BOOL using Snap7 on the same PLC. 
I didn't open a bug because probably it comes from a a good practice, but i open feature request at least to open a discussion why not to support a different offset.

PLc Model: Siemens 1200
I can read other datablocks but i got an error when i try to read the block
`%DB52:0:BYTE[3000]`

I am trying to read it, building a simple read request with such tag:
```
readrequestBuilder.addTagAddress(""DB52_bytes"", ""%DB52:0:BYTE[3000]"");
readRequest = readrequestBuilder.build();
```

the block is perfectly readable from Snap7 C# version and Moka7 java version. 
I attach the wireshark dump.

Thanks for your information,

As was pointed out, this amount of data is separated by the optimization routine given the limitations of the PDU size. For an S7-1200, that would be between 11 to 12 requests to move that amount of data.

If you can capture the traces with SNAP7, it would be very useful and help us with this improvement.

A separate note is that you should filter the captures with Wireshark since there are traces that do not apply.

I would also like to see a recording of that ... because Mokka7 doesn't at all respect the PDU size ... they do hard-coded checks like the ""num of items <= 20"" which is too big for an s7-1200 and way too small for an S7-1500. And having a look at the C# implementations I see the same hard-coded limitations. Possibly the driver auto shrinks the request to the max possible (or a hard-coded limit) and doesn't return the full 3000 bytes. But I'm the first to admit I was wrong if I see a recording.

I think it really depends on the type of data you are reading ... when reading bytes of bits, it's I think 12 for an S7-1200 ... however if there's a string in it that already might be too much. The current driver keeps on adding items until adding the next would exceed the size in the request or in the expected response, as soon as it would exceed, it creates a new message and keeps on adding items until this is also full.

Unfortunately adding one item that already exceeds is something the driver currently can't handle. In the old version of the driver (prior to the mspec versions) I had some hard-coded code in there to rewrite items and join them later. I never ported that back as I was expecting a more general purpose optimizer, but I think that's not going to come. So if anyone wants to get his hands dirty, that old code could help.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86JBryJ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

they are bytes, i read the area of bytes and then i tag on the client the chunk of bytes from the buffer to get the values, real or int. 
I need to read the plc 1 time per sec, so it would
 be too slow to read more than 1000 tags singularly in a multivar approach. I tried. 
I have captured the reading with Mokka7. I attach the dump, if it can help.  here i am reading 3838 bytes

I tested the routine with different devices to validate its operation and with different lengths.

For packets that enter within a PDU the routine effectively returns a PlcList in the case of long sections it returns a PvStructure.


I show you the requests step by step:

` 
PlcStruct plcStruct = (PlcStruct) response.getAsPlcValue();                      
PlcValue plcValue =  plcStruct.getValue(""TEST"");
List<PlcValue> plcValues = (List<PlcValue>) plcValue.getList();

ByteBuf buffer = Unpooled.buffer(plcValues.size());
         
plcValues.stream().forEach(b -> buffer.writeByte(b.getByte()));

logger.info(""Es una lista... \r\n"" + ByteBufUtil.prettyHexDump(buffer));`

`

It works for me in all cases.

It seems like PLC4X does not wait for a response from the Ethernet/IP server when reading data (specifically using the Ethernet/IP scanner device in Beckhoff Twincat3 PLCs)

I'm using the following code to test reading:
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String connectionString = ""eip://10.50.100.216:44818?bigEndian=false"";

    try (PlcConnection plcConnection = PlcDriverManager.getDefault().getConnectionManager().getConnection(connectionString)) {
      PlcReadRequest.Builder readBuilder = plcConnection.readRequestBuilder();
      readBuilder.addTagAddress(""Var1"", ""%Var1"");
      PlcReadRequest readRequest = readBuilder.build();
      System.out.println(""--- Reading data ---"");
      PlcReadResponse readResponse = readRequest.execute().get();
      System.out.println(""--- Read complete ---"");
      System.out.println(readResponse.getResponseCode(""Var1""));
      System.out.println(readResponse.getObject(""Var1""));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(""Connection failed"");
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

Stacktrace:

> org.apache.plc4x.java.api.exceptions.PlcInvalidTagException: Var1 invalid
> 	at org.apache.plc4x.java.spi.messages.DefaultPlcReadResponse.getResponseCode(DefaultPlcReadResponse.java:100)
> 	at org.example.Main.main(Main.java:20)

Looking at Wireshark, PLC4X closes the connection before the PLC has a chance to respond to the read request:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13bf2710-e28a-4c19-b4b7-99083be96e0a)

[Capture.pcapng.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17098250/Capture.pcapng.gz)

I can workaround this bug by adding a manual `Thread.sleep` before trying to interact with the read response object:
```java
System.out.println(""--- Reading data ---"");
PlcReadResponse readResponse = readRequest.execute().get();
Thread.sleep(1000);
System.out.println(""--- Read complete ---"");
```

For a TLDR version:
1. Add an Ethernet/IP scanner device:
![Screenshot from 2024-09-23 11-45-06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b683b55-773c-4cdc-8707-8b285f3a4b51)
2. Create a sync task for the device:

3. Create a global variable list called `ETHIP`, which contains variables declared in the `M` memory area:

4. Add the `Tc2_EthernetIP` library to the PLC project:

5. Check the read and write options for tags you want to read/write to:

6. Get the IP address of the Ethernet/IP server from the settings tab:

The I/o Phoenix is connected to my laptop via ethernet cable.

Initially the connection was opened and closed for each read instruction, but subsequently I moved to a managed pool of connections to reuse the same connection.
In this way I managed to reduce reading times and avoided saturating the PLC connections.
Before, opening and closing the connection, took me a total of 1 (max 2) seconds to read each reading.
With a managed pool of already open connections, I can read within the expected 500 ms.


The problem I'm facing now is that if the ethernet cable is disconnected, an Exception is thrown that I can't catch and subsequently the connection to that IP is no longer usable until the route is restarted.

Do you have any idea on how to catch the java.net.SocketException Connection reset?

This is the Camel route:

        .process(exchange -> {
            Map<String, Object> result = tagReaderService.directRead(tagGroupTriggerData.getHost(),

This the tagReaderService.directRead method:

This is the plcPoolConnectionService.readValues invoked:
```java

        ConnectionWrapper connection = getConnectionWrapper(host, port, devicePlugin);
        return connection.readValues(tags);

```
This is the getConnectionWrapper:
```java
    private ConnectionWrapper getConnectionWrapper(final String host, final Integer port, final DevicePlugin devicePlugin) throws PlcConnectionException {
        String key = host + ofNullable(port).map(Object::toString).orElse("""");
        ConnectionWrapper connection = connections.get(key);
        if (connection == null) {

            connections.put(key, connection);
        }
        return connection;
    }
```

And here i create the connection:
```java
    private ConnectionWrapper createNewConnection(final String host, final Integer port, final DevicePlugin devicePlugin) throws PlcConnectionException {
        return switch (devicePlugin) {
            case S7COMM -> ConnectionWrapper.s7Connection(driverManager, host);
            case MODBUS -> ConnectionWrapper.modbusTcpConnection(driverManager, host, port);
            default -> throw new RuntimeException(""Unsupported device plugin: "" + devicePlugin);
        };
    }

    public static ConnectionWrapper modbusTcpConnection(final PlcDriverManager driverManager, final String host, final Integer port) throws PlcConnectionException {
        String connectionString = String.format(MODBUS_TCP_CONNECTION_STRING, host);
        return new ConnectionWrapper(driverManager, connectionString);
    }

    private ConnectionWrapper(final PlcDriverManager driverManager, final String connectionString) throws PlcConnectionException {

For S7 the reconnection is parameterizable in the URL. You can even work with two connections (CPU + CP) and it should reconnect.

I was just thinking of a solution like this, For each PLC I would open 2 connections.
One is a connection, that read data every 500 milliseconds (manageable by configurable parameter), this one takes care of reading the data from the PLC and a second connection managed by a method that always remains active and which in theory should capture the SocketException that Camel currently does not manages.
When the SocketException is catched i will try to reopen the connection before the Camel route start.

my colleague tried to integrate the connection cache, but now I'm going more into the topic of the cache. Thank you :) 

For disconnection problems, we are thinking about how we can handle this type of inconvenience. Maybe with a second Camel route.
We are using plc4x in a factory data reading project.  My colleague and I can contribute but I don't know how skilled we are to be able to contribute effectively, I'm afraid that we don't have enough experience.

These days I'm trying to understand how this type of problem can be solved and maybe I'll keep this issue updated.

The S7 driver already implements the feature you mention and others, supported by the S7-300 or S7-400.

It also implements support for the ConnectionListener interface as Chris points out, so you can know when the driver is disconnected/connected.

I have tag `Mod1.FDPRT.PAP2.Axis[3].Drive.NcToPlc.ActTorque`
`""Axis[3]""` its not an array, its name of plc tag, so i expext that everything works okay, but seems like it is not parsed in `AdsDataTypeTableEntry` during connecting, so it throws exception `PlcRuntimeException: Couldn't find child with name 'Axis[2]' for type 'FB_PAP2_FDPRT'`

in this piece of code, when it succesfully come to `""Axis[3]""` in `remainingAddressParts.get(0)`, in `adsDataTypeTableEntry.getChildren()` there is no such child, so i made conclusion that it is missed during connection fetching of `dataTypeTable`

```
 // Go through all children looking for a matching one.
        for (AdsDataTypeTableChildEntry child : adsDataTypeTableEntry.getChildren()) {
            if (child.getPropertyName().equals(remainingAddressParts.get(0))) {
                AdsDataTypeTableEntry childAdsDataTypeTableEntry = dataTypeTable.get(child.getDataTypeName());
                return resolveDirectAdsTagForSymbolicNameFromDataType(
                    remainingAddressParts.subList(1, remainingAddressParts.size()),
                    currentGroup, currentOffset + child.getOffset(), childAdsDataTypeTableEntry);
            }
        }

```


i made an app that will just do browse request and read all children in a tree
and as soon as i can see that it contains many similar tags defined on my plc
```
var browseRequest = plcConnection.browseRequestBuilder()
                .addQuery(""browse"", """")
                .build();

var browseResponse = browseRequest.execute().get();
var browseItems = browseResponse.getValues(""browse"");
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd23a649-f48d-42e9-9c51-a953efc0ae8d)

and as soon as my plc return this tag, i expect that read request will succeed, but seems `readSymbolTableAndDatatypeTable` acts strange



P.S. or actually that can be a mistake of plcBrowserequest, why it returns me Axis[*] structure in root of request
as i can see it also contains 
    |   +-- Mod1.TSHLN.PAP2.Axis: [List]
debugged a little, here is content of it
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a0c9a8f-9efe-49c9-b089-0cabecc97b14)
Why list does not contain definition of structure?
and some of array content structure just thrown in root of Browse items list?

maybe thats why i just thought that its not an array but static tag name defined by our plc developers

This means that communication works, but driver failed to negotiate a secure channel. This error might appear due to differences in client/server protocol implementation. One of causes for such errors was length of cryptographic nonce  used during handshake.
I asked about demo server, simply to run it on my windows machine and try to communicate with it and see if that's the case or is it maybe config error.

Hello! First of all I'm pretty sure I'm missing something but i'll try.

I created an OPCUA Python server with username or certificates authentication policies. It has been tested with OPCUA Expert and i can access it with both policies methods.

I (and ChatGPT) created a simple standalone example to connect to the server:
```
package opcua;
import org.apache.plc4x.java.api.PlcConnection;
import org.apache.plc4x.java.api.messages.PlcReadRequest;
import org.apache.plc4x.java.api.messages.PlcReadResponse;
import org.apache.plc4x.java.DefaultPlcDriverManager;

import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class OpcUaClientWithCert {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // URL del server OPC UA, con certificato client e chiave privata inclusi
        String serverUrl = ""opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:4840"";
        String discovery = ""true"";
        String securityPolicy = ""Basic256Sha256"";  // Percorso del certificato del client
        String clientKeyStore = "".../client_keystore.p12"";
        String clientKeySotrePass = ""clientKeystorePassword"";         // Password della chiave

        // Modificare la stringa di connessione per includere certificato e chiave privata
        String connectionString = String.format(
                ""%s?discovery=%s&security-policy=%s&key-store-file=%s&key-store-password=%s"",
                serverUrl, discovery, securityPolicy, clientKeyStore, clientKeySotrePass
        );

        String nodeId = ""ns=2;i=2"";  // Sostituire con il nodo che si desidera leggere

        // Connettersi al server OPC UA con certificati
        DefaultPlcDriverManager driverManager = new DefaultPlcDriverManager(); // Crea un'istanza di DefaultPlcDriverManager
		try (PlcConnection connection = driverManager.getConnection(connectionString)) {
            if (connection != null && connection.isConnected()) {
                System.out.println(""Connessione stabilita con il server OPC UA usando certificati."");

                // Creare una richiesta di lettura
                PlcReadRequest.Builder builder = connection.readRequestBuilder();
                builder.addTagAddress(""myNode"", nodeId);  // Aggiungere il nodo da leggere

                PlcReadRequest readRequest = builder.build();

                // Eseguire la lettura in modo asincrono
                CompletableFuture<? extends PlcReadResponse> future = readRequest.execute();
                PlcReadResponse response = future.get();

                // Stampare il risultato
                System.out.println(""Valore letto dal nodo: "" + response.getObject(""myNode""));
            } else {
                System.out.println(""Connessione fallita."");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```

When it runs, I get the ""_Unable to find endpoint.._"" exception in this part of _SecureChannel.java_
```
    private void selectEndpoint(CreateSessionResponse sessionResponse) throws PlcRuntimeException {
        // Get a list of the endpoints which match ours.
        Stream<EndpointDescription> filteredEndpoints = sessionResponse.getServerEndpoints().stream()
            .map(e -> (EndpointDescription) e)
            .filter(this::isEndpoint);

        //Determine if the requested security policy is included in the endpoint
        filteredEndpoints.forEach(endpoint -> hasIdentity(
            endpoint.getUserIdentityTokens().stream()
                .map(p -> (UserTokenPolicy) p)
                .toArray(UserTokenPolicy[]::new)
        ));

        if (this.policyId == null) {
            throw new PlcRuntimeException(""Unable to find endpoint - "" + this.endpoints.get(0));
        }
        if (this.tokenType == null) {
            throw new PlcRuntimeException(""Unable to find Security Policy for endpoint - "" + this.endpoints.get(0));
        }
    }
```


And noticed this is because the policyId is set to null but because **apparently the _hasIdentity_ function has no option for policy other than anonymous and username**:
```
    private void hasIdentity(UserTokenPolicy[] policies) {
        for (UserTokenPolicy identityToken : policies) {
            if ((identityToken.getTokenType() == UserTokenType.userTokenTypeAnonymous) && (this.username == null)) {
                policyId = identityToken.getPolicyId();
                tokenType = identityToken.getTokenType();
            } else if ((identityToken.getTokenType() == UserTokenType.userTokenTypeUserName) && (this.username != null)) {
                policyId = identityToken.getPolicyId();
                tokenType = identityToken.getTokenType();
            }
        }
    }
```

The policies that my server returns correspond to the ones i set with the python script:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f8d3f01-75df-4469-b082-9c4f66c1d69e)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2570905a-d1e0-4024-9112-dd76804b079a)

What am I missing? Shouldn't the library allow this kind of access with just the cetificate? I expected other ""if"" for certificate policies. Did i end up in other functions that should not be used for this policies? In this case, is there something wrong with the main function? 

Please note that the example works if i modify the connection string by just adding the username & password, correctly reading the node value:

 ```
       String serverUrl = ""opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:4840"";
        String discovery = ""true"";
        String securityPolicy = ""Basic256Sha256"";  // Percorso del certificato del client
        String clientKeyStore = ""..../client_keystore.p12"";
        String clientKeySotrePass = ""clientKeystorePassword"";         // Password della chiave
        String userName = ""user1"";
        String password = ""password1"";
        // Modificare la stringa di connessione per includere certificato e chiave privata
        String connectionString = String.format(
                ""%s?discovery=%s&security-policy=%s&key-store-file=%s&key-store-password=%s&username=%s&password=%s"",
                serverUrl, discovery, securityPolicy, clientKeyStore, clientKeySotrePass, userName, password
        );
```

But it does not surprise me  because it is using the username policy in this case (even if Basic256Sha256 is still specified)

All security policies defined by spec are covered, with a small note of bug fixed in 0.13-SNAPSHOT and discovered thanks to issue #1802. In 0.12 you need to make sure that both client and server certificates use same private key length.
One important note - certificate authentication policy is not supported yet.

With regard to endpoint selection logic - you most likely need to define also message security (message-security=SIGN or SIGN_ENCRYPT) in order to use password authentication. I think spec mandates use of encryption in case of password authentication, however most of software servers are quite relaxed about that.
There was small adjustment of endpoint selection logic in #1830, so 0.13-SNAPSHOT again might behave slightly different than 0.12. Later have a bug which could lead to incompatibilities with  servers which defined multiple `UserTokenPolicy` with distinct identifiers.

My advise is to try with develop (checkout project and do `mvn install -Pwith-java`) to see if its any better. If not, then please enable debug logging for `org.apache.plc4x.java.opcua.protocol` and attach logs generated by your application.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86REa6a/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I admit it's a lack of knowledge from my point of view. Just a bit of context:
I'm developing an OPCUA client for a server developed by a third party, it currently has no authentication but i know for a fact that this third party will want to use **certificate authentication OR username+password**.
I developed a python OPCUA server to test my client, so it currently looks like this:

```
from opcua import Server, ua
import time
import random

# Imposta il server
server = Server()

# Imposta l'endpoint del server
server.set_endpoint(""opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:4840"")

# Aggiungi un namespace personalizzato
uri = ""urn:freeopcua:python:server""
idx = server.register_namespace(uri)

# Imposta le politiche di sicurezza
server.set_security_policy([
    ua.SecurityPolicyType.Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt  # Connessioni sicure con cifratura
])

# Imposta i tipi di sicurezza
server.set_security_IDs([""Basic256Sha256"", ""Username""])

### AUTENTICAZIONE CON USERNAME E PASSWORD ###
def user_manager(isession, username, password):
    users = {
        ""user1"": ""password1"",
        ""user2"": ""password2""
    }
    if username in users and users[username] == password:
        print(f""Login riuscito per l'utente: {username}"")
        return True
    else:
        print(f""Tentativo di login fallito per l'utente: {username}"")
        return False

# Configura il server per utilizzare l'autenticazione username/password
server.user_manager.set_user_manager(user_manager)

### AUTENTICAZIONE CON CERTIFICATI ###
server.load_certificate(""certificates/server_certificate.der"")
server.load_private_key(""certificates/server_private_key.pem"")

[...]
server.start()

try:
    while True:
        [...]
        time.sleep(1)  # Aspetta 1 secondo
finally:
    # Ferma il server al termine
    server.stop()
```

So what I'm doing is trying to authenticate with either username+password or certificates.
I proved that i can authenticate with user+psw, but did i correctly understand that even the 0.13SNAPSHOT does not support the certificate authentication method? It doesn't look like it does from the commit you linked, will the library support it in the foreseeable future?
 
Alo, is the server setup correctly for this scope (authentication with user+sw OR certificate) ? Again, lack of my knowledge, sorry for that, but i just want to ensure that I'm not misinterpreting things:

```
server.set_security_policy([
    ua.SecurityPolicyType.Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt  
])

server.set_security_IDs([""Basic256Sha256"", ""Username""])
```

Looking at your code I think you probably mix certificate authentication with transport level encryption. The OPC-UA protocol can use certificates to secure communication channel as well as to authenticate user. While I know little about python, below lines look more like transport level security:
```python
server.load_certificate(""certificates/server_certificate.der"")
server.load_private_key(""certificates/server_private_key.pem"")
```

Another point - python code snippet uses `ua.SecurityPolicyType.Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt`. In Apache PLC4X ua client this value is split into two connection options `security-policy=Basic256Sha256` and `message-security=SIGN_ENCRYPT`.

Both 0.12 and 0.13-SNAPSHOT support SIGN_ENCRYPT and can work with certificates. The keystore you configure is client private key and certificate used to secure channel. This certificate can be used by server to accept or refuse connection.

If you will have a look on https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part4/v104/docs/7.37 you will find there are few options for tokenType (UserTokenType): Anonymous, Username, Certificate, IssuedToken. We support only first two, however this does not prevent you at all from using certificates to secure channel.

You're right, I'm mixing certificates authentication with encryption.
Apparently the python opcua library uses those same key/certificates for both purposes, both on client and server side.
I'm sure about this because i can login into the configured server via UA Expert by providing the client certificates path.

I still don't understand the following:
I now configured the python server to use encryption communication and user/psw authentication
```
#Communication 
server.set_security_policy([
    ua.SecurityPolicyType.Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt 
])

#Authentication
server.set_security_IDs([""Username""])

#Certificates
server.load_certificate(""certificates/server_certificate.der"")
server.load_private_key(""certificates/server_private_key.pem"")
```

But how is that possible that I'm able to login into the server via PLC4J / UA Expert by just providing the username+password without a certificate?
 ```
String serverUrl = ""opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:4840"";
String discovery = ""true"";
String securityPolicy = ""Basic256Sha256"";  // Percorso del certificato del client
String messageSecurity = ""SIGN_ENCRYPT"";
String username = ""user1"";
String password = ""password1"";

String connectionString = String.format(
        ""%s?discovery=%s&security-policy=%s&message-securty=%s&username=%s&password=%s"",
        serverUrl, discovery, securityPolicy, messageSecurity, username, password
);
```
I again admit to be a noob, but my only explanation to this is that only server certificate matters for communication encryption? Why do you say that the keystore on client side is used to secure channel?
Maybe i can use it instead to provide it to the server in case it need a trusted clients list?

In case if user does not provide a certificate it will be generated by client. It is an one off certificate which is not retained. For servers which validate transport level certificates we have options to provide PKCS12 encoded certificate and private key. Then you can specify these using following parameters: `key-store-type=pkcs12, key-store-file=/a/b.p12, key-store-password=<pass>`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86RIccH/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am launching an OPCUA server through Docker running the following .py file:

    uri = ""http://examples.freeopcua.github.io""
    idx = await server.register_namespace(uri)
    ns = ""ns=2;s=freeopcua.Tags.pressure""

    # populating our address space

    _logger.info(""Starting server!"")
    async with server:

I wanted to try out the OPC UA driver, but I'm unsure if I'm making a major mistake or if parsing string options simply hasn't been implemented yet. Following the documentation it seems to be implemented at least: https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/opcua.html

```
package main

import (
	""fmt""

	plc4go ""github.com/apache/plc4x/plc4go/pkg/api""
	""github.com/apache/plc4x/plc4go/pkg/api/drivers""
	""github.com/apache/plc4x/plc4go/pkg/api/transports""
)

func main() {
	// Create a new instance of the PlcDriverManager
	driverManager := plc4go.NewPlcDriverManager()

	// Register the Transports
	transports.RegisterTcpTransport(driverManager)
	transports.RegisterUdpTransport(driverManager)

	// Register the Drivers
	drivers.RegisterOpcuaDriver(driverManager)

	// Set connection options, including username and password. Same error with or without the /UA/Plant Path
	connectionRequestChannel := driverManager.GetConnection(""opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:7894/UA/Plant?username=user1&password=password1"")
	// Wait for the connection to be established
	connectionResult := <-connectionRequestChannel



	// Check if something went wrong
    if connectionResult.GetErr() != nil {
	    fmt.Printf(""Error connecting to PLC: %s"", connectionResult.GetErr().Error())
		return
	}

	connection := connectionResult.GetConnection()

	// Make sure the connection is closed at the end
	defer connection.Close()

**Error connecting to PLC: can't parse options: string not yet supported**
```

Source of behaviour is the ParseFromOptions function in Configuration.go of opcua not having implemented a string case.

It's a Feature Request because I'm not sure.

When using Modbus TCP gateways, the gateways can aggregate multiple Modbus devices using unit ids. Such gateways unfortunately also seem to sometimes have limits on how many TCP connections can be active at the same time, due to which forming a connection per unit id is not feasible. Is there a way in PLC4X to share the TCP connection between different connection strings? I know of the connection cache, but it caches per connection string, which is different per unit id in this case.

Hi Plc4x Team and @splatch . I was testing Plc4x with Mitsubishi PLC. I was not able to read and write **WORD, DWORD and WSTRING datatype**. It gave me **""Datatype WORD is unsupported by this protocol"" error** as can be seen in pic below:-

I want to ask whether OPC-UA especially Plc4j supports these 3 Datatypes (WORD, DWORD, WSTRING)? I was able to read and write with other Datatypes such as INT, REAL, BOOL, STRING. Any help regrading this ?

**Current behavior:** An OPC-UA subscription request with N tags will return a collection of N identical PlcSubscriptionHandles.  Registering a handler for all of these handles will result in N callbacks for every tag.  Registering a handler for just one of these handles and ignoring all of the others will result in one callback for every tag change.

**Expected behavior:** Registering a handler for every subscription handle returned by a subscription request (as described in the documentation, literally a copy/paste of the example from the PLC4X docs) should result in a single callback to the handler for every tag change, not multiple callbacks.  In order to achieve this, either the subscription request should return one single PlcSubscriptionHandle, or N unique PlcSubscriptionHandles.

**Example showing the problem:**
```
PlcSubscriptionRequest subReq = opcConnector.subscriptionRequestBuilder()
      .addChangeOfStateTagAddress(""Weight"", ""Weight"")
      .addChangeOfStateTagAddress(""Jam"", ""Jam"")
      .addChangeOfStateTagAddress(""HeightAlarm"", ""HeightAlarm"")
      .build();

Collection<PlcSubscriptionHandle> shs = subReq.execute().get().getSubscriptionHandles();</code>
```
After the above code is executed, shs now contains 3 identical PlcSubscriptionHandles.  If 3 more tags were to be added to the subscription request, then shs would contain 6 identical PlcSubscriptionHandles.

@codekundan @hyslopc  AFAIR you can try to adjust that, you need to use cyclic subscription. Cycle duration used for first tag will dictate cycle time for polling OPC-UA server:

If not provided it is assumed to be 1s. OPC-UA protocol itself requires publish request to receive publish response with changed tag values, so you can reduce load, at the cost of bigger delay since possible value change.

Channel lifetime is declared by server, when secure channel is open or renewed. For that reason we do not have a setting for that, we just rely on what server wants.
If you suspect any resource leak then renewing of channel might possibly be guilty (AFAIR it was guilty of some thread leak before), other place could be subscription handles which also need to submit asynchronously a publish request, beside your application logic.

This is easily addressed by adding configuration parameter endpoint-host=<hostname> so now the URL (**URL 1**) looks like this:
```
opcua:tcp://10.3.1.13:4840?endpoint-host=ahostname
```
- however that leads to a new problem: v0.13.0 tries to connect to the server using ahostname instead of using the IP address 10.3.1.13.  This makes no sense: if we wanted to connect via hostname, we would use a much simpler URL (**URL 2**):
```
opcua:tcp://ahostname:4840
```
Thankfully, the code falls back to connecting via IP address, however it takes quite a bit of extra time, and a lot of errors and warnings are generated in the log.  IMHO this is illogical: there is already a very simple way to connect to OPC UA servers via hostname (via **URL 2**).  The only reason for the endpoint-host parameter that I am aware of is where the endpoint hostname and the connection address differ, with the point being to use the connection address (and not endpoint-host) to connect.

It should be possible to connect to an OPC UA server via IP address without any attempts to connect via hostname, ergo the format opcua:tcp://xxx?endpoint-host=hostname used by **URL 1** above should connect using xxx and not hostname.

Thank you for report, you are right that we have maybe not conflicting, but somewhat overlapping logic. This comes from fact that the difference between connected server and advertised hostname in its endpoints, which you mentioned, is indeed quite common.
The `endpoint-host` and `endpoint-port` parameters are recent inventions in 0.13 which allowed us to have a dynamic port/host pairs within unit tests, but as you found, can address also above problem. I have not removed earlier logic (attempting to resolve ip from host etc.) simply to avoid behavior change.

I'm not sure there's a need to have a separate branch for docs for each minor release. So keeping the 0.12 docs on the rel/0.12 branch, then if a 0.12.1 is released, the website for version 0.12 would get incremented to 0.12.1 in the examples, and we wouldn't have the 0.12.0 referenced on the website anymore (Except for the release notes).

Production use case:
- Constantly reading and writing (every second) from and to a Plc via modbus tcp.

Issue:
- After running for days (or weeks depend on -Xmx) the application crashes because an OutOfMemoryError.

Comparing dumps (from production) show an increase of byte[] objects like:
 `java.lang.String#45053 : FooRxEntity$ByteBuddy$opFq0T9M$auxiliary$5LGzfXOE`.

The ByteBuddy instances are created here:
```org.apache.plc4x.java.opm.PlcEntityManager#connect(java.lang.Class<T>, java.lang.String, T)``` 

therefore I think that PlcEntityManager is responsible for the leak.

Code to reproduce the issue:
```java
import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any;

  @Test
  void shouldRead() throws PlcConnectionException {
    MockDevice mockDevice = Mockito.mock(MockDevice.class);
    DefaultPlcDriverManager driverManager = new DefaultPlcDriverManager();
    MockConnection connection = (MockConnection) driverManager.getConnection(""mock:test"");
    when(mockDevice.read(any())).thenAnswer(invocation -> new ResponseItem(PlcResponseCode.OK, new PlcSTRING(""1"")));
    connection.setDevice(mockDevice);

    PlcEntityManager entityManager = new PlcEntityManager(driverManager);

    while (true) {
      try {
        FooRxEntity read = entityManager.read(FooRxEntity.class, ""mock:test"");

      } catch (InterruptedException e) {

```

The test is started with VM options `-Xms128m -Xmx128m`. After ~4 minutes OOM is thrown.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e961d1b-2e69-40a9-b468-b77fdfbdbcf0)

I can reproduce the OOE with a real connection. This take a lot more time because the plc support a max reading rate of ~300ms.
Real test:
```java
  @Test
  void shouldRead() {
    PlcDriverManager driverManager = new DefaultPlcDriverManager();
    PlcConnectionManager connectionManager = driverManager.getConnectionManager();
    PlcEntityManager entityManager = new PlcEntityManager(connectionManager);

    while (true) {
      try {
        FooRxEntity read = entityManager.read(FooRxEntity.class, ""modbus-tcp:tcp://192.168.100.222:502"");
        Thread.sleep(300);
      } catch (OPMException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
      }
    }
  }

I wonder if the EtherNet/IP Implicit Messaging is supported in the current version (0.12.0) of plc4j-driver-eip ? 

If not, is it a good idea to use the plc4j API just to create a EtherNet/IP connection, then writing some  code to read message at port 2222 and handle the CPF data by myself ?

As far as I can see it, the implicit messaging would correlate nicely to our Subscription API. Also would our connection concept support an UDP ""connection"". So in theory the ideal solution would be that you implement the missing subscription functionality as part of the PLC4X EIP driver and work with the rest of the PLC4X community to finish it?

That would be more sustainable from your perspective as otherwise you'll have to maintain your functionality manually, by doing it the open-source way, you sort of get maintenance for free.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86Yi7fe/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This however is part of commons-lang3 ... could it be that you are explicitly importing commons-lang3 in a version that doesn't have `getAllFields`? The API documentation says it exists since version 3.2 ... so are you possibly using an older version?,"{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBtifa86Yi5T8/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When trying to query multiple values as a collection using a single tag, as follows, the (inner) datatypes returned do not match the field.
```java
@PlcTag(""input-register:1:UINT[2]"")
private List<Integer> registers;
```
The field on the returned (ByteBuddy proxy) instance would be of type `List<PlcUINT>`. The problem is that if we then want to use list elements as `Integer`, this causes a `ClassCastException`.

The expected behavior IMO would be that the list is of type `List<Integer>` similar as it works for single values, e.g, `@PlcTag(""input-register:1:UINT"")` => `int`.

_Note_:
When trying to use an array, e.g., `int[]` instead, the field can not be assigned at all, as the call returns a list.

```java
Object responseObject = response.getObject(sourceFieldName);

}
```
The preferrable option would be to call the respective `PlcReadResponse::getAll...` instead of `PlcReadResponse::getObject` if the field type is a collection (or array). For this, the generic type might need to be determined though. While for arrays, this can be done using `Class::getComponentType`, for collections `TypeToken` might be the way to go. Additionally, if specific collection types should be supported, further processing might be required as `PlcReadResponse::getAll...` returns a generic `Collection`.

Curently the default of the website guides people to use the SNAPSHOT version of PLC4X. We should change this to show the last released version per default and give people the chance to update to the SNAPSHOT version of it.

I had a look and there were several issues:
1. You name the protocol ""fins"" in protocols/omron/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/protocol/omron/FinsProtocol.java but you try to use it as ""omron"" in plc4j/drivers/omron/pom.xml ... the two have to match, I tried setting it to ""fins"" and it picked up the protocol definition
2. Your mspec had multiple issues:
    - There was an odd prefix to the mspec: ""好的，根据你提供的西门子PLC S7协议的MSpec文件结构，我将为你生成一个详细的Omron FINS协议的MSpec文件。这个文件将包括FINS协议的基本消息结构、请求和响应消息、以及一些常见的命令和响应。

### Omron FINS协议MSpec文件

```freemarker"" ... that needed to be removed. 
     - You repeatedly defined byte-arrays like this:
             [simple byte[] data length 'wordCount * 2'] 
        However this needed to be changed to: 
            [array  byte    data length 'wordCount * 2']
        (Notice the keyword ""array"" instead of ""simple""? Also the bracets needed to be removed
     - In line 192 (187 after removing the header) you define a string simple type ... strings need a fixed number of bits ... vstring doesn't, but that requires an expression on how long the string should be
     - Your enum FINSResponseCode had one additional closing square bracket, that needed to be removed

With these changes I was able to generate the code for your mspec and compile it.

But to your question: Your first option looks absolutely standard. It's also exactly the use case we built the discriminated types for. I would definitely reccommend doing that.

Also we recently added the ability of nested typeSwitches. In the past you couldn't nest these and you needed to add additional intermediate types. Now you could even have for examples multiple types of FINSReadRequests which share some common properties.

If the protocol doesn't provide the information needed to decide between request and response, you can also pass in arguments from the driver (Have a look in the Modbus Protocol).

The major version change usually indicates that. I would assume you need to update the code of the adapter to the new version and API.

I'm sorry if I gave the impression that I was using PLC4X with custom development. I'm actually using the .nar from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.plc4x/plc4j-nifi-plc4x-nar/0.12.0. I also tested building the .nar 0.13 from the plc4x-extras repository, but the same error occurred.

I ran a clean version of Apache NiFi in Docker with versions 1.28.0, 2.0.0, and 2.1.0 using the following Dockerfile:
`version: ""3.8""

services:
  nifi:
    image: apache/nifi:1.28.0
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
    container_name: nifi
    restart: always

    volumes:
      - ./lib:/opt/nifi/nifi-current/extensions
      - ./lib_2:/opt/nifi/nifi-current/nar_extensions
`
When running version 1.x, everything works fine, but in version 2.x, the error mentioned below appears.

I checked the logs, and when I click on the processors in the NiFi UI, this error occurs. Additionally, PLC4X is not found among the available processors.

Yes, this is likely the problem. I will keep the production Apache NiFi at version 1.28.1 and hope that version 0.13, when officially released, will support nifi 2.x versions.

Afterward, I tried building it by cloning the branch from the PR itself, but I encountered some build issues that seem to have been resolved in later commits on the develop branch.

When testing the import in NiFi, everything worked fine. However, I don’t have any CLP devices at home to test with, so I plan to test this NAR at my company tomorrow.

I have a few questions:

- Do you think it would be better to rebuild these changes based on the main branch instead of the develop branch?
- At home, I built the package on my Arch Linux system. Should I build it on another OS instead? I noticed that PLC4X uses Ubuntu images. Would you recommend building it from a clean Docker image?

If I simply copy the NAR into Apache NiFi, it doesn't run. I initially thought that the .nar file contains all the dependencies, but it seems that's not the case. Am I missing something, or is it always necessary to build the package? I’m trying to understand if it’s possible to create a .nar file that can just be copied and pasted into NiFi, or if I need to create a Dockerfile that runs NiFi, then compiles the NAR using the pom.xml and installs all the dependencies.

My tests on CLP devices are working as expected. I will continue testing until the end of the week and aim to try a pre-production version, migrating from NiFi 2.

Reading eight tags every second from a S7_1200 PLC with S7 with version 0.12.0 it works, but with 0.13.0-SNAPSHOT after a while the connection drops and cannot be restored; it gets stuck in a loop at:

        }
    }

On failure, it creates up to 40 connections, then closes them, and continues opening and closing connections without establishing a working one.

# Problem or use case
Read the ""Symbolic Names"" from the Siemens PLCs instead of defining the ""Addresses"" of the values in the PLCs. Reading addresses is considered a legacy method to read values but it seems plc4x only supports this method

Preferred solution or suggestions
Implement ""symbolic addressing"" of values in the Siemens S7 PLCs.

Well that's a known problem. 
We also would like to provide symbolic addressing. However it's not that simple.
In order to do that, we would need to completely implement a new protocol (S7Comm Plus).
In the past it was impossible to do so because of legal reasons. 

Even if Siemens has changed things that now make it possible to implement a S7Comm Plus driver, there is currently nobody able and willing to work on this. I personally have given up investing my free time if I'm not compensated for it in any form. Perhaps someone else is willing to pick up the ball. 

So currently don't expect this to happen any time soon.
