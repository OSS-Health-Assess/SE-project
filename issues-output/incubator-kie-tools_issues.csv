I noticed that the undo in VSCode is not working in some cases, for example when you create a decision or new input nodes (and so on). 
In addition to those cases, it does not work when you set the type for the decisions and you try undo the steps (but actually in those cases I might agree that the undo should just work on the visual components, i.e. it should not undo stuff on the background like type of decisions and other properties).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/69/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

One think I noticed working on [the AtlasMap POC](https://github.com/riccardo-forina/atlasmap-kogito-tooling) is that I was getting the [Invalid Hook Call Warning
](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html) error in the console. Ultimately, it was due to `@kogito/core-api` declaring React as direct dependency, which causes for multiple versions of React being embedded in the bundle. Since AtlasMap is written solely using hooks, this issue come up immediately.

A [quick workaround](https://github.com/riccardo-forina/atlasmap-kogito-tooling/blob/master/packages/simple-react-editors/webpack.config.js#L32-L45) was to instruct WebPack to consider React an external dependency, but it would be better to make React and React DOM peer dependencies in the `core-api` package.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/173/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks for reporting that. I'm glad to see you're using our packages :)

Initially, we thought that we should be the ones in control of React/ReactDOM versions, since some things that we offer as a library/framework is dependent on the React API. You can simply remove your declaration of React and ReactDOM on your modules so that no conflicting versions exist.

However, I also think that we should give users the flexibility of choosing the exact React version to use. Since peerDependencies are not downloaded by default, we would be making it mandatory to declare your version of React/ReactDOM. More than that, it would be possible to choose an incompatible version of React/ReactDOM, resulting in build failures.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but I'm really not sure yet what's I think is the best approach, so if you could provide more information about why having your own declaring of React/ReactDOM is important, I guess it would help us make a decision :)

React and React DOM should be a dependency of the final consumer. Taking the template as an example, React and React DOM should be declared as a dependency of the `chrome-extension-pack-simple-react` and `vscode-extension-pack-simple-react` packages that are the ""final"" outputs. `simple-react-editor` should also declare React as a peer dependency, since that package acts as a library and not a final output.

I think it's a bit easier if we visualize the problem. I cloned the template repo, instructed webpack to generate the stats file to feed to [`webpack-bundle-analyzer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) and run it against the `simple-react-editor` package and the `chrome-extension-pack-simple-react`. Here is the result:

## `simple-react-editor`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/966316/85110981-ff906f80-b213-11ea-8f19-6685059a48cf.png)

This package gets bundled together with React, because React is a direct dependency of the `core-api` package.

## `chrome-extension-pack-simple-react`

This package gets bundled together with React too because React is a direct dependency of the `core-api` package, but since there is also a dependency on `simple-react-editor` an additional copy of React gets bundled in the final output.

This leads to a bigger bundle size because of the duplicated version of React, and to bugs like the one in the opening comment.

In general the rule of thumb should be that if you are distributing a reusable module, dependencies should be declared as peer dependencies so to avoid these issues. It's then up to the consumer of the library to add the required dependencies to its project. For example, if I want to use, say, [`react-table`](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/blob/master/package.json#L46-L48) I also have to add `react` as a dependency to my project.

When you're creating `Editor`s in React, the package containing them is responsible for providing a React component that's actually an editor, so essentially, this package is a 'library'. Let's say you create a package called `my-editor`.

Of course, to run this editor, you'll need an 'app'. That's what we call the Envelope, which is essentially a webapp that runs inside an iframe in a containing 'app', which we call the Channel (e.g. Desktop, VS Code, Chrome Extension etc).

To create this Envelope 'app', we provide a library called `microeditor-envelope` (we'll probably rename that to `envelope-lib`, so that's how I'm going to refer to that from now on).

This Envelope 'app' is actually assembled with the help of two libraries -- `my-editor` and `envelope-lib`. Let's say that your Envelope application is created in your `my-envelope-app` package.

With all that said, I think that `envelope-lib` and `my-editor` should declare React and ReactDOM as peerDependencies, and the Envelope application should declare them as a dependencies. (See an Envelope application `index.ts` example here: https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling-examples/blob/master/packages/chrome-extension-pack-simple-react/src/envelope/index.ts

The ideal hierarchy of packages is as follows:


```
         my-envelope-app <-- (That's where we declare React and ReactDOM as `dependency`)
         /             \
envelope-lib         my-editor
                          \
                        editor-api
```

As you might've noticed, we don't have a package called `editor-api`, making `my-editor` depend on `core-api` and `envelope-lib`, which is not ideal.

This way, only 'app' packages would declare a concrete version of React and ReactDOM, making everything else peer-depend on React and ReactDOM. This gives more flexibility for users of our platform. How does that sound to you? :)

---

**NOTE:** One thing I'd like to clarify that is not related to this whole conversation above is how we mark a dependency as `external`. It's the bundlers job to do that (e.g. Webpack), and the reason you're seeing React and ReactDOM bundled inside `simple-react-editor` on `kogito-tooling-examples` is because the `webpack.config.js` is wrong. See https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling-examples/blob/master/packages/simple-react-editors/webpack.config.js#L30.

This line should actually be like this one: https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/blob/master/packages/kie-bc-editors/webpack.config.js#L32.

This makes Webpack bundle the package without its dependencies, making it only contain the classes it exports.

Looks like both your issues are related to custom work item definition support and custom tasks.

We kind have initial support for WID, it's just a matter of placing the wid file in the same directory of your bpmn file on VS Code.

But keep in mind the following limitations:

- The wid parser currently is a POC. The official implementation is tracked here: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-3527
- There are some types of business central that are currently not supported. See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-3529 for more details

Is there any way to get this working without creating my own bundled standalone editor? Why is the iframe needed at all?

Sorry, I never used kogito tooling before, so my questions quite be a bit clumsy.

Those console errors are not related to CSP errors, but a known issue on this distribution. They can be safely ignored (soon we will fix those false alarms).

Regarding iframe usage, we mostly use them to isolate context from the outer application (micro front-end friendly). We don't use the iframe ""src"" attribute, but instead we use “srcdoc” to include all the necessary resources for the editor loading inline, so the editor's bundle works without any external resources. 

Kind Regards,
Paulo.

Like really minimal versions can be these on CI system, but it is not written like that so anybody can start with for instance NodeJS v14.17.0 which is LTS. So my idea was more on having strict border as minimal build tools versions.
If CI uses 16.2.0 and nobody will use older i would take it as the minimal required one.

I have a DMN model, exported from the KIE sandbox as the following ZIP file [test-list-combiner.zip](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/files/7604694/test-list-combiner.zip).

There are two leaf filters which return either ""Rejected"" or ""Approved"". A list kind decision box aggregates its results in a list. Then the top level decision boxes evaluate this list. If there is at least one ""Rejected"", the result is ""Rejected"". Otherwise it's ""Approved"".

The problem is on how the evaluation nodes are implemented. As show below, the FEEL expression is used in the output column and this setup is working correctly.

However, when I have this other setup below, the rejected state is not picked up from the list.

Any idea of what's going on?

To let your example work, please substitute the `Combine Filters` parameter of `list contains` function with `?` special character, like the following:

`contains( ? , ""Rejected"")`

![Screenshot from 2021-12-09 14-49-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16005046/145408505-b1951cc9-170b-4f5b-9ff9-4b1c98f752a2.png)

This is required whenever you need to extend a unary test using a built-in function. ""?"" represents the actual variable value.

DMN validation does not work in online-editor if the file being edited includes and uses types or decisions from another DMN file (Included Models feature). Looks like online-editor sends only the contents of the current file and does not include imported resources in the request payload.

**Test Case**
1. Open https://sandbox.kie.org/ -> Upload -> Select folder - select the folder with DMN files from [validateIncludedIssue.zip](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/files/7745462/validateIncludedIssue.zip). There are 2 DMN files in this folder: root.dmn and types.dmn. root.dmn imports types.dmn and contains a single ""const"" decision that returns a value of type ""types.CustomType"" defined in types.dmn. This is just for demo purposes, any case with Included Models will do.
2. Select ""root"" decision and try to edit it.

**Expected Result**
/jitdmn/validate endpoint successfully returns with errors  / warnings / no messages - depending on the changes

**Actual Result**
/jitdmn/validate endpoint returns 500 http status code
DMN Runner logs:
```

**Root Cause**
online-editor doesn't send the contents of the included resource in the payload:

  ""resources"": [
    {
      ""URI"": ""root.dmn"",

Thanks for trying our tools and taking the time to write those issues. It really helps us improve!

This is indeed an issue and we're already looking into fixing it. There are two major points to consider here:

1. We need to know which models are referenced from the open model. Recursively. We're already planning to add support for that on https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-6141
2. Although the KIE Tooling Extended Services validation route already accepts sending multiple models, it needs also to associate validation messages with the path of the file. cc @tarilabs

Let's keep this issue open until we have a proper fix for it. We'll keep it up to date.

We would like to use the functions defined in https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/blob/7.62.0.Final/kie-dmn/kie-dmn-feel/src/main/java/org/kie/dmn/feel/runtime/functions/extended/KieExtendedDMNFunctions.java.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/720/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

#### Standalone Editors

1. After you've successfully built the project following the instructions above, go to `packages/kie-editors-standalone`.
2. Open a terminal and run `yarn start`. This will start a `webpack serve` instance with the Standalone Editors test page.
3. From now on you can use the development version of the Standalone DMN Editor by accessing `https://localhost:9001/resources/dmn` and the Standalone BPMN Editor by accessing `https://localhost:9001/resources/bpmn`.
###########

but when I run '`yarn start` , i got the below error message. I want to know what steps I am missing.

You mean adding a new field in some of the BPMN domain model objects? If so, lemme explain.

The main goal for _Metadata Attributes_, in the _Advanced Data_ section, is for adding any key-value pair which you can futther use on the runtime execution, but it's not itself being exposed (neither serialized in the BPMN file) as a concrete ""new"" field for the target object (task, whatever). Anyway, this field is useful because you can store metadata there, also it is being ported in the BPMN file , and use it on your runtime enviornment.

On he other hand, each model object, for instance a task, has a set of fields, each one showing as a separate field in the forms (look a tthe right panel _Properties_). Those fields usually are following the BPMN spec as well. These fields are being modeled as Java beans, in the core of the BPMN editor, see [1] and check all class fields annotated with the `@Property` annotation. 
So if you want to add fields at this level, you'll have to add new fields in the java class, and also I understand update the actual marshallers code for its proper serialization. It means you have to deal with the given repo [1] and use Java/GWT in order to do this. If at some point you're interested on, there are actually README's about how to build the repository and so you can play with it.  

Hope it helps!
Thanks

Actually there exist a known issue with mediators, specially with panning, which prevents me from properly testing it. We have 2 issues already reported [1] [2], both under our scope for fixing in the short term. Not sure if you're also facing with any of those?

Although I guess what you describe may be a different topic.. . If that's the case, can you please share some reproducer video or screenshots, it will help us to properly understand the root for the wrong behavior.

Thanks!

I am looking at replicating similar features as: https://github.com/StephenOTT/Workflow-Linter and https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler-linter-plugin but for Kogito.

Has there been work on this capability within Kogito?

In the above links, I have combined two types of linting: UI Linter which parses in JS and displays in the UI, and then  a server linter (which the UI can also use): where the server linter parses into the server presentation and runs a series of rules: This is great for modeler dev, but also deployment control to ensure processes/apps meet requirements and reduce bugs.

Initial review for server side lint led me to the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/blob/main/jbpm/jbpm-bpmn2/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/process/bpmn2/BpmnProcessCompiler.java class which is used for compiling the .bpmn file into a Process Definition  / ""BpmnProcess"" ?

or ProcessCodegen.class?

**(Answer: There are only two task endpoints generated, but there are three unique task definitions)**


The Name/TaskNames are not unique and not enforced to be unique during deployment.

In the XML we have the ~true unique name: 

```xml
<bpmn2:userTask id=""_8B9E78DF-5DCE-44D1-B37E-707166B06BC4"" name=""My Task Name&#10;Row 2"">
...
<bpmn2:userTask id=""_FFCD0178-2716-4E16-B593-692770BC9E8B"" name=""Task"">
...
<bpmn2:userTask id=""_4AD34142-F892-439D-AA0C-6AB8C4B95999"" name=""Task"">
```

ignoring the ~weird drools extensions that get auto added for a moment:

```xml
      <bpmn2:userTask id=""_4AD34142-F892-439D-AA0C-6AB8C4B95999"" name=""Task"">
        <bpmn2:extensionElements>
          <drools:metaData name=""elementname"">
            <drools:metaValue><![CDATA[Task]]></drools:metaValue>
          </drools:metaData>
        </bpmn2:extensionElements>
...
```

The `id` for a bpmn element is usually the unique identifier.  The ID is not super friendly at the moment, and understandably someone chose something in the BPMN that would be cleaner.  Would this suggest that Kogito wants to enforce unique Drools meta values ?   IMO would be MUCh cleaner for XML readability if the extension was not used and the `id` property was used here.  makes it much easier to read node execution history events as well.

Either way, the at the moment the problem is endpoints do not get generated as expected.  If we are saying that this is expected because the task instance ID would be unique, then why are we generated named endpoints (where the task endpoint has the Task Name in the url)? the answer seems to be so so you could have Schema support for each task, and if that is the case then we seem to be back to the issue described above.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/775/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This was caused by Quay.io not being able to accept pushes to new image versions, so we opted to not include any packages other than the VS Code Extensions in the release, which featured the new Serverless Workflow Editor extension.

We apologize for this package not being available at the moment and that the instructions on the README are currently out of date. We expect that the next release will include all the artifacts as we've been doing before 0.17.0.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif84_SgMV/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am new to kogito and I just followed the official site doc guiding examples. The only thing I change is deleting the first line `<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>` create by tooling. So the only difference between the two files is the first line `<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>`

so the two files will be:

Hmm I tried it again, it worked well too. I am sorry for wasting your time. Though I was pretty sure I deleted the line to make it work but now the fact shows the other case. I feel embarrassed. Now I doubt that I edited file in the intellij idea too, may be the vscode is initializing so the classpath hasn't loaded yet. Which I am not sure.

Though I am sure that the ""version"" prolog in the scesim file will cause the test fail: `[ERROR] testscenario.KogitoScenarioJunitActivatorTest  Time elapsed: 0.012 s  <<< ERROR!

I can't diagnose anything from the simple ""NoSuchElementException"".  Which element?

'I need to move the button for creating this element outside the editor itself, but so that when this button is pressed, this element is created inside the editor.'

Let me confirm if I understood correctly. You are using the embed DMN editor and want to create a button outside the editor (probably in the hosting page) and trigger an action for the editor. Did I understand you right?

take a sample datasets of JSON and attempt to derive the data types from the observed values across it's numerous records automatically. 

## Background:
I'm currently struggling with creating data types that match the data I load from the `Run`... 

Rather than records being loaded, I get a number of empty rows that match the row count of the input file. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, since there's no feedback in the UI or my kie-Sandbox podman container console.

Was thinking this could be much easier if the data types screen could have an ""Auto detect data type from sample JSON dataset file"", where I could feed it 10 to a 100 JSON records and let an algorithm observe what data types match for the values observed in each field.

I'm sure something like this is much easier said than done, but I think it would make getting started a *lot* easier.

- I created a Data type structure called `SimpleTX` (id,vendor,amount,description,category_id all of type `any`), created a `DMN Input Data` put it's data type properties to `SimpleTX`
- Next I uploaded JSON data, the data matches the structure of `SimpleTX`, however there's no mention of the Input name or data type in json records
```json
[{""id"":1,""amount"":1485.19,""category_id"":2,""vendor"":""Skaboo"",""description"":""Compactor""},
{""id"":2,""amount"":493.37,""category_id"":97,""vendor"":""Voolith"",""description"":""Backhoe""},
{""id"":3,""amount"":2855.0,""category_id"":80,""vendor"":""Gabspot"",""description"":""Scraper""}]
```
- This creates blank rows
- When I do a `Download inputs` my JSON looks like:
```json
[
  {
    ""InputData-1"": {},
    ""id"": 1,
    ""amount"": 1485.19,
    ""category_id"": 2,
    ""vendor"": ""Skaboo"",

This is my workspace:

Here is the data I sent to it:

I know the data is not the expected format; it should be a list of `InputData-1` objects rather than an `InputData-1` list, however this should result in an error message rather than an unrecoverable crash.

Here is the data that breaks things:
```json

I've also tried setting the field type to `date` and the data loads but it is not parsed as a date properly showing full string (and the date picker shows today's date when opened).

Here's the console message from the browser with info on the error:

I would expect that the prompt should only appear on following files: (`*.sw.json`, `*.sw.yaml`, `*.sw.yml`) - otherwise it is pretty annoying. Also why project settings instead of top vs code settings?

Once the prompt appears it doesn't go away until you decide on one of the 2 options provided (there is not even ignore option) or to be exact it reappears on switching between any tabs.

Doesn't look like our build has ever run on an arm64 Linux before. I occasionally develop on my M1 MacBook Air, which would be arm64 macOS, but I've never had such failures. Glad to know you were able to setup an amd64 VM.

Regarding the Java issue,  I have no idea what could be happening. We use OpenJDK 11 on our CI and I've never seen this error before. If you have access to another amd64 environment and could try and reproduce, maybe this would be a good start to finding the root cause.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif85H3AOi/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Like I said, I was able to build a Docker image to take the ARM out of the equation.  Then on the above java issue I thought maybe it was disk space, so I moved it to a place with more disk - it compiled for like an hour and dumped here (below)...maybe it is my Docker image causing issues, I will keep trying.

To enable the `Import Java Classes` button, you can refer to [my blog post in kie blog](https://blog.kie.org/2022/05/dmn-types-from-java-classes.html)

I can not make it work with 7.x nor with 8.x.. 
My process:
1. create project with ´mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=8.26.0.Beta´ (for 7.x I used archetype version 7.73.0.Final)
2. add Person class with public getter/setter to ´src/main/java/io/..´
3. add class with Annotation ´org.kie.api.project.KieActivator.KieActivator´ in same package as Person
4. run mvn package
5. add Person.dmn to _src/main/resources_

The Button stays disables, but with the new popup message. I've updated my reproducer, maybe you can see where I've missed something.

2. Completely empty, The file is being emptied when it is openend in visual studio.

I'm trying to make a reproduction video but it hasn't happened for I while now.

Reproduction steps are:
1. Close Visual Studio
2. Start Visual Studio
3. Open an existing BPM or DMN file from an open project. -> In some cases the contents of the file are being deleted on opening (filesize becomes 0 bytes) and an empty model is being shown.
4. If I restore the file from a back-up it will not be emptied again in the same session. However a close and restart of VS code my trigger the same behavoire again for that specific file.

It looks like it only happens with some of my DMN/BPMN files but I haven't found a pattern yet and it might be because I'm working more on those at that point in time.

But IMHO, that is the consequence of the issue, not the root cause.
It seems to me that the editor is trying to open an empty (0-byte) asset, so the deletion of the file content already occurred.
What you should discover is the exact moment when the file is emptied, and in particular:
- When do you close VSCode?
- When do you open VSCode?
You can use another external text editor (or just keep an eye on file properties) to understand when the deletion actually occurs.
In addition, I would check if other processes or tools are accessing the file.

So
for example:

File size before opening VS: 10Kb
File size after opening VS: 10Kb
File size after opening DMN model in VS: 0Kb

When I restore the DMN file afterwards (while keeping VS open) and reopen
it in the Kogito editor it won't empty the file anymore.
The deletion seems to be random; it doesn't happen on all files I open and
it's also not consistent on which models it happens.

Speaking of the DMN file, I noticed the following steps:
- You opened the DMN file.
- You modified it.
- You closed VSCode without saving the file
Now, VSCode has a mechanism that saves a copy of the unsaved file in a hidden directory in your user space, usually located here `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Code\Backups`. Said so, I expect to see a copy of your unsaved DMN assets there. 
According to the message you shared:
 `ERR Error: Cannot back up in this state: Cannot read properties of
undefined (reading 'getContent')
    at co.backup (mainThreadCustomEditors.ts:711:9)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections
(node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)
    at async workingCopyBackupTracker.ts:191:21`
Something wrong is happening during this phase, i.e during this backup phase. 
Now, as a next step, I would try to understand if the error is during the backup write or during the backup read.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif85QQ0_L/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It makes sense according to my previous comment ^^
So, I suppose that if you save the file before closing VSCode, the issue doesn't reproduce anymore, right?

This procedure works for mac-os, in Windows could be a bit different.
1. Go into `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Code/Backups` directory (in your `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Code\Backups`
2. Here, you should see a directory with a long alphanumeric name. Enter into that directory.
3. Here, you should see another directory `vscode-custom-editor`. Enter into that directory.
4. Here you should see a file. Open it with a text editor. This file contains metadata related to your vscode session, I guess. You should notice here the path of the original DMN file you opened.
5. In the file, please search for this key: `backupId`. That variable contains the actual location of the unsaved DMN file. Eg, in my case the path is: 
`""backupId"":""/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/5bfd610b760e5de8bbd37ecfaa736e6f/kie-group.vscode-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors/-14811927521""`
`-14811927521` is the unsaved DMN file.
6. At this point, I would ask you if that file exists, if it correctly contains the unsaved changes you applied to the file and the file read and write permissions.

Hope this can help to find the issue!

Am integrating kie  standalone in my application.
With Kie Standalone  we can create and download bpmn files,but I have a
requirement where I can open existing bpmn file and modify existing bpmn
file and commit the changes in git.

Hope you understand my requirement.

In standalone also am facing issues.

is throwing error as ""could not load existing sourcemap of

This error is because the command `mvn gwt:run` is being executed in the `kie-wb-common-stunner` root, but the root module doesn't contain itself a gwt app module. 

Just run the `mvn gwt:run` command in the [kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-kogito-runtime](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/tree/main/packages/stunner-editors/kie-wb-common-stunner/kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-kogito-runtime) root instead.

Sorry for the inconveniences, as I see the the [README](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/tree/main/packages/stunner-editors/kie-wb-common-stunner/kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-kogito-runtime#running-in-sdm) is not specifying to change the root. I am just going to create a PR to fix the readme :)

thank you for your question!

Some high level overview of the way forms works in Stunner:
there exist:
- [model classes](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/blob/e7cee444fe6cc55d47606e387ba49776da9c6f10/packages/stunner-editors/kie-wb-common-stunner/kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-api/src/main/java/org/kie/workbench/common/stunner/bpmn/definition/property/task/UserTaskExecutionSet.java): like Actors or Groupid -> those are storing the state for a field
- provider classes: populate the model
- renderer classes: renders the model in some way in the html (eg: by using custom renderer)

For Actors and Groups there is a bit difference because they share the same Form element.
Forms code is located [here](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/tree/4251fbbbc8f8d546a569be32462be709cc925eef/packages/stunner-editors/kie-wb-common-stunner/kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-client/src/main/java/org/kie/workbench/common/stunner/bpmn/client/forms/fields/assigneeEditor).
You can see `widget` package which actually a renderer and `*SearchService` which is doing what you actually need there.

Take a look at `search` method which is called by the Form element on load and populating predefined values. Just add values to [this collection](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/blob/4251fbbbc8f8d546a569be32462be709cc925eef/packages/stunner-editors/kie-wb-common-stunner/kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-client/src/main/java/org/kie/workbench/common/stunner/bpmn/client/forms/fields/assigneeEditor/AssigneeLocalSearchService.java#L55) and it should be it.

Let me know if you have any further questions, thank you!

I understand you're using the process editor in the Business Central. Please let me know otherwise.

In that case, as far as I remember, the `actors` and `groups` fields are actually consuming the users / groups from the `Users Management` subsystem. By default, if nothing configured, the subsystem reads the own wildfly realm (properties files). But you can configure it properly, by making the users management to consume your keycloak realm, instead of the properties files, so both fields will automatically be populated with the information from the keycloak server, no need for code customizations, it's just about configuring your workbench. 

For more information about how to configure the workbench users management see [1]

Also, you can find more detailed technical information about the security management and, in concrete, the keycloak security provider at  [2]

Please take a look at the updated [README](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/blob/main/packages/stunner-editors/kie-wb-common-stunner/kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-kogito-runtime/README.md) for running the bpmn editor showcase app. The configurations for making the app to run are quite simple, and they do apply also for latest IntelliJ IDEA versions (as we're internally also using it).

In general I am using these simple steps:
1.- Create new maven project by importing from [kie-wb-common-stunner](https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/tree/main/packages/stunner-editors/kie-wb-common-stunner) root (File -> Import project from existing sources -> choose maven project)
2.- Create the GWT run/app configuration as described in the README
3.- Right click on root folder -> maven -> reload project
4.- Menu Build -> Rebuild project
5.- Click on Run icon to start the GWT App configured in step 2

This way, all stunner and BPMN modules are part of the project, so you can change any file and hot reload plugin will detect properly.

In case you still are running into issues, can you please share more feedback in order to figure out what the issue is:
1. Share screenshots or info about with your GWT run/debug config
2. Share screenshots of info about the project structure

Let's keep in touch!

I am unable to import java classes. When typing the name of the class in the search box, no class appear.
In Developer tools I see following error:

```
dmn-loader.js:2 Error: Illegal char <:> at index 4: file://D:\src\drools\kogito-examples\kogito-quarkus-examples\dmn-quarkus-example\src\main\java\com\mc\Activator.java

    at e.receive (DmnEditorEnvelopeApp.js:2:521333)
    at eventListener.eventListener (DmnEditorEnvelopeApp.js:2:520493)
```

I was following this blog post entry https://blog.kie.org/2022/05/dmn-types-from-java-classes.html. I tried creating my own project and also cloned examples repository. Same issue on both.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. open https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-quarkus-examples/dmn-quarkus-example in VS Code
2. create Activator class:

```
package com;

import org.kie.api.project.KieActivator;

@KieActivator
public class Activator {
    
}
```

3. create java bean:

```
package com;

public class Person {
    String firstName;
    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }
}
```

4. Open Traffic Violation.dmn and try to search the Person class
5. In Developer tools Error: Illegal char <:> at index 4: error appears.

**Expected Behavior**

Plugin should be able to fetch my model classes.

we have one larger DMN which is using decision tables. It is slower and slower and after some investigation we think that it is caused by decision tables. Every field no matter if it is filled or not, is represented in XML as '-'. Then it grows and grows and if you have more inputs and rows, it grows quadratically.
I've tried to check and find where exactly is this solved but I'm not FE developer so it is hard for me.
Can you give me any hint if this is feature or bug/bad design? 
Thanks !

Yeah, I noticed the slowness opening that Decision Table. 
We have big plans to totally revisit that component in the near future: a refactoring of that component is currently in progress. The editor gives you the opportunity to test the new version of the component, in this way:
Above the Decision Table, you should see this section:
<img width=""908"" alt=""Screenshot 2022-10-15 at 13 23 48"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16005046/195983973-ae63545a-6e56-48b2-a230-2b40b500edf5.png"">
Press on the ""Click here"" link, and you will see the BETA version of the new component currently under development. You may notice that the slowness doesn't affect the new component.
In the next months, we plan to remove the current stable (and old) version with the new one.
You can learn more about the new component in this blog post https://blog.kie.org/2021/09/new-dmn-boxed-expression-editor-what-is-new.html

Despite this, my recommendation is to **_don't use_** the new Boxed Expression in production, because the component is still not mature, and not well integrated with the DMN Editor. 
Basically, the new component is still a work in progress and has not been properly tested.
Anyway, if this performance issue is critical for you and your organization's needs, you can refer to this [branch](https://github.com/yesamer/kie-tools/tree/KOGITO-6536). Building the DMN Editor with that branch will set the new component as the default one.

I'm playing with the new editor but it is still slow - I have troubles with even loading DMN to the editor. I've checked the memory consumption and it is accumulating during the load to a hundreds of MB and when it is loaded then it drops to ~ 100MB.
We've tested it on two computers and on newer CPU it is significantly faster (3x). Intel 8850H vs 11850H. I will continue with the investigation on my own but if you can point me to two locations - where is DMN XML parsed and where to turn off the old editor - it will save me some time.

Of course, the marshaller module requires performance optimization. We decided to increase the priority of this task, so the good news is we'll focus on this in the next few days.

I've worked on this issue further and I have two findings:

- If there is a huge hardcoded string as a feel expression, then the hashCode javascript function is extremely slow. We have ~ 20kB JSON string hardcoded for testing purposes and after a removal it is faster.
- Used GWT is old, there is a possibility to upgrade to version 2.10. When I did it (but I had to comment out stunner-editors\kie-wb-common-dmn\kie-wb-common-dmn-webapp-kogito-testing artifact because of classpath conflicts) I have more than 100% speedup

During my experiments, I didn't notice such a huge performance improvement. The tested scenario is: DMN Editor opening and DMN file loading.
Depending on the DMN assets size, (from 100 k to 1 MB ~) I observed no more than 1 / 2 seconds of improvement during the editor loading phase.

Imagine that I have a DRG with several decision and I decided to ""hide"" the decision complexity using DRDs.
So, I would design the DRG first, and then I would one by one add DRD for each DRG decision.

There is a quick and simple way, how to add a decision from DRG to a DRD - using DRD Actions (""share"" icon on the component), Create.

The problem is that on the DRG level you are not able to see to which DRD(s) is the DRG decision linked to. The only way how to ""drill down"" from DRG to the linked DRD is to go and search for the DRG decision name in Decision Navigator / Decision Graphs. In case you have tens or hundreds of DRDs, this becomes extremely user unfriendly (in the VS Code plugin, you cannot even use Ctrl+F to search in DRD list and you have to scroll through all Decision Graphs)

The situation is the same, if you use DRD decision in another DRD diagram.


**Suggestion:**

Add a list of all linked DRDs on the component in the editor.
If the user clicks on one of the DRDs in the list, it gets the user to the selected DRD.

Such list could be added as a new icon for the component in the editor or as part of the DRD Actions list.

An example of what I need to do, is to remove some properties from the properties panel that I don't need.

How do I go about doing this? What are the specific parts involved?

Will be great to add some dynamic search capability to the tables elements, or maybe enchance dropdown element to have search activity. 
When there are a lot of elements in table, like hundreds, it is getting very hard to find the row you need.

The internal table does not have a search, but we have an external component that has a search capability, see this example:

```
datasets:
    - uuid: gists
      url: https://api.github.com/gists
      cacheEnabled: true
      expression: >-
          $map($, function($v){
              [$v.created_at,$v.description,$v.files ~> $keys ~> $count]
          })
      columns:
          - id: Created            
          - id: Description
          - id: Total Files

                lookup:

But how I can add this external component to my local installation?
It seems to be using some new syntax?
In your example you have:
```
    - components:
          - displayer:
                component: table
                external:
                    height: 500px 
```

And I use what currently in the docs:
```
            components:
              - settings:
                  filter:
                    enabled: true
                    selfapply: true
                    notification: true
                    listening: true
                  table:
                    sort:
                      enabled: true
                      columnId: deployments_count
                      order: DESCENDING

The latest dashbuilder version include this component. It is external, but we provide it in the Dashbuilder bundle. Check the folder `dashbuilder/components` to see all components we provide:

```
[wsiqueir@localhost dashbuilder-client]$ ls dashbuilder/component/
echarts  map  svg-heatmap  table  timeseries  uniforms  victory-charts
```

There's a mention to the table component on documentation:

Before I was uisng https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve to run static server, and for some reason it was going to some kind of redirect loop with iframe pointing to external component. Replicating very easy just run `serve --cors`. When I replaced it with `http-server` which you recommend in npm docs it started loading table component.

However how I hit another issues. Data for some reson is not loading there 🤔 

I just copy pasted your example, even with gist data source, like this, it shows 0 records 🤔 
```
      - columns:
          - span: 12
            components:
              - settings:
                  component: table
                  lookup:
                    uuid: gists
```

If I make it standard table, data gets shown as expected:
```
      - columns:
          - span: 12
            components:
              - settings:
                  lookup:
                    uuid: gists
                  table:
```

I also tried running your yaml definitin as it is, and again it shows 0 records. 
How it performs transferring data to iframe, using some kind of `postMessage`? 

I have some 404 errors in http server logs, can it be related somehow?

In my understanding what you want to achieve is to have your own schema parsed and presented as a diagram using our canvas (Stunner).

In my analysis the main issue here is the parsers. At the moment they are pure java and annotation based so it won't work out of the box with your schema. To get it done you will have to implement your own parser and change Stunner's core to use it instead of original parsers.  In most of the cases temper with the core is not advisable for a number of reasons.

We are currently working to make Stunner plugable by exposing its APIs in javascript in order to make it more configurable. Definitely, it is something we are working to achieve. 

I say it is possible to be done, however, we are not there yet.  

It is important to say you are more than welcome to join us in the efforts to make a great open source SWF Editor.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif85h_4MY/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

No progress after 12 hours 🙂
No error, No message, nothing helpful.

**Additional Data**

I have used `ctrl+c` to stop build process. some errors has been shown:

I don't think of possible errors, I think that it is where build process is stopped.

Just sharing an idea for trying to identify a root cause. Can you please quickly try by dropping the whole local maven repo (although next build will take longer), or at least the artifacts for `org/jboss/errai/codegen` stuff? 

I am guessing that it may be some conflicts on resolution, as I can see both classes present in the source classpath for the `errai-codegen` module.

What do you link and dislike about the current Test scenario Editor? I think any information you can contribute will be helpful for us design a better experience moving forward.

In the last couple of months, we started the scesim-editor refactoring initiative, you can find more details in this ticket -> https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/453 
The initiative's scope is to create a new scesim-editor based on a modern technology stack (React + TS).
The first version of the new editor will provide limited support of RULE-based scesim, but our goal is to evolve that to fully restore it.
We don't have a precise ETA for the first version and its future evolution, you can track the progress relying on the ticket I previously posted.

Taking this into account, what would be the best way to upgrade without breaking other package dependencies? Maybe create a `uniforms-patternfly-1.0.0` branch and make the update? Later on link the dependency using branch resolution from `yarn` in the final consumers.

PatternFly is extensively used on KIE Tools. Pretty much everywhere. Such upgrade is usually treated as a Major change. We even have a ""Dependency consistency"" check that runs to make sure all packages are using the same versions of dependencies. 

There is, however, a way to bypass that. Adding an exception to `https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/blob/main/.syncpackrc.json` will allow a package to not be aligned with others.

I don't recommend doing that, though, as in practice, packages that depend on `uniforms-patternfly` and are still using PF4 will be mixing imports. CSS will probably get messy, and this needs to be thoroughly tested.

The literal expression can subsequently be used in a decision table header but not as a whole but by its values

Literal_Expression_1 has a data type which contains {code: string, name: string}
On the decision table header we have two columns for Literal_Expression_1.code and Literal_Expression_1.name

That's a missing feature we have, and we hope to address it as part of the new DMN Editor.

Please use below Steps to reproduce.
1. Add below dependencies in package.json
    ""@kie-tools-core/editor"": ""^0.31.0"",
    ""@kie-tools-core/i18n"": ""^0.31.0"",
    ""@kie-tools-core/workspace"": ""^0.31.0"",

    ""@kie-tools/kie-editors-standalone"": ""0.31.0"",
    ""@kie-tools/uniforms-patternfly"": ""^0.31.0"",
2. Run ""npm install""
3. Run ""ng serve""

Note: @kie-tools under node_modules directory is missing ""node_modules/@kie-tools/kie-editors-standalone/dist/jsdiagram"" directory which caused this failure at dmn/index.d.ts file.

Hope this helps.

I highly recommend that you try and create your experiments on top of the new codebase. It's not on `main` yet, but on my fork at the `dmn-editor` branch. 

If you really want to keep using the `stunner-editors` version, I guess you can try and see if there's an event that is fired when a node is selected on the Diagram. Maybe @yesamer or @danielzhe can help?

Are you planning on opening a PR or even publishing your work somewhere? I'm sure many people in the KIE community would love to see how we can leverage AI on the DMN Editor.

Good to hear from you - I've been impressed by how much of the source code was written by you as I’ve been working in it the last few weeks.

I’m aware of the editor re-write , and if you’re looking for contributors I’d be happy to help ( I have approximately 4 years of React experience) . 

However, a senior engineer at the company I work for advised me to go ahead and start building on the stunner editor as he states 
		- The new editor won’t be available for several more months at least  
               -  He is under the impression that while the ui aspect of the editor will be replaced with React, that all the logic/functionality will remain in Java. 

Is that correct ? 

Are you saying there’s enough of the React editor completed to begin building on top of it?

Yes, I am planning on eventually opening a PR or publishing the work !

I'm working together with @danielzhe and @ljmotta to have a PR open to `main` with the new Editor by the end of this week. If everything goes well, it should be merged in the following weeks. We've been testing it for a while now, and recently published it so we could get feedback from the community too. See: 

- https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/440
- https://tiagobento.github.io/prototypes/dmn-editor/

I can't talk about the priorities for the company you're working for, but I can tell you that we're not evolving the current GWT-based DMN Editor anymore. We'll only touch if extremely necessary.

As of the architecture of the new DMN Editor, there won't be any Java parts left. The entire new DMN Editor is built in TypeScript and React, using ReactFlow, Zustand, Immer, and PatternFly. We started from the ground up. See the new TypeScript-based marshaller at `packages/dmn-marshaller`.

As for contributions, you're more than welcome to help! Once the new DMN Editor lands on `main`, we'll start tracking issues here:

- We have a need for a DMN Visualizer to be used in our React web app. We do not need editing capabilities
- We evaluated the `kie-editors-standalone` as the DMN editor fits our needs, but the package was too large to be used in our architecture (UI served from S3 bucket but proxied through a Lambda that sits behind an ALB - resulting in 1MB limit per file sent to user's browser -- [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/lambda-functions.html#:~:text=The%20maximum%20size%20of%20the%20response%20JSON%20that%20the%20Lambda%20function%20can%20send%20is%201%20MB.))
- We learned of the React rewrite from this issue: #2034 and we plan to utilize this once it is complete
- In the meantime, after playing with the package, it looks to satisfy our needs in its current state. We are now looking into how we could use it. 

Main Questions
- What is needed to publish the existing state of the package to NPM to enable it to be pulled into a React UI? 
- Would it be possible to publish it in its current state as an Alpha build given it is not yet complete?
- Would you accept contributions to enable the package to be published in the near term?

We're confident that we're making a lot of improvements compared to the current one, and it looks like you and your team already found these improvements to help in your use case. Glad to hear that, and thanks for sharing.

As for your questions:
> - What is needed to publish the existing state of the package to NPM to enable it to be pulled into a React UI?

Right now, we're finalizing the big PR that will introduce the new DMN Editor to the `main` branch. We expect that this PR will be merged this week. After that, we're gonna have to wait for the next release of Apache KIE to happen, so the packages will finally land on NPM. Unfortunately, we're not be able to provide an exact date yet, as there's a lot of conversations going on and also there's a lot of people working on making the release automations stable enough for a big release after we moved the KIE community to Apache. What I can tell you is that we expect this release will happen in January 2024.

> - Would it be possible to publish it in its current state as an Alpha build given it is not yet complete?

From our side, no. In the past we used to run KIE Tools as a separate stream compared to other KIE projects, but after the migration to Apache, we won't do that anymore. Apache KIE will have a single release stream, and KIE Tools is the ""last piece of the puzzle"". As of now, we don't have ""dev""/""daily"" releases, unfortunately, but it is definitely something we're going to look at in the future, as our users might want to be able to assess ongoing experimental modules such as the new DMN Editor.

> - Would you accept contributions to enable the package to be published in the near term?

At this moment, given the complexity of the entire ecosystem and also because we are also learning how we can achieve this first release in as an Apache project, I think contributing might be very hard. What I would suggest is that you stay in the loop. Asking questions, making suggestions, or even requesting information are all things that add a lot of value to the community. Sometimes we end up not documenting parts of the process and the operation of the projects that might be relevant to people depending on it, like you.


----

I'm sorry if those answers are not what you were expecting to hear, but I'm certain the Apache KIE community will gradually evolve to reaching a state where users can have a very good understanding of its release strategy as well as making it possible for people to participate in a more active way. Including experimental components/modules.

In the mean time, if you really can't wait for the next release to be out, my suggestion to you would be publishing your own build of the DMN Editor, with a different scope/name and a `pre-release` version discriminator. Like `@your-org/dmn-editor-experimental@0.0.0-dev1` or something along these lines :)

Of course, once we do release it to NPM you can drop this temporary workaround and start depending on the Apache KIE package.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif85uTxrg/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I assume this is the PR you are referring to right? #2064 

That's great to hear that you are hoping to have it published in January, we had assumed it would be towards the end of the first half of 2024 which would have been too long for us to wait. 

Your note about contributions makes a lot of sense and we are interested in being involved going forward. Once the package is published and we can utilize it in our project, we'll be sure to post any feedback.

I'll discuss with my team in regards to publishing it ourselves for the time being, but I would say waiting until the end of January would be the best overall decision.

const fn = (field: string) => {

Then later on, the compatible fields can check whether the `DescriptionProvider` exists or not, and if so, use the provided function to retrieve the description.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif85ufvDJ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@lordrip Your proposal is a great addition. I prefer to stick with your solution but bring it inside the library instead of creating a custom bridge for it. Creating a `Provider` would create a new layer of complexity.

As the `description` field is a built-in `JSON Schema` field, it's very easy to support this feature without adding other components. What we need to do, is to change the `wrapField.tsx` to handle the `description` prop. We can do that by adding the `description` to the `WrapperProps` and then using it on the `labenIcon` of the `FormGroup` component.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif85wPmrk/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I was following this article (https://blog.kie.org/2022/05/dmn-types-from-java-classes.html) steps to enable the Import but it failed every time.

First I tried the last versions (as of this writing) of plugins:

- DMN Editor 0.32.0 & Language Support for Java 1.25.1

but, as the article + comments mentioned, there are some issues in 0.32.

Then I downgraded both to a combination from the comments:

- DMN Editor 0.31.0 & Language Support for Java 1.22.1

and using this github (https://github.com/yesamer/dmn-javaclasses-example) still didn't work. The error is:

```
Not available, please check if 'Language Support for Java by Red Hat' extension is correctly installed and the @KieActivator annotation is present

Then I changed the Activator.java with 2 things:

- Move it to `com.redhat` package
- Add the `@KieActivator` annotation

```java
package com.redhat;

import org.kie.api.project.KieActivator;

@KieActivator
public class Activator {

  
}
```

After a Language Server restart, it enables the button

But, I wasn't able to find any of the available classes (Book, Author):

I'm wondering what's happening there. In the logs you posted, the classes are correctly found and no error is thrown.
However, you just need to downgrade the DMN Editor to version 0.31.0, please use the latest version of the Java Language Extension.
With that setup, the example in my repository should work without any change (just tested in my local)
If the error persists in your local machine, please share your OS and VSCode version.
In that case, please check the WebConsole in VSCode (CTRL + P) -> Open WebView Developer tools if you notice any error.

The log confirms the request was correctly called and processed. 
That's very strange and hard to explain.
It behaves like you're using a very old version of our extension, despite I see you are using the 0.31.0 as I suggested.
Do you have a 1:1 copy of my repo, right?
Is DMN Editor the only installed extension that manages DMN files in your local?
Maybe you have the old Red Hat signed DMN Editor extension installed as well?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif85v-JMC/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

- Yes, your github as-is. I've started with that and then add the annotation, just to test.

- I do have only KIE DMN plugin, I used to use Red Hat version but as the project was discontinued I've changed to KIE. Even I did have other plugins for BPM and Serverless, but then I've uninstalled everything and just use the 2 I mentioned.

Maybe I have something wrong in my whole VSCode
I'll try to install vscode in a new environment and only installed those 2 plugins in I'll back to you.

kn deploy --namespace cli

We can see that the CLI produces the following command executions:

🛠 Deploying your SonataFlow project in namespace cli
configmap/01-multiplication-wf-resources created
**1)**  - ✅ Manifest 01-configmap_01-multiplication-wf-resources.yaml successfully deployed in namespace cli 
sonataflow.sonataflow.org/multiplication-wf created  **GOOD**
**2)**  - ✅ Manifest 01-sonataflow_multiplication-wf.yaml successfully deployed in namespace cli
configmap/02-multiplication-wf-resources created **NOT GOOD**
 **3)** - ✅ Manifest 02-configmap_02-multiplication-wf-resources.yaml successfully deployed in namespace cli
configmap/multiplication-wf-props configured **NOT GOOD**
**4)**  - ✅ Manifest 03-configmap_multiplication-wf-props.yaml successfully deployed in namespace cli **NOT GOOD**

The workflow is deployed and works, however, in the k8s management console we can see that two pods are created with their corresponding ReplicaSet.

After investigation, we can see that the workflow is being deployed before, some of the required resources. In particular, note that 03-configmap_multiplication-wf-props.yaml, which defines the workflow user properties is deployed last. Not good.

See explanation in the attached image.

The fix consists of applying the same resources, but, first all the config maps, and lastly the workflow.
**note:** the wf is undeployed, we must do in the reverse order, wf first, and configmaps after.

For the record, the issue can be reproduced if you generate the manifests, executing
 kn gen-manifest  --namespace cli

And then, doing kubectl apply one by one in order reported above.

The only way how to get URL is to get it from deployed services details with the command `kn service list ${SERVICE_NAME}`.

If you used SonataFlow plugin, there is no url printed to console log. You have to get it from deployed services details. For example `kn service list ${SERVICE_NAME}`.

HelloI have the same situation, here are the details:
I want to run the bpmn editor project locally.
I followed the instructions https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/blob/main/README.md#build-from-source

Start - pnpm bootstrap
Then I proceed https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/blob/main/README.md#build-from-source - I go to kie-editors-standalone and run pnpm start.
I get a lot of TypeScript errors and errors about missing files, I've attached a screenshot.

I've also attached a screenshot of the successful completion of pnpm bootstrap.
I didn't install some utilities, java/helm/make, but I don't think the problem lies in that.

I am trying to run the project locally for development.
Thank you.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/2186/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For `mvn clean compile quarkus:dev` I needed Docker runner (used Rancher Desktop with `export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.rd/docker.sock`) and it took a while to download some images. The first attempt failed but once the images were already downloaded my second attempt succeeded and I was able to create a process instance via Swagger UI.

It also happens with the light theme but it is more evident on the dark theme.

Note: check the VsCodeKieEditorController.ts file, it seems there are fixed background colors that may be one of the causes of the white flash.

@tiagobento I'm not sure it is the same issue or at least the way to reproduce it is not applicable to BMPN. On BPMN editor, if my memory is not tricking me,  we to not edit the XML directly so we don't have full reloads of the diagram once it's open, an incremental refresh is performed following commands execution context instead.  

Anyway, I updated the description of the issue above with the steps to reproduce the issue. 

@Josephblt Maybe you can perform a quick test to confirm it.  If you change the white background color to the same background color of the BPMN canvas in the file I mentioned above and the issue is gone that's it.

Please, let me know.

Of course we should have some sort of error or warning when multiple models with the same namespace are in the same ""context"" (in this case, an instance of the DMN Standalone Editor).

Since we're considering the development of the classic DMN Editor stopped right now, to make way for a new DMN Standalone Editor based on the new DMN Editor, I'm going to close this ticket, but will keep that in mind when developing the API for the new DMN Standalone Editor.

As I could see in `online-editor/importFromUrl`, it's possible to retrieve data from github or another git repo link, but not from an arbitrary folder of the web server. 

I've prepared script which is starting docker-compose with mapping project to 
```docker
  kie_sandbox:
    container_name: kie_sandbox
    volumes:
      - ${PROJECT_HOME}:/var/www/html/samples

and then starting this project and opening link in the browser:
```bash
start_project() {
  local project_home=${1:-$(pwd)}
  local dmn=$2
  local kie_port
  kie_port=$(get_kie_sandbox_port ""$ENV_PATH"")
  if [[ -z $kie_port ]]; then
    echo ""Error: Could not find KIE_SANDBOX_DISTRIBUTION__kieSandboxExposedPort in $ENV_PATH""
    exit 1
  fi
  # Start Docker Compose with the project home mapped to the container
  PROJECT_HOME=""$project_home"" docker-compose -f ""$DOCKER_COMPOSE_PATH"" --env-file ""$ENV_PATH"" up -d
  # Wait for the container to start
  wait_for_container kie_sandbox
  # Wait for the port to be exposed
  wait_for_port ""$kie_port""
  # Generate the HTTP link
  local link=""http://localhost:$kie_port/#/import?url=http://localhost:$kie_port/samples/$dmn""
  echo ""Opening $link in the default browser...""
  sleep 2
  # Open the link in the default browser
  if command -v xdg-open > /dev/null; then
    xdg-open ""$link""
  elif command -v open > /dev/null; then
    open ""$link""
  else
    echo ""Please open $link in your browser.""
  fi

It is really useful when you work with many small projects, so you can switch between projects. My focus here is not on opening samples in browser, but rather how to optimize my daily work by improving environment for many small projects - with ability to switch between many small projects, usually 3-10 dmn files (up to 150 in extreme cases, but for it I would rather use VSCode extension).

So I'm asking about a practical tool for local development when switching between contexts. I don't want to use a dedicated github repo with proxy, because 1) I have multiple small projects in the single monorepo. 2) I need a tool for local debugging and testing - it's usually 1-2 weeks of development and debugging without publishing.

I think the main issue with Kie toolbox - it's not designed for TDD and code-first development, but rather for UI editing. For complex logic with many variations, I need to maintain a large set of test cases which I want to run regular, plus ability to quickly spin-up project, check how it works with some corner cases.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif86A4iqO/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I've requested another option to load the current dmn context to the `kie-sandbox` by using command-line script. I'm working with many small projects and need to switch between them, so it's much more convenient just to load the project using `#/import` url, like I've shared in the previous post.
It is similar to using `git` or `gh` from command-line.

I'm using also some additional scripting to call `extended-service` to validate dmn model against predefined inputs, then compare with expected outputs, to use it with TDD. Also I have bunch of java code to integrate each dmn project with other services. So switching from code editor to Kogito UI would be much easier with such option I'm requesting.

Unfortunately Kogito was not designed with focus on many small projects to support easy integration and switching context between them, but for me it's a best way to use DMN in the real world use-cases.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif86A4mvk/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sure @tiagobento , here are our points.

> 
> 1. What is it that makes you prefer using KIE Sandbox rather than the VS Code Extension?
- Our entry-technical business users want to use Web UI to quickly adjust DRG/expression, and who will not use VS Code
- Testing expressions is not possible in VS Code, so Web UI much easier to use for learning how DMN works (focus on these entry-level technical business users).

> 2. Why not import your monorepo directly on KIE Sandbox?
- Some of projects contains 150 dmn files (one per country, total 25K rules), KIE Sandbox cannot render it. I found that we can use up to 7 DMN files loaded into KIE Sandbox
- But majority of other projects are smaller - usually request/response converter, types and 1-2 DMNs with decisions.

> 3. Would `.scesim` support on KIE Sandbox help you?
- Yes, for validation
- No, for interactive debugging and development by entry-technical business users

> 4. What is this tool you need for local debugging? What exactly are you debugging?
- Mostly routing logic between multiple DMN files - for standard cases like matching request to rule we generate DMN files, then need to check integration
- Types validation, testing processing all elements in array then combining into output, some priority conditions
- Exploring how to evaluate expressions like discounts/pricing, date-time conversions etc. (by entry-technical business users)

> 5. How do you run your application locally? `mvn quarkus:dev`? Or other?
- For initial development using KIE Sandbox, it's nice to check steps interactively
- For advanced-technical business users, `mvn quarkus:dev`, but it's just our team - too complex for other users
- For more complex setup, merged with generated DMNs - deploying to our `TEST` environment, then manual testing
 
> Thanks a lot in advance!
You're welcome!

P.S. `entry-technical business users` - these are usually offshore teams (several hundreds users) who maintain business departments, for them using Web UI is much easier than setting up a local DEV environments with VS Code.

@tiagobento  thanks for the update. may I know if there is some way to manually hide the tabs bar (even if not officially supported)? something like below.

I see that the editor is inside an iframe.
the iframe doc contains a script (which I guess is adding the contents of the editor to the doc).
the tabs bar element is one of the element in that content.
I tried using onload event of the iframe..  but the contents that are rendered by the script are not readily available then. Adding a  settimeout on top of it proved helpful.

The goal is to access the underlying file path from the API.

For instance, doing something like the following:
```ts
method() {

However, large files may exceed Kubernetes' [object size limit](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/db1990f48b92d603f469c1c89e2ad36da1b74846/test/integration/master/synthetic_master_test.go#L315) during deployment. Reference: [Kubernetes object size limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60468110/kubernetes-object-size-limitations).

To address this, we will introduce a new CLI command:

```shell
# Explore additional handlers if needed
kn workflow specs minify openapi
```

## Command Behavior:
- This command minifies OpenAPI spec files in the `specs` folder, keeping only the operations and definitions used in the workflows (and sub flows) within the project context.
-  Minified files will be saved with the pattern `<original-file-name>.min.yaml|json`.
- All unused operations, types, and objects will be removed from the minified file.

## Deployment:
- The `ConfigMaps` will reference the minified files when deploying to Kubernetes. Although the `ConfigMaps` entries will use the original file names (to match references in `spec.flow.functions`), the content will be the minified version.

## Automation:
- If the user does not run the minify command manually, the process will be triggered automatically before creating `ConfigMaps` during deployment. This ensures that oversized files do not block deployment.

## File Size Validation
- The minified file must be validated to ensure it does not exceed Kubernetes' 3MB size limit. If it does, users will be prompted to store the OpenAPI files remotely (e.g., via CDN or a Git repository) and reference them using HTTP(S) URLs in the project.

## Debugging:
- The command allows users to manually minify and inspect the OpenAPI specs, offering better debugging and verification before deployment.

## Documentation:
- Ensure all relevant documentation is updated to reflect this new behavior.

## Additional Considerations:
**Editor Integration**: @handreyrc, please verify if this change impacts the editor's functionality. IntelliSense should remain unaffected, as it will continue working with the original, non-minified OpenAPI specs.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/2601/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The objective is to unify the codebases to simplify maintenance and improve CI processes. The migration will occur in two phases, starting with `kogito-images`, followed by the `kogito-serverless-operator`.

### Tasks Overview

#### Create Migration Branch in `incubator-kie-tools`
- Create a new branch from the main in the `incubator-kie-tools` repository.
- Delete unnecessary packages from the new branch.
- Commit the changes to the `incubator-kie-tools` repo.

#### Prepare `kogito-images` for Migration
- Checkout the `kogito-images` repository on main.
- Delete the existing content but do not commit the changes.
- Copy relevant packages from `kie-tools@main` (POC) to `kogito-images`.

#### Merge Histories and Repositories
- Commit the copied packages in `kogito-images`.
- Add `kogito-images` as a remote in the `kie-tools` repository (local directory is sufficient).
- Merge with `--allow-unrelated-histories` to integrate `kogito-images` into kie-tools.
- Open Pull Request for `kogito-images` Migration

#### Open a PR in `incubator-kie-tools` for the merged changes.
- Ensure proper documentation and review notes are included.
- CI Integration and Testing for kogito-images

#### Review the CI configuration in `incubator-kie-tools`.
- Ensure the newly integrated packages are correctly tested and validated in the CI pipeline.
- Close PRs and Fix End-to-End Tests for kogito-serverless-operator
- Review and close all open PRs in the `kogito-serverless-operator` repository.
- Investigate and fix any issues in the end-to-end tests to ensure complete test coverage.

#### Migrate kogito-serverless-operator
- Repeat the migration steps (branch creation, package deletion, copying, and merging) for the `kogito-serverless-operator` repository.
- Follow the same process as used for `kogito-images`.

#### Final CI Validation and Cleanup
- Evaluate the entire CI pipeline after both migrations.
- Identify and fix any CI issues, ensuring all workflows are functional.
- Review the migration and validate the final setup, ensuring all packages and history are successfully transferred.

#### Kogito Images and Operator Sunset
- Properly communicate with the Apache community about the upcoming changes in those repositories
- Ask Apache Infra to archive the repositories

However, a common use case has emerged where users need to patch the generated SonataFlow CR to mount a **secret** into the pod, making environment variables available to the workflow's application.

To streamline this process, we propose extending the kn-workflow plugin with the ability to Generate Kubernetes Secret from **secret.properties files,** while ensuring proper resource ordering. We will also update the plugin documentation and will provide examples.

**Steps to replicate:**
https://github.com/dmarrazzo/swf-simple-order

1. start callback_state_timeouts
2. instance page > workflow instance
3. the page is empty
4. wait 30 seconds (timeout goes off)
5. now the workflow instance is completed
6. the detailed page works as expected!

**Debug information:**
The working DI answer is:
```
{
    ""data"": {
        ""ProcessInstances"": [
            {
                ""id"": ""531ca071-8c28-46ae-b93a-7e95c6883bbc"",
                ""processId"": ""callback_state_timeouts"",

                ""businessKey"": null,
                ""parentProcessInstanceId"": null,

                ""end"": null,
...
```

The one with which give the empty page has this property:
`                ""variables"": null,`

Just a value like this would work for the UI:
`               ""variables"": {},`

In fact, if I run the callback_state_timeouts workflow with simple data like this, the UI works:
`{""a"":""b""}`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/2654/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to: https://start.kubesmarts.org/dev
2. Setup an OpenShift connection with DevMode
3. Create a workflow using https://github.com/dmarrazzo/swf-simple-order/blob/main/src/main/resources/timeout.sw.yaml
4. Upload the workflow to OpenShift in DevMode
5. Start the workflow and quickly move to the next step
6. Open the workflow details and view the Jobs list
7. Observe that the job shows ""expires in a few seconds"" (see screenshot 1)
8. Wait a few minutes after the expiration time
9. Observe that the job expiration changes to ""expires in NN minutes"" and the status remains as ""scheduled"" (see screenshot 2)

### Expected Result
The jobs list should refresh after the job expiration.

### Actual Result
After expiration, the jobs list shows ""expires in NN minutes"" and the status remains ""scheduled"" even after expiration.

I would like to ask a few questions as follows:
- Can KIE Sandbox or VSCode use test scenarios on the UI like KIE Workbench? From my understanding, it seems that only ""Maven build"" can be used to test all the test cases defined inside *.scesim files.
- Does VSCode have any extensions that support reading the GDST file format?
- Is it possible to run a single Kogito project in two modes simultaneously, using both Kogito with legacy API support and DMN Kogito artifacts within the same project? Specifically:
	+ The old rules written in DRL would be executed using KieRuntimeBuilder (legacy API).
	+ The new rules would be handled using DMN with Kogito artifacts.
	+ The results from both approaches would then be combined into a unified output.
	-> If this setup is feasible, what would be the best practices or recommended way to configure the project to achieve this?

Correct, not button **Run** available in VSCode. To run your scesim file you need to run the maven command.

No

It seems we have three issues with the same root cause:
- https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/2759
- https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/2670
- https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/387

I wanted to ask what is your idea about refactoring the settings modal to be single property **Href** / **Url**. From my point of view it would be more aligned with the environment property configuration **KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL**

Here I share how it would look like and also attaching log from the browser log, where correct ping is executed (it is red because I didn't have extended services running on such address).
### Href/URL single setting
![Screenshot 2024-11-28 102735](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06961c4b-5d9b-4fea-853d-b5b846b64059)
### Browser console log

With similar change, we should also think, if the advanced settings of the extended services wizard in the current form makes sense.

### Advanced settings extended services wizard

the problem is all that part from screenshot does not take into an account a case, when the url has a form:
`[host][port][pathname]: http://localhost:21345/my-extended-services/`
it assumes only:
`[host][port]: http://localhost:21345/`

Currently, the Web Tools web application uses [a very close image](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/tree/main/packages/serverless-logic-web-tools-swf-dev-mode-image) to the [sonataflow-devmode-image](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/tree/main/packages/sonataflow-devmode-image). We should unify them into one and use the very same on the operator and web tools side.

## Goals
1. Make the SonataFlow Operator Web Tools image to share the same Quarkus Devmode image
2. Disable the zip upload feature on the Operator side to avoid a security breach

## Motivation
We should unify these images since the operator and web tools share the same requirements. One image serving both tools would increase our maintainability and resource use.

## Description
The `serverless-logic-web-tools-swf-dev-mode-image` has a backdoor that the web tools use to update the project files via a ZIP structure. To avoid security breaches, this backdoor must be disabled by default and only enabled by the Web Tools when refreshing the application.

After this work, we can safely remove one of the packages to save build and maintenance resources.

## Testing
The exact use case offered today by the web tools and the operator Operator continues to work.

1. Deploy one workflow with Web Tools, check the running status, and if it creates a workflow instance without any occurrences
2. Repeat the process with the OperatorOperatortcome must be the same

## Risks
Fail to turn off the ZIP backdoor on the Operator deployment.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/2762/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

-----

When an `eventRef` is defined for an `action` in sonataflow, editor display the reference as undefined when hovering over the icon connected to this. Notably there is some behavior if I use older definitions, probably deprecated syntax now.

*Environment*
-----
VSCode extension on Linux

*Steps to reproduce*
-----
1. Import
[OLD_SYNTAX-event-based-service-invocation.sw.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17931199/OLD_SYNTAX-event-based-service-invocation.sw.json)
2. Hover over the icon and see `Action: eventRef: VetAppointmentInfo` AND the file is not syntactically correct as per VSCode syntax checker
3. Open [eventWf.sw.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17931279/eventWf.sw.json)
4. Hover over the icon and see `Action: eventRef: undefined` AND the file is syntactically correct

*Actual results*
-----
Hover over the icon and see `Action: eventRef: undefined`

*Expected results*
-----
Hover over the icon and see `Action: eventRef: VetAppointmentInfo`
OR
Potentially show both `triggerEventRef` and `resultEventRef` for the state.

*Testing*
-----
Manual verification is sufficient for this case.

-----

Longer inputs are not truncated with three dots `longerInp...`. Idea is to truncate for better viewing experience. Very minor enhancement, but should be somehow applied globally as a rule/policy.

*Environment*
-----
VSCode 


*Steps to reproduce*
-----
1. Open in vscode: [eventWf.sw.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17931636/eventWf.sw.json)
2. Hover over icons of parallel state

*Actual results*

*Expected results*
-----
Output is truncated in a readable and UX acceptable way.

*Testing*
-----
Manual verification of this is enough.

It would be nice to externalize this functionality to be available as a automated step during a build pipeline (eg. maven).
So we don't need to first do it manually as developers and also don't need to check in generated code.
Also currently when we don't generate the SVG manually, the SVG endpoint (for example used by the management console) then doesn't/can't give a SVG as response (as of my understanding).

For a simple solution the functionality to generate the SVG from a BPMN file path could be externalized to a own npm package.
This package could then be used in maven via the [frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin).

Major e2e tests on the images side have the debug flag set to `SCRIPT_DEBUG=true`. This environment variable turns on the `set—x` flag for every bash script running in that context. On my local tests, this considerably improves the logging and time to spin up the image container (sometimes 20x).

### Steps to Reproduce
Followed the official instructions for installing Playwright dependencies (https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#step-1-bootstrap) with the following command:
   ```bash
   PLAYWRIGHT_BASE__installDeps=true pnpm bootstrap

The SonataFlow Operator goes into CrashLoopBackOff when workflow is deployed with cluster platform referenced platform.

How reproducible: 100%

Steps to reproduce:

1. Deploy Sonataflow Operator on OCP v4.14.0 using image from local build on the main branch and check that the operator is running.
2. Create two namespaces sonataflow-infra and test.
3. Deploy a sonatafowplatform using the attached yaml file.
[sonataflowplatform.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18370256/sonataflowplatform.txt)
4. Deploy a sonatafowclusterplatform using the attached yaml file.
[sonataflowclusterplatform.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18370258/sonataflowclusterplatform.txt)
5. Deploy the greeting workflow using the attached yaml file in the test namespace.
[greeting.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18370259/greeting.txt)
6. Wait until the workflow build is completed.

Actual results: the operator loop goes into CrashLoopBackOff after a few minutes:
oc get pods -n openshift-serverless-logic 
NAME                                                       READY   STATUS             RESTARTS        AGE
logic-operator-rhel8-controller-manager-64d748755f-792s8   1/2     CrashLoopBackOff   380 (84s ago)   43h

Expected results: The greeting workflow should get deployed normally and the operator pod should continute to run.

It appears to have a stackoverflow, see logs attached. Note that the log level was set to debug

This is incorrect. This issue was present in the TCK suite as well. It was addressed here https://github.com/dmn-tck/tck/pull/423

The modelling of BKMs, without using the function type, can be done as follows:
- typeRef of variable and encapsulatedLogic is undefined
- typeRef of the parameter is defined (e.g. boolean)
- typeRef of the expression that represents the body of the BKM is set ()
- the type of the BKM is inferred from the above parts

An example is here https://github.com/dmn-tck/tck/blob/master/TestCases/compliance-level-3/0087-chapter-11-example/0087-chapter-11-example.dmn#L343

Currently, the DMN editor does not allow the specification of the type of the body, but it allows the specification of the types of the parameters.

To comply with the standard we need to have at least one feature:
- support function types or
- be able to specify the typeRef of the body of the BKM

I’ve been trying the standalone editor and looking at how it handles large models with hundreds of nodes. Whilst it’s doing a great job at rendering everything, any interaction with the editor such as zooming in and out is quite slow. This is expected as react flow is DOM based and there have been similar questions in their space [1, 2].

The react flow developers seem to suggest canvas based solution for large visualisations [2]. 

I was wondering if you have plans to switch to a canvas based solution for the editor or is the assumption that the DMN models are not manageable when those have hundreds/thousands of nodes?

Thank you in advance

I tried to make the experience somewhat usable for ~500 nodes and ~500 edges on a M1 Pro MacBook, but maybe we need more than that...

If you *could* share 60fps videos of your experience (you can scramble the data or use mocks), it would be awesome to understand more, as we didn't invest too much time on performance benchmarking, but I'd love to help you overcome the limitations you're currently facing.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-kie-tools/issues/comments/IC_kwDOC6Zif86cJG1_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

> DMN Editor (You're using the new one, right? 😅)

I believe so 😄 I used this https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/bamoe-standalone-dmn-editor . 

I was interested to use the dmn-editor package, but it is not published to npm yet, I see you have  https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1717 for this.

Of course! I’ll prepare a mock DMN model and try to share it here as well. I have tried the same setup on a M2 Pro MacBook and it’s better, but still slightly laggy when I fit the whole model on the screen (expected as everything has to render). However, there’s a bigger impact for a use case I was evaluating where this’s accessed on a windows remote server with CPU integrated graphics and a less powerful CPU using virtual desktop infrastructure. I’ll check this week and try to add a screen recording.

Edit

Looking at https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1717 it seems that I’m loading the standalone editor from the wrong place, should have used https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kie-tools/kie-editors-standalone instead. I’ll test with this package and report the results, my bad.

I might be misunderstanding something here, I’m loading https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.1.x?topic=tools-dmn-bpmn-editors-javascript-libraries#_new_dmn_editor which matches the use of the react flow that I see in here https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/blob/main/packages/dmn-editor/package.json#L58 . However, this https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kie-tools/kie-editors-standalone is loading the old canvas based editor.

Am I looking at the wrong thing?

How exciting!  I'm diving into using the new DMN editor right now.

Do you all have plans to publish the new extensions to the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/)?  The environments I typically work in are based on VS Code, but not VS Code itself so I rely on extensions being available at Open VSX.

I *think* I could technically do this myself(?), but I wanted to check to see if you all have plans for this already.

Happy to jump in and help make it happen if that's appropriate as well!

- https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-4349
- https://open-vsx.org/extension/kie-group/vscode-extension-kogito-bundle

So I believe we could do it and your offer for the help will be much appreciated. I am not expert in the Open VSX registry, I think we just need to discuss details, for example the account used for uploading is something I am not sure about.

@ederign @tiagobento you as very senior engineers were involved in this previously (I assume this from tickets and open vsx portal), would you mind to advise how to proceed?

Thanks for the interest on the Apache KIE VS Code Extensions 😊 Since the move to Apache we're trying to make things simpler, and publishing to Open VSX was something we decided not to do to expedite the release, but AFAIK we don't have any impediment preventing us from publishing there, it was just an optimization we did given the complexity of our releases already.
