That's why we try to get a defined order by introducing an internal variable referencing all user variables in the desired order and put this one first in the setup.
But even with this approach, the variables that are used in filters (bold label) are automatically placed. The same for variables inside conditional containers.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf385o4SC4/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I assume that file really does not exist, correct?

Unfortunately Windows anti-virus can block files being moved/renamed leading to problems like this one.  If a second attempt to installs fails in this same way, then you need to try to repair the bundle pool to fix this missing/broken artifact as described here:

https://www.eclipse.org/setups/installer/question/

Specifically the latest sentence here is relevant:

> Use the eclipse installer's Bundle Pools... menu item to manage where this pool is physically located on disk; this location can become large. The Bundle Pool Management dialog supports garbage collecting of unused artifacts, i.e., if you delete an installation, the artifacts it uses can potentially be removed from disk. In addition, if some artifact becomes corrupted, or if a corrupted artifact is downloaded from some mirror site, this dialog can be used to detect the damage and to repair it.

For simplicity to find the way through, I'm using some local web server where I can either disable SSL, or have some self-signed certificate at hand only. The idea here is to learn what it needs before I ask our infra to provide a proper SSL enabled web server.

While making good progress with http repositories using Oomph up to version 1.28.0, Oomph version since 1.29.0 silently switches to https, and fails because of missing proper SSL setup in that local web server:

- Disabling SSL leads to 'Connection refused' at https port 443,
- Enabling SSL using self-signed certificate leads to 'unable to find valid certification path to requested target', because I don't use some public certification authority.

While I understand the motivation behind forcing https everywhere, either I need some option to disable that silent change to https, or I need some option to accept my self-signed certificate.

Switching to advanced mode **without** copying to persistent location seems to not restart (arguments are still available), after copying, arguments are lost.
The missing entries in eclipse-inst.ini can be observed already in the eoi*.tmp directory in simple mode, without switching at all.
It appears to become a problem only when switching to the persistent location.

as part of the [Eclipse WG imitative to supporting secured installation layouts for eclipse](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/18), it was decided that the most safe way seems to install eclipse in a read-only way so probably only elevated administration user can modify the original install of eclipse (especially placing new file in the root of eclipse what might be a source of [DLL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection) or replacing the `eclipse.exe`  and similar treats.

Oompf should therefore help the user to make things more secured by the following ways

1. If installed a product it should make sure that the folder and its files are only writable by that user for example using [NIO Path API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#setPosixFilePermissions-java.nio.file.Path-java.util.Set-) if that is not possible we might want to warn the user about this insecurity
2. There might be an option to make the install even **readonly** for this purpose the product has to be started once with `-initialize` and then can be made readonly as described [here](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/multi_user_installs.html?cp=2_1_6_7). Even though eclipse chooses a default of `<user-home-dir>/.eclipse/<product-id>_<product-version>/configuration` for the private user part, this might be configurable as well for the convenience of the user.
3. There might even be an option to create a **shared install** the main difference is that the product will not installed with user-right but _elevated rights_ that make the install read only and even not modifiable by the current user account. This is the most complex because it will require integration with the native operation system way of requesting elevated permissions but thanks to [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/442) even that would be solvable from java

Option 1+2 seem quite straight forward, but still have one flaw: If my user account get compromised even for a short time (e.g. forget to logout while taking a coffee) my eclipse might get compromised even though of course this opens up for much more serve security problems. Option 3 is the most complex but what one today might expect from modern installers, especially in managed environments.

I have used shared-installs (manually configured of course) in the past for supporting Windows-Terminal Server, so even beside the security aspect supporting shared-installs would be great for the users (or more their admins).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/34/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

```
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<org.eclipse.ui.commands>
<keyBinding contextId=""org.eclipse.ui.textEditorScope"" keyConfigurationId=""org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration"" keySequence=""CTRL+SHIFT+F""/>

</org.eclipse.ui.commands>
```

I'm surprised that there is an entry:
```
<keyBinding contextId=""org.eclipse.ui.textEditorScope"" keyConfigurationId=""org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration"" keySequence=""CTRL+SHIFT+F""/>
```

IIUIC correctly, then this entry is responsible for unbinding the pre-existing key binding.  The surprising part is that it does not mention _which_ binding exactly to remove.  For example, it is possible that multiple bindings for this key-combination exists in the same scope.  

OK, nevermind, let's continue and try to use this recorded change. 

I revert the updated key bindings by pushing `Restore Defaults` in the `Keys` tab of the  `Preference` window.  

Now, I try to re-apply my recorded key bindings.  I do `Perform setup tasks`.

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/assets/813926/cfd01e81-767f-4cd9-8ecc-8743f133dfde)

There is no key binding for `Format`.  What is more, there is no key binding either for `Go to Symbol in File`, `Go to Symbol in Work` ...  They seem to have disappeared.  Note that not all key bindings have disappeared.  Most remain.

For future reference, I learned stuff:

* One doesn't seem able to remove a key binding using a ""key binding"" task.  You can only add bindings.
* The underlying Eclipse key binding API seems flawed. `org.eclipse.jface.bindings.Binding` explains that you remove a key binding by registering a new binding that omits a command.  The problem is that this interface does not allow you to specifically say which binding needs to be removed: there could be multiple key bindings in the same scheme/context for the same key. It seems this interface will just randomly unbind one of possibly many bindings because the interface doesn't know which command is supposed to be unbound from the key.  That API also explains why the recorder sometimes registers multiple `keyBinding contextId=""..."" keyConfigurationId=""..."" keySequence=""...""` operations.  I guess that the Preference dialog is just iterating through all the bindings of a key until it finally deletes the specific one you are trying to unbind.

Unfortunately I have not yet been able to reproduce this with a platform IDE or similar, but only with IDEs for a custom setup in our company. Therefore I'm not sure if the issue is valid, or if we have to eventually edit something in our company Oomph setup instead.

I guess the offending part in the setup file is the container here, which has been unchanged since years.

As you see, no matter what I added as requirements `com.google.guava`,  `org.eclipse.emf.common` and `org.eclipse.emf.edit` (I tried also as `extraUnits`) these units are not part of the generated target definition file...

am I doing anything wrong?

By the way, those 3 bundles are required for one of the projects imported in the workspace, so Oomph correctly puts them in the modular target platform, but not in the generated target file...

Thank you @merks , these did the trick `generateImplicitUnits=true, minimizeImplicitUnits =false`

On a side note: I've just discovered that I can use a ""planner"" TP for RAP as well! In the past, I was including too many features in the TP (namely `org.eclipse.emf.cdo.feature.group` and `org.eclipse.net4j.feature.group`): these used to generate conflicts between RAP UI and RCP UI. But removing those features (not needed in the TP anyway), allows me to use ""planner"" and forget about the nightmares of ""slider"" :)

If you did the same but install a 2023-09 the new Instance comes up automatically.

I found the following workaround.

```
  public Process execute(List<String> command, boolean terminal) throws Exception
  {
    ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder(command);
    try
    {
      Map<String, String> environment = processBuilder.environment();
      environment.remove(""SWT_GTK3""); //$NON-NLS-1$
    }
    catch (UnsupportedOperationException ex)
    {
      // Ignore.
    }

    Process process = processBuilder.start();
    process.getInputStream().close();
    process.getOutputStream().close();
    process.getErrorStream().close();
    return process;
  }
```
If you insert `    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);`
after `    Process process = processBuilder.start();`but before `process.getErrorStream().close();`
you can start a 2023-12 installation

I did investigate how Oomph could support it but I think it would be a large change (although I'm not familiar at all with the codebase). It seems that the MavenProjectFactory (which extends XMLProjectFactory) only accepts a single file name, `pom.xml` in Maven's case. The issue is that Tycho generates many files that are equivalent to pom.xml, such as

pom.tycho
.polyglot.pom.tycho
.polyglot.META-INF
.polyglot.feature.xml

etc.

So either you have to create a factory for each of them, or modify the project factory system to allow a list of files to be given that are equivalent.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf385up7aR/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

But m2e is able to import them despite the files not being there (I think they must do something to temporarily create them).

I've debugged this and during the Maven import task we do get these projects (because m2e knows about it), but then the MavenProjectFactory only knows to look for pom.xml so the other ones are filtered.

`org.eclipse.oomph.resources.impl.XMLProjectFactoryImpl.doCreateProject(BackendContainer, BackendContainer, IProgressMonitor)`

```java
  @Override
  public final IProject doCreateProject(BackendContainer rootContainer, BackendContainer backendContainer, IProgressMonitor monitor)
  {
    IPath xmlFilePath = new Path(getXMLFileName());
    BackendFile xmlFile = null;

    try
    {
      xmlFile = backendContainer.getFile(xmlFilePath);

      byte[] bytes = xmlFile.getContentBytes(monitor);
      if (bytes.length > 0)
      {
        ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);
        DocumentBuilder documentBuilder = XMLUtil.createDocumentBuilder();
        Element rootElement = XMLUtil.loadRootElement(documentBuilder, bais);

        Description description = new Description(backendContainer);
        fillDescription(description, rootElement);

        return new ExternalProject(backendContainer, description);
      }
    }
    catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
    {
      //$FALL-THROUGH$
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
      String message = NLS.bind(Messages.XMLProjectFactoryImpl_ProblemParsing_exception, xmlFile != null ? xmlFile : xmlFilePath);
      ResourcesPlugin.INSTANCE.log(new Exception(message, ex));
    }

    return null;
  }
```

The XMLProjectFactory tries to find a file in the project for import. For Maven projects, `getXMLFileName()` returns `pom.xml`, and so `null` is returned since that file doesn't exist.

So my potential solutions would be:
1. Modify `XMLProjectFactory` to allow multiple filenames to search if one isn't found. Something like
```java
IPath xmlFilePath = null;
for (var filename : getXMLFileNames()) {
    xmlFilePath = new Path(filename);
    if (xmlFilePath.toFile().exists()) {
        break;
    }
}
...
```
2. Create a project factory for Tycho that knows about these files, similar to above but without modifying the original XMLProjectFactory. You could maybe get m2e to help the factory figure out what the appropriate file is (because there can be many e.g., `.polyglot.META-INF`, `.polyglot.feature.xml`, etc).


My first solution is probably better because they still are xml files, so we can benefit from the xml resource loading that the factory already does. We just have to teach it about different file names besides `pom.xml`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf385u6NUy/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For instance, a setup-file can be downloaded using such an URL https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/ease/ease/-/raw/main/releng/org.eclipse.ease.releng/oomph/ease.setup

But it doesn't work for private GitLab repositories.

It seems that GitLab doesn't support basic authentication. Here is [an open issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/19189).
And also basic authentication is not mentioned in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/).

So the following URL will not work:
https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/ease/ease/-/raw/main/releng/org.eclipse.ease.releng/oomph/ease.setup?oomph_basic_auth=true

GitLab will redirect to an HTML login form.

It's possible to clone a Git repository using ACCESS_TOKEN:
```
git clone https://oauth2:ACCESS_TOKEN@gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/ease/ease.git
```

But it seems that it's impossible to use such an URL to download a specific file.

Probably the only way to download a file from a private GitLab repository is to use [Files API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html). In that case the followin URL should be used (you can ommit ACCESS_TOKEN if a repository allows anonymous access):
https://gitlab.eclipse.org/api/v4/projects/3814/repository/files/releng%2Forg.eclipse.ease.releng%2Foomph%2Fease.setup/raw?private_token=ACCESS_TOKEN

```

I guess the cause is a wrong file name - raw (because the last segment of URL is raw). The file doesn't have setup extension.

It also seems that not all versions of GitLab returns correct HTTP headers:

```
Content-Disposition: inline; filename=blob
X-Gitlab-File-Name: ease.setup
```

`Content-Disposition` header should contain a valid file name.

Probably one of the ways to fix the problem is to register a Setup Resource Factory as a fallback one.

Hi,
We have configuration in our git clone tasks to add additional ref spec to a particular origin (for Gerrit purposes), it looks like:
![image](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/assets/35498448/32b23012-2f24-428d-8be7-cd18e5a76581)

A couple of weeks ago developers started noticing that the ""Fetch from Gerrit..."" option was not available anymore for newly provisioned workspaces. In the new git clones, only the first fetch refspec is added to the git repository config file instead of both of them. To be explicit, the relevant section in the config file looks like:
```
[remote ""origin""]
	url = ssh://gerrit:29418/repo
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	pushurl = ssh://gerrit:29418/repo
	push = HEAD:refs/for/main
```
Instead of:
```
[remote ""origin""]
	url = ssh://gerrit:29418/repo
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	fetch = refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*
	pushurl = ssh://gerrit:29418/repo
	push = HEAD:refs/for/main
```

I noted that there have been some changes to the git Oomph plugins recently so was wondering how we might achieve the previous behaviour?</div>","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/68/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The enhancement added two new parameters ""force"" and ""recursive"" to the configuration entries.

Using the ""force"" parameter does appear to restore the previous behaviour.

I'm not sure where that leaves this issue. I can't think of a better term than ""force"" but at the same time it's not entirely clear what the implications are especially for configs such as the fetch refspecs.

Perhaps this is a non-issue then, unless it is likely to affect many users that the default behaviour has changed?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf385zwO1_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I’ll have a closer look too. The idea for force is to add/change the property only if not already present.

It looks like probably you are trying to update the confirmation at the point in time when there is already a fetch property and indeed in that case an additional fetch config property will not be added except when there is a force.

The design intent is that one can specify properties in such a way that they do not change the user's configuration if the user has configured that already or differently.   Also the implementation was changed (improved) so that changes to the configuration will be applied by the git clone task when next performed (and makes it need to perform) whereas previously such changes were applied only when the clone is first created.  In addition, a new task was created that allows the user to apply configuration changes to arbitrary git clone tasks defined in setups, e.g., the following allows me to create an additional remote for my fork of some other arbitrary GitHub repository:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/assets/208716/54a35119-2fb2-408a-92b1-efdd09a866eb)

Here I don't want to force the url property on the off chance that my fork's name is not the same as the original repository's name, e.g., if I clone such .github repository which each Eclipse GitHub organization has.

This is a long winded way of saying that I think it is working correctly as designed and it is an unfortunate side-effect that you now need to set the force property to get the old behavior.  I suppose I could change the default value to true, but I think it's more typically best to respect a user's existing configuration.

To some extent it could be argued that certain properties should be considered as _not_ already set if the configuration is applied to a git clone task (rather than applied by the new git configuration task) as they haven't been specified explicitly in any Oomph setup task, but implicitly by EGit upon clone. However I don't know if this would provide a more intuitive or consistent approach overall (and it might not even be possible to implement).

The design description you have outlined above does make sense and I agree with the intent.

Possibly if there are some docs/hints/tips for the clone task it might be helpful to include something about these implicit/default Git/EGit config keys that will now require use of force?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf3850iteP/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This takes about an hour to complete (because mac notarization of the installers takes really long).

In this example ([org.eclipse.setup.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/files/14791180/org.eclipse.setup.zip)) the `my.feature1` and `my.feature2` are enabled depending on the setting of `my.version`. When selecting the `S1` stream, then no feature should be active.

But as shown on the confirmation page, the `my.feature1` was enabled. That's because it is used in the filter of the CompoundTask `Feature1`. The `my.feature2` behaves correctly.

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/assets/208716/b6df0c5e-1334-4386-9736-da87d7273c53)

That code cannot simply be removed.  It was added when support for conditional tasks was added:

https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/commit/1db9130d4f07899319df833c8f80346c746c862b

The support for conditional tasks is super tricky because nothing is actually executed in a flow control style.  Rather tasks are gathered, where the conditions affect was gathered and what is not gathered.  

You can imagine having a filter expression on some compound C1 that sets some variable to a particular value and that variable is then being used in a filter on some compound C2 that conditionally sets the value of a variable that alters outcome of the filter on C1.  E.g., here is a non-nonsensical usage where Feature1, when my.feature1=true, will set my.version=1 which implies that my.feature.1 should be set to false by V1, which then implies Feature1's condition is false:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/assets/208716/d602a88f-7d20-4a73-a8d0-c58f1f33bac5)

You can see how this just becomes circular when there is no order of execution.

So using the value of a variable that is conditionally set elsewhere as a filter variable is just not workable because there isn't really any flow control. 

Probably you have a bigger example where this is just a small demonstrator, but somehow you must find a different or better way.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf3854utxc/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

What can you tell me about your network configuration?  I.e., is there a firewall that might be restricting access?

Note that you can download a zip file from here if your network allows that:

- https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/
- https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/2024-03/R/eclipse-jee-2024-03-R-win32-x86_64.zip

Note also though that you will not be able to perform updates or install new software with such an installation because the IDE application uses the same network access infrastructure as is used by the installer application so if the latter doesn't work, the former won't either, but at least you'll have a functional installation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf3857xatY/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

At our company, we use different Oomph files. Sometimes, we use the local one in our git repo (in one of our multiple clones), sometimes one that is uploaded to some server, and sometimes a local one to workaround some issues. The current setup (see above) doesn't show you which of these is selected, forcing you to remove the current one and add the one you need to ensure you have the right one.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/85/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You can see the information about the location of a setup is really quite a long string in the normal/standard case where the catalog is loaded via the setups zip.  What specifically are you hoping to see and where are you hoping to see it?

I'd like to know where the source of `Eclipse IDE for Sigasi Developers` is. Sometimes it is `~/Downloads/SigasiEclipse.setup`, sometimes it'll be `~/sigasi-development/git/SigasiEclipse.setup`, and other times it might be `sigasi.com/SigasiEclipse.setup`. Showing this path on a hover would solve the issue. Personally, I was thinking of a second part in the same row, like JDT's outline: the `byte[]` for `value`

I show link information only if the object is directly contained by a resource, so only the two catalogs show the details.  The tool item's state is persistent.  It's disabled by default.  I show both the direct URI of the resource as sell as the resolved URI, if it is different.

The project page has the same control:

I've shortened the very long archive: URIs to show only the location of the archive.

https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/66

One thing you could try **and I would really appreciate feedback** is to run the installer like this from a command prompt:

```
eclipse-inst-jre-win64.exe -vmargs -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=WINDOWS-ROOT -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=NONE
```

If that helps fix the problem, I could ensure that newer installers include that option automatically.

See this discussion why I've been concerned that I cannot confirm if the above actually fixes a problem:

Such PKIX exceptions are generally caused because the certificate used in the network traffic is not rooted on a certificate in the JDK/JRE's cacerts and firewalls often inject certificates into the network traffic.  

The options I mentioned are intended to make the running Java application use Windows own cacerts.

So I wonder, are you able to access this page in a browser?

https://download.eclipse.org/justj/jres/21/updates/release/latest/

I guess so...

If your firewall is blocking in interfering with the traffic you might be forced to just download a zip file from here instead:

I just stumble upon https://www.eclipse.org/setups/sponsor/ saying: `The June 12th release of the Eclipse IDE 2024-06 - 4.32 requires Java 21`... In PR description it says:
> ... the need for Java 21 for `all` the Eclipse 2024-06 4.32 IDEs

I'm confused... I downloaded the [`Eclipse Platform Runtime` 4.32 RC2a](https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/S-4.32RC2a-202406010610/#PlatformRuntime) and it executed with a Java 17 VM without any warning, but it was required by [Eclipse IDE for Java developers 2024-06 RC1](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2024-06/rc1/eclipse-ide-java-developers).

I don't see any reference to it neither in the [New and Noteworthy for 4.32](https://eclipse.dev/eclipse/news/4.32/) nor in the [4.32 project plan](https://eclipse.dev/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_32.xml) (in fact here it says it was tested with 17 and 21 in the `Target Environments` table).

**Questions:**
1. Is this change only for the pre-built packages or will it be a requirement also for users that build other apps based on the Eclipse Platform?
2. Do you have more information to share where it was discussed? I remember that for the bump to Java 17 it was discussed in the platform dev list.
3. From [equinox-launcher](https://github.com/eclipse-equinox/equinox/blob/343e816ec9820a090c0c1bec56e5131513270bd3/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher/src/org/eclipse/equinox/launcher/Main.java#L592) I see that the check is based on the `osgi.requiredJavaVersion` system property... if I change it to 17 in `eclipse.ini` file the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 4.32 RC1 opens just fine.... is it a ""soft"" requirement to prepare to actually require it later for the Platform?

Thanks in advance

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

Those have this as the splash screen:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/master/packages/org.eclipse.epp.package.common/splash.bmp

The Eclipse SDK has this as the splash screen (already updated to 2024-09 because they started new development for the next release already):

https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform/blob/master/platform/org.eclipse.platform/splash.png

While the Eclipse SDK does indeed work fine with Java 17, some of the things that you might want to install into it will require Java 21.  In any case, it also runs well and is tested to run well with Java 21.  I'm not sure when specifically the Platform will use Java 21 features and have hard requirements to run on Java 21. Perhaps for the 4.33 release...

The packaged IDEs (zips/tars) come with Java 21 so I'm not exactly sure what you installed/tried.  If I unzip it, remove the -vm  option and the -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=21 option, and run it with Java 17, then it does launch, but like this:

I understand the context and importance of the warning, and it's true that people often overlook important information if they assume it doesn't apply to them.

While the headline ""_If you don't read this, **bad things** will happen_"" certainly grabs attention, it might be too alarmist and could cause unnecessary anxiety among users. It is not trust building. (At least that was the impression in our team when some of us got this message...)

Ideally, this message should only appear (within the IDE...) when someone encounters an issue using an unsupported Java version. If the warning is relevant and timely, it is more likely to be read and understood. Is something like this possible?

In the meantime: A headline should be urgent but also informative and reassuring. Something more balanced like ""_Important Update: Please Read to Avoid Issues_"" would convey urgency while maintaining a professional tone. We could also dive into more details and write something like ""_Important information for users who rely on a JDK older than Java 21_"" or ""_Important update: Read carefully if you rely on a JDK older than Java 21_"".

What do you think?

Have you ever had to add keys to your Java's installation's cacerts?   Maybe the cacerts of the JRE installed on your system have been updated.  

You can get installers **without** an embedded JRE here and these will use the default JRE of your system.

You can also download a package:

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

But you will not be able to update or installer new software on these for exactly the same reason.

The certificate chain can viewed in a browser and can be export to *.pem so that one can use keytool.exe -import -alias some-alias cacerts -file xyz.pem to add it to each JDK's cacerts.  I had to do this last month for a client.    I hope I remember how to do it the next time.  Google this:
```
java add certificate to cacert

I installed the selected item - Eclipse Platform. The image you posted is also what I see if I go to the catalog.

Yes, I do need to understand this.

My goal is rather simple: create a minimal Eclipse on which I can install what I need.
Usually we are told that https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ contains the basic Eclipse package, without the prepared packages (""for Java developers"", ""for C/C++ developers"", ""for Web developers""...), but I found this to not really be the case just by going on adventures with the components. This link downloads the Eclipse SDK, which is also geared towards plugin developers and developers of the platform itself. If I look at its installation details, I see:

* ECF ... Developer Resources items
* Plugin Development Environment items
* EMF ... Developer Resources items
* Other development resources

I'd venture a guess that most Eclipse users don't need these because they don't write plugins or develop the platform. I could be wrong about this analysis. However, after installing the minimal Eclipse Platform + JDT I get what looks to me like a completely functional environment that is *less than twice the size and loads more than twice faster* than the one in the link above. Of course, then a run-of-the-mill developer might need to add some Mavan/Gradle plugins, Git integration and other common plugins like that.

> You can even go so far as to literally define a *.product file and use Tycho to build it (just like Oomph does for the Installer Product.)

This is what I was looking at, and I might do. It will basically be the Platform + JDT, which is a skinnier version of the SDK from the link.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf386Pm1Vd/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

There is no drop target working, while on windows we can drag and drop in the top title. 

The workaround (to install) is to use the 'copy Link' and then to click, in advanced mode, in the 'Apply configuration from the clipboard' button (only visible if the clipboard contains a link). It works, but this is not really straightforward.

May be the complex OomphDropAdapter using editing domain is too much for just the label at the top of the window...  The OomphDropAdapter is probably interesting for other cases in the tree to update the oomph model but if the Label Drop target at the top is simple expecting an URL Drop, we could may be simplify it .. 

@merks do you think I can setup a new drop adapter only in this area, and keep the OomphDropAdapter for the other cases (I assume there are other cases)...

1. An single ""complex"" implementation used uniformly throughout the framework that works on all platforms.
2. An additional  new ""simpler"" implementation used only for the simple installer and is created simply because the existing implementation doesn't work macos for reasons unknown.

I'd much rather see the reasons unknown become known so that Oomph's support on macos is generally improved via option 1.

Yes, drag-and-drop is used elsewhere, e.g, on advanced installer titles and in their tree views, and of course generally in the Oomph editors.  The main complexity with drag and drop is that while Windows provides early information about what is being dragged from where to where, the other platforms generally have those details only at the end when the drop happens.

I expect the code to get here when the drop happens:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03982edf-dbc2-4b72-ad81-2f69aecd0e2e)

Probably for macos the dragAndDropCommandInformation is null, which I simulated on Windows by setting it to null in the debugger.  It ends up creating a load resource command and when that executes, that's what's used to by to drive the dialogs:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb5c552b-29dc-453a-8fd0-079bc6536715)

Dragging the Drag Link... doesn't work, and here we see the native transfer is yielding a URL with a line break character in it:

```
I can ""repair"" such a thing in Oomph, but it seems to me that the native transfer is wrong or unhelpful, but at least there is data that could be processed.

Dragging the image does not produce a URL transfer at all:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cff278ca-3a12-46d0-b245-d91b940547a1)

Dragging and dropping it onto a text editor opens a new editor with stuff in it that looks like the contents of the page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe992ea8-48cc-42c7-977a-6f46c13ee6e7)

When I look at all the native transfers being called in OomphTransferDelegate I don't see any of those return something useful for this case.   So it just doesn't appear that dragging that thing is like dragging a link as far as SWT is concerned.

Probably macos has similar problems. 

The places to look are in org.eclipse.oomph.internal.ui.OomphTransferDelegate where nativeToJava is being called to get the dragged contents out of the native layer.

If you can instrument this code and provide details about what the framework seems coming out of the transfer layer, that would be very helpful to try to get at least some of these working...

This means that one needs to install a JDK manually before the application of the configuration can be completed. This is unfortunate since Oomph actually will install a JDK, usually of a matching or even higher version.
On workaround might be to install just the product and to apply the configuration then later.

But ideally by default the installer would just use the JDK to be installed by Oomph. This could maybe be done by setting the future path of the to be installed JDK and ignoring that it doesn't exist yet.
Of course if a user wants to this variable should still be overidable.

If you know a better strategy to solve this or have some pointers where to start, I can look into solving this.

There is no general knowledge about a future location of a JRE/JDK.  Which JDK is used to run the installation is generally unrelated to the JRE configured in the IDE and it can and is selected in different ways.  If one chooses a JDK on the machine, then the dialog/selection will not be empty.  If one chooses a JustJ JRE, we don't know the exact version and hence the location until looking in the p2 repository. Of course one could also just not have a JRE task at all and end up with an IDE where there is only a JRE corresponding to the one running the installation.  Having a JRE that's specifically a Java 17 JRE because that's what's currently targeted seems like  a good thing, even if the IDE itself is running with Java 21.  I expect that folks who will be contributing to enhancing the Eclipse IDE's complex frameworks will have an easy time installing Java...","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf386Qn-ft/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If my setups contain a `MyLynQueriesTask` and I am using an Eclipse version being configured for MyLyn 4.0.0+ P2 feature names, then the installer runs into unresovable P2 feature dependency conflicts.
In this case I did use **Eclipse 2024-03** for the setup.

**Root cause assumed**
The current [MyLyn.ecore](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/blob/45a33a82ae2235a2486c19872fcb7e4fef632b73/setups/models/Mylyn.ecore#L22)  is defining feature `org.eclipse.mylyn.bugzilla_feature.feature.group`  for the `MyLynQueriesTask`. This feature name is not provided by MyLyn >=4.0.0 anymore as far as I can see. MyLyn did change the feature names with MyLyn 4.0.0 versus MyLyn 3.x.

**Workaround**
When I change the MyLyn features of the Eclipse product setup definitions using MyLyn 4+ feature names to optional, then the installation did work.

**Solution Proposal**
Remove or make the feature dependency `org.eclipse.mylyn.bugzilla_feature.feature.group` optional for `MyLynQueriesTask` installableUnits to be agnostic regarding the MyLyn version coming with Eclipse platform or being used by custom setups.

@merks
As far as I see the MyLyn features did ""continuously"" migrate from MyLyn 3.x to 4.x features within the following Eclipse product setups (checked for IDE for Java Developers only):
**2023-06**: MyLyn **3.x** features only
**2023-09**: MyLyn **4.x** features non optional, MyLyn **3.x** features **optional**
**2023-12**: MyLyn **4.x** features only, all MyLyn **3.x** named features **removed** - **except** `org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext_feature.feature.group`
**2024-03**: MyLyn **4.x** features only, `org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.feature.feature.group` **added**, `org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext_feature.feature.group` set to **optional**
**2024-06**: MyLyn **4.x** features only, `org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext_feature.feature.group` **removed**

Probably the create fails because the repository exists, but even for that we throw away the exception too, none of which is helpful for determining anything about the reason for failure.

This definitely should be improved.

Another useful option for the installer is `-Doomph.setup.remote.debug=maybe`.  Then in the eclipse.ini of the installation it will contain this:
```
-DDoomph.setup.remote.debug=true
-DXdebug
-DXrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8123
```
Then I can easily change it to this later:
```
-Doomph.setup.remote.debug=true
-Xdebug
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8123
```
Of course you can copy and paste that form this issue as well now.  Because of `-Doomph.setup.remote.debug=true` the IDE/installation will stop with a prompt before it starts doing lots of setup stuff.  I'm not sure for this case if that it's early enough.  If not, you can specify `suspend=y` to make the JVM stop right on startup. But probably you won't need that and be careful with this because it will appear as if nothing happen and that Eclipse didn't start, and it won't start until you attach a debug agent...

In the Oomph IDE we have this launcher:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9d9dea3-35ad-4afb-a9e6-91fcf2652967)

So then one can attach a debug to the installation and debug what's going on via normal breaks.

1. `fileArtifactRepository` is `null` on L124

3. `createRepository()` throws an exception containing a `detailMessage` of `Repository already exists at file:/Users/marklawrence/.p2/pool/.`

In our oomph profile I'm doing some hacking around to the files that contain the update sites, so that they're disabled when people run 'check for updates'. (I only really want people using oomph to get updates via oomph)
As part of that, there were a few lines in those files specific to the individual users pool directory. In our oomph, through one way or another, I've had those lines removed on a fresh install.

The line `artifactRepositoryManager.contains(uri)` is going to check the pool directory is a known repository (and more than likely uses these files I've hacked to consult its one it knows about), it doesn't find it because of what I've done in our Oomph, therefore tries to create it.
It likely adds it back into the repository/update sites list before trying to create the location, at which point it goes bang.

I'll stop what I'm doing with the update site/repository list files, and see if that resolves it, then I'll close the ticket.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf386a5e-b/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, this is a duplicate of that. 

This does makes me nervous though, because it kind of means we're reaching the ceiling of our Eclipse Installer use, and we'd likely have to stick at the version of Eclipse we're on now, and on oomph 1.35.0 for the foreseeable. As well as, Eclipse Installer from the main Eclipse site won't work for back level Linux versions anymore.

Forking and doing our own build pipeline makes sense, as I can bake the customisations into that, rather than doing things half manually/half scripted later. I'm guessing it could be as simple as running [this in Jenkins](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/blob/master/releng/org.eclipse.oomph.parent/Jenkinsfile) with some modifications, and the repackage.sh?

In terms of the changes, I only really spotted [this](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/commit/9d336879e62869403c8e9394bbb7bb6ef09dd3a2) as potentially causing the issue, so I could reverse the change?

In the meantime, I'll stick to using 1.35.0, and live with any issues in there.

Between these builds, I've noticed `org.eclipse.oomph.p2.core` has changed, not sure if the changes in there might give any clues?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/129/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That worked fine without a prompt, and updated to the new version:

I can't test on the mac. 

Could you please try to run it like this:
```
eclipse-inst -vmargs -Duser.home=<test-user-home>
```
I.e., specify a writable folder location as the `user.home` that you can subsequently delete after testing.  I'm just trying to eliminate the possibility that something in your real user home is having an impact, e.g., if p2 knows of any file-based artifact repositories it will tend to prefer to get the artifact from that repository instead of from the internet.  (Somehow I ended up getting an unsigned version of m2e into by shared bundle pool and now I always get complaints about that.  😢)

It looks like the artifact is coming from eclipse platform.

It opens a URL as specified in the Oomph catalog index so we can dynamically control and URL and the content:

There have been discussions about providing a similar type of notification via an in-application view.  

I've prototyped something rough.  Here we see the regular sponsorship link opened in an editor in the light-theme IDE along with the new view at the bottom showing how the content can be dynamically adjusted to suit the theme:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccae2e78-bd3d-4f34-9abd-1baded0060f3)

E.g., here is how it looks in dark theme:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b8d0bf0-df84-4445-8470-2c3dff2b76ec)

Note how the foreground and background colors match the theme.  This is accomplished by passing query parameters that can be used by the javascript of the page to adjust the appearance of the content which we can see here in an actual external browser.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cba7a645-247b-4669-b2c8-32ccb65fdddf)

You can contrast this with the editor showing the standard sponsorship page which is really not well-designed to be shown within a themed IDE application.

It's not 100% clear what additional value this will bring nor how best to exploit this perhaps both for potential notification, e.g., of some security problem, and for prompting interest in sponsorship.  How often should we show it?  Every startup?  Once a week on startup?  How will this be better than the current/old approach?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/134/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This was probably already discussed but I'll nevertheless ask the obvious question: wouldn't it suffice to let the ""official"" sponsor page adapt to the current theme?

The internal browser works with that too (at least for Windows)

Sponsoring is down by 50% over the last year and a bit.  This has an impact on the IDE WG budget.  What can we do the improve this?  We are told that the webdev folks are working on design improvements.  Of course there other questions too such as why is it down? Also it would be nice to gather statistics so that when we try something different we can see what difference it makes...

In any case,  Wayne did a quick prototype of a view some time back and there was some discussion about that here:

https://github.com/waynebeaton/org.eclipse.sponsor/issues/1

As stated in that issue:

> The requirement as I understand it, is to drive more people to sponsorship. I am fully aware of the menu item in the IDE and button in the installer; they've been there for a while, so the idea is to try and do something else.

That work was presented to the IDE WG and discussed with the Planning Council.  So I'm trying to get something done to keep the issue moving forward because this has been stalled for a very long time.  I'm not personally confident that showing information in a view will make a significant difference, but it is ""something else"".  That being said, I do not like to waste my efforts on pointless activities...

As I see it, there are multiple angles to this:

1. How/where is the information presented?
2. How often is the information presented?
3. What information is presented?

The following is the status quo:

1. The information is presented via a URL in the default browser of the IDE, which is by default is an external browser. 
2. The URL is updated 4 times a year after the release and therefore is presented to user 4 times a year.
3. Previously https://www.eclipse.org/setups/installer/notification/ was presented but now https://www.eclipse.org/sponsor/ide/ is  presented.

Some technical considerations.  

1. The support for opening a URL allows the code to force the URL to open in an external browser but one cannot force it to open in an editor or a view if the preference is set to use an external browser.
2. We can easily update the URL once a week if we wish to present the information more often or we can easily build a timeout to present it after some elapsed time since the last time it was presented.
3. In browser the page will look fine as it is intended/designed to be displayed in a browser.  In the IDE, the view area is quite small and the content is not generally designed for that restricted size.  The editor area is bigger, but the content is still quite big and is not generally adjusting to the theme of the IDE, though of course in principle it could do that. The editor or view could be maximized.

---

Finally to your question:

> wouldn't it suffice to let the ""official"" sponsor page adapt to the current theme?

Take a small step back and ask yourself whether sponsorship is down because one or more of the following reasons?

- The page doesn't adjust to the theme.
- The page is shown in a browser instead of in the IDE as an editor or view.
- The page isn't shown often enough.
- The page's content does not make sponsorship compelling.

We don't have answers to any of those and basically are stalled on ""try to do something else"".

You'll note that there is little in the way of comments here which one can interpret in different ways:

- I don't care.
- I don't have an opinion.
- I'm not interested.
- What you plan is so awesomely perfectly I'm speechless.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/comments/IC_kwDOJvvf386dU74_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I see that I've missed several nuances with my very naive proposal (thank God I'm not designing UI/UX 😅 ).

You're right: even if the webpage adapts its color to the current theme, the internal browser is smaller and the content in the page is designed/aligned to bigger windows so the result in the IDE would be subpar. One small detail though: the initial situation changed regarding the `IE` browser --> we now have `Edge` by default. But it's just a drop in a bucket, not really a difference.

I'm not 100% sure it's possible with Edge but it seems to I could get close to the final steps of donation when testing it earlier in the week.
