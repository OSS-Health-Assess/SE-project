```
•  accordeon menu doesn't fit well for cases with many entries in many groups
•  how to represent sub-groups?
•  rather static way of defining the contents, based on predefined ""create features"". How to provide for dynamic customizations/extensions, provided by extra actor bundles etc?
```

A tree-based palette seems better suited for our needs, possible combined with a ""favorites"" container and a search field. (cfr passerelle).

So we need the following :

```
•  disable std Graphiti/GEF palette
•  maybe use that screen space to show a favorites panel
•  implement a tree-based palette view
•  use an extensions-based approach to define the palette contents. It can be based on a combination of concepts from eclipse menu extensions and the implementation in passerelle.
```

In a second phase we could allow the user to reconfigure the palette contents in a preferences page and/or using a context menu in the palette.

But we need some improvements in integrating both feature-sets. 

PtII ModelExecutionAssertion is not applicable now on a model being executed by Triquetrum's WorkflowExecutionService. This is because a model enriched to collect execution statistics and then passed to Triquetrum's service, is internally cloned first. The cloning loses some of the statistics collection stuff (_actorFiringListeners in particular).

To resolve this without breaking Triquetrum service APIs, we could manage the setup of execution statistics inside the execution service, e.g. always when running in DEBUG mode.

The invoking code (e.g. unit tests) can then apply assertions on the model as can be found in the ProcessHandle. E.g. similar to:

    ProcessHandle procHandle = processingService.start(StartMode.DEBUG, model, null, null, null);
    processingService.waitUntilFinished(procHandle, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    
    new ModelExecutionAssertion()
    .expectActorIterationCount(..., 1L)
    .expectMsgReceiptCount(..., 1L)
    .expectMsgSentCount(..., 1L)
    .assertModel(procHandle.getModel());

To create a Maven pom.xml file, the Eclipse Tycho Tutorial at http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html#maventycho_generatepom1 suggests that we do: 

> mvn org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-pomgenerator-plugin:generate-poms -DgroupId=triquetrum

To avoid creating pom.xml files in each directory, https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Release_Notes/0.24#POM-less_Tycho_builds suggests creating a .mvn/extensions.xml file, which I did:

> bash-3.2$ mkdir .mvn
> bash-3.2$ cp ../../triquetrum/.mvn/extensions.xml .mvn

Ok, so the next step is to run Maven.

The Eclipse Tycho Tutorial states:

> ""Tip: It is not recommended to use the mvn clean install command, instead you should use mvn clean verify. If you would use the install option, the build result would be installed in your local Maven repository and this can lead to build problems.""

The tutorial also states:

> ""Warning If you try to execute this POM file, the build fail because you have not yet configured your dependencies."" 

Indeed, just running ""mvn clean"" fails because ""package ptolemy.data 10.1.0"" is not found:

So, now the question is: how to get Tycho to know where these dependencies are.

In a perfect world, we could use the Maven dependency facility in the pom.xml file, but this is not how Eclipse and Tycho work for various good reasons.

It looks to me like I would need to put these up on an Eclipse p2 server.  I'm assuming that I could host one of these?  Is this correct?  There was also some ideas of using jetty to bring up a local p2 server for our jar files.

The p2-maven-plugin at http://projects.reficio.org/p2-maven-plugin/1.1.0/manual.html looks useful.

This stackoverflow post looks helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13268213/how-to-use-directory-containing-third-party-bundles-in-a-tycho-build

As does this, but it is not a perfect fit: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Dependency_Resolution_Troubleshooting

Jay suggested:

Erwin wrote:

> Great that you're taking up this task. I think that to get things working quickly, Jay's approach is the easiest for now, i.e. we put all dependencies as jars inside a wrapper bundle that then exports all Java packages from there. It would be a straightforward redefinition of what is now org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform.

I'll create a branch with my pom.xml and .mvn/extension.xml file.

CapeCode uses Ptolemy II, which has the notion of configurations that presents to the user different sets of actors and other features.

It would be helpful if we could have a CapeCode configuration in Triquetrum.  This would probably be a separate product that included a separate palette.

In Ptolemy II, the CapeCode configuration may be found in `ptII/ptolemy/configs/capecode/`.

CapeCode uses Nashorn, so Java 1.8 would be required. 

Currently, to make this work, we would need to create a set of jar files that contain the Ptolemy classes.

The UI would need to be extended so that we have things like:
- Hierarchical models
- Hierarchical actor palettes
- Support for dragging in attributes
  - Textual Annotations in the model

It is not clear to me how we would create an Actor bundle that will support this.

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Extending_Triquetrum#Creating_an_actor_bundle describes how to create an actor bundle where each actor is implemented by a Java class.

However, in Cape Code, we have multiple actors that each implement org.terraswarm.accessor.jjs.JSAccessor.

BTW - When `$PTII/bin/vergil -capecode` is run, there is an Accessors node in the actor tree view.  When that node is opened, org/terraswarm/accessor/AccessorLibrary.java gets https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/index.json which contains:

```
[
    ""audio"",
    ""cameras"",
    ""devices"",
    ""gdp"",
    ""image"",
    ""net"",
    ""robotics"",
    ""geodesy"",
    ""services"",
    ""signals"",
    ""test"",
    ""utilities""
]
```

Each of the elements represents a directory, so https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/audio/index.json is opened, which contains:

```

[
    ""AudioCapture.js"",
    ""AudioPlayer.js"",
    ""ClipPlayer.js""
]
```

https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/audio/AudioCapture.js is opened and passed to the accessorToMoML() method in org/terraswarm/accessor/JSAccessor.java, which returns MoML that looks like

```
<entity name=""AudioCapture"" class=""org.terraswarm.accessor.jjs.JSAccessor"">
  <property name=""accessorSource"" value=""https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/audio/AudioCapture.js""/>
  <input source=""file:/Users/cxh/ptII/org/terraswarm/accessor/accessors/web/audio/AudioCapturePtDoc.xml""/>
  <property name=""script"" value=""...""
  <property name=""_tableauFactory"" class=""ptolemy.vergil.toolbox.TextEditorTableauFactory"">

    <property name=""syntaxStyle"" value=""text/javascript""/>
  </property>
  <property name=""script"">

      <property name=""note"" value=""NOTE: To see the script, invoke Open Actor""/>
    </property>
  </property>
</entity>
```

So, what we need to do is modify the bundle activator to do the above access of the index.json files and instantiation.

I think what you need is to be able to add multiple entries in the palette definition, based on a same underlying actor Java class, each with some different parameters/properties. And this is already possible in theory in Triquetrum. I.e. we can set properties on actors in the palette. But this has not yet been used/proven and may not be sufficient. 

I looked around in ptII/ptolemy/configs/capecode/ but it seems the real accessor configuration info should come from : 

```
<!-- Standard TerraSwarm accessors. -->
<entity name=""Accessors"" class=""org.terraswarm.accessor.AccessorLibrary"">
  <configure source=""https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors""/>
</entity>
```

and I could not see the XML there that could show how an accessor actor is defined in a capecode configuration. 

Or is this done based on what you describe above, i.e. there's some js/json files that get transformed by the JSAccessor actor code itself?

If the last part of your comment means that the palette is not known/defined upfront in a Vergil configuration, but is generated on the fly each time, reading the json/js file on the terraswarm URL, I can see several issues : 
- What happens when you're working off-line? Can you only design capecode models when being on-line?
- Triquetrum does not support dynamically changing palettes yet. This should be technically feasible, but won't be available before Tuesday, the deadline for the newsletter...
- What is the ""input"" element for in the MOML fragment above? Is that only needed to include a help document for the actor? (which we don't support yet anyway in Triquetrum)

Below are some answers to your questions:

In Vergil, the palette is created when the Accessors tab in the actor palette is opened.  Vergil has lazy evaluation of the elements in the actor palette.  This means that startup is fast and if there are problems with a set of actors, they don't cause problems until you try to use them.  If you search the actors for an actor by name, then each set of actors is opened as the search proceeds.

If you are working offline, then Cape Code looks in $PTII/org/terraswarm/accessor/accessors/web for the accessors.  In fact, it looks there first and then looks at the website.

How the AccessorLibrary class works is that it looks for a index.json file that names directories that contain index.json files.  These second-level index.json files name .js files that define the accessors.  The accessor .js files are read in and then converted to MoML, which is then parsed and added to the configuration.  I think we will want the bundle activator to do this parsing for us.

The input element causes the MoMLParser to read input from a file as if the contents of that file were present in the MoML.

Not getting this done by Tuesday is not a problem.  I'm on holiday today.

In other news, I added org.terraswarm.accessor to osgi-2-0/.  When I run `mvn clean verify`, the build fails for the following reasons.
1. The version of ptolemy.data.expr.Constants in osgi-2-0 is missing the nameToType(type) method.  We need to figure out a policy about how to update existing files in the Ptolemy II bundles that have passed IP CQ.  I propose that we bump the version numbers,make changes and then submit the changes to IPCQ.   We need to refine and document how this is done.
2. io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle is not found.  This code uses Vert.x, I need to figure out how to require it in pom.xml
3. ptolemy.data.ImageToken and ptolemy.util.StringBufferExec are not present.  We should consider adding these files to the bundles.

My idea is to get the above to compile and then work on the activator.  I'm not going to get much done today.

The palette provider adds the BaseA.js test accessor to the Triquetrum palette.

Main purpose is to try to understand what it takes, the code or workspace setup is not OK at all for real usage.

Besides updating some ptII classes (as mentioned previously by Christopher as well), I see following issues that must be addressed, both in ptII Java code and in JavaScript files (at least these are things I am aware of at this moment, we may discover more...) :

Things that are not compatible with OSGi-based modularity : 
- usage of $CLASSPATH in file/resource/module lookup code
- loading JavaScript and JSON files with locations relative to specific Java classes in the ptII package
- maintaining accessor/node modules in a single aggregated tree

I copied the files on some fixed local paths and changed the lookup code in some places to point there i.o. using $CLASSPATH-relative paths etc.

Triquetrum-specific issues for CapeCode : 
- I have the impression that the BaseA accessor does not automatically get its extra inputs from the JavaScript :
`
exports.setup = function () {
    this.input('in1');
    console.log('base set up');
}
`
Should the BaseA accessor get an 'in1' input port? For the moment it only has a 'script' input port and an 'error' output port. Is there some actor lifecycle method to invoke before rendering it in the editor?

This looks promising.

About $CLASSPATH, I spent some time last week getting Cape Code to work when run from just jar files (I think).  The code unjars files and directories to a temporary location and then reads files from that location.  The temporary files are deleted upon exit.  This is a half step, a better solution would be to read the jar files and provide the content of the files without creating a temporary file.  We do this for the Duktape-based accessor hosts.  (Duktape is a JavaScript interpreter written in C.  org/terraswarm/accessor/accessors/adm/hosts/duktape/eduk is a Duktape host that is meant for an embedded platform that has no file system, instead the contents of the .js files are encoded in arrays.)

I can see why $CLASSPATH would be a problem with OSGi.  It would be really helpful to be able to support $CLASSPATH.  If we can't support it, we need something similar.  As a workaround, for CapeCode we could just provide either a directory tree that has .js files or a jar file that has the .js files that gets unjared. 

About your BaseA accessor, the input port ""in1"" should be created.

The way this works is that  ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs/JavaScript.java has _createEngineAndEvaluateSetup(), which contains:

```
        // Create proxies for the port.   
        // Note that additional proxies may need to be created in initialize(),      
	// if they are created by a setup() function call.   
        _proxies = new HashMap<NamedObj, PortOrParameterProxy>();
        _proxiesByName = new HashMap<String, PortOrParameterProxy>();
        for (TypedIOPort port : portList()) {
            // Do not convert the script or error ports to a JavaScript variable.  
            if (port == script.getPort() || port == error) {
                continue;
            }
            PortOrParameterProxy proxy = new PortOrParameterProxy(port);
            _proxies.put(port, proxy);
            _proxiesByName.put(port.getName(), proxy);
        }
```
I think the comment about initialize might not be accurate.

I created a model with a BaseA JavaScript actor that has your JavaScript code in it.  The model is here:

[BaseA.xml.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/files/627565/BaseA.xml.zip)

Looking at the xml, the port is present:

```
    <entity name=""JavaScript"" class=""ptolemy.actor.lib.jjs.JavaScript"">
        <property name=""script"" class=""ptolemy.actor.parameters.PortParameter"" value=""exports.setup = function () { this.input('in1'); console.log('base se\
t up'); }"">
            <property name=""style"" class=""ptolemy.actor.gui.style.NoteStyle"">
                <property name=""note"" class=""ptolemy.kernel.util.StringAttribute"" value=""NOTE: To see the script, invoke Open Actor"">
                </property>
            </property>
        </property>
        <property name=""_tableauFactory"" class=""ptolemy.vergil.toolbox.TextEditorTableauFactory"">
            <property name=""attributeName"" class=""ptolemy.kernel.util.StringAttribute"" value=""script"">
            </property>
            <property name=""syntaxStyle"" class=""ptolemy.kernel.util.StringAttribute"" value=""text/javascript"">
            </property>
        </property>
        <property name=""_location"" class=""ptolemy.kernel.util.Location"" value=""{295, 165}"">
        </property>
        <port name=""in1"" class=""ptolemy.actor.TypedIOPort"">
            <property name=""input""/>
            <property name=""defaultValue"" class=""ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter"">
            </property>
        </port>
    </entity>
```

When I open the model, stdout shows that setup() is invoked:

```
bash-3.2$ $PTII/bin/vergil -capecode ~/tmp/BaseA.xml   
JavaScript: base set up (Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0,6,main])     
JavaScript: base set up (Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0,6,main]) 
```

I'm not sure why it is invoked twice, that seems buggy.

I'll take a look at your code and see what changes you had to make.  I'm working a short day today and not working much over the weekend, so it might be Monday before I get to this.

Something I had forgotten to mention before : I also had to remove the 
moml parts about NoteStyle and TextEditorTableauFactory, as they're 
linked to Vergil-specific classes that are not in the Ptolemy II OSGi 
bundles. A more ambitious approach would be to try to implement these 
concepts on Eclipse RCP technology, but that's too complex for me...

In Vergil, NoteStyle just modifies the parameter configuration window with a note that says ""To see the script, invoke Open Actor"".  In Vergil, TextEditorTableauFactory brings up an editor for the .js.

I took a look at your code and it looks like you are loading in capeCodeHost.xml and localFunctions.xml with an absolute path that is Windows-dependent which is fine in the near term.

One possible change that is missing is that ./ptolemy.gui/original-src/ptolemy/actor/gui/JNLPUtilities.java should probably be updated to get my change that will copy a directory from a jar file to a temporary location.  I'm not sure if this will change things, but it might.

BTW - I'm still working on actor/lib/jjs/NashornAccessoHostApplication.java

That file loads a composite accessor and, if it worked, might be a good quick test.  

However, it is non-deterministic, so I suggest avoiding it.

Triquetrum uses Vert.x, so I would like osgi-2.0/org.terraswarm.accessor to some how require vert.x

I was thinking that osgi-2-0/pom.xml would contain:

```
    <module>org.terraswarm.accessor</module> 
```

and osgi-2-0/org.terraswarm.accessor/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF would contain:

```
Require-Bundle: ptolemy.moml;bundle-version=""11.0.0"",
 vertx-core;bundle-version=""3.3.3""
```
because https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.vertx/vertx-core/3.3.3 includes the following code for maven:

```
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.vertx/vertx-core -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
    <artifactId>vertx-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.3</version>
</dependency>
```

However, that does not work, probably because Tycho is not looking for the Maven repository or because the Maven file is not correct.

I do have  ~/.m2/repository/io/vertx/vertx-core/3.3.3/vertx-core-3.3.3.jar

and the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF of vertx-core-3.3.3.jar contains:

```
Bundle-SymbolicName: io.vertx.core
...
Bundle-Name: Vert.x Core
Bundle-Version: 3.3.3
Maven-Version: 3.3.3
Created-By: Apache Maven Bundle Plugin
Build-Jdk: 1.8.0_92
Maven-Group-Id: io.vertx
```

I tried modifying osgi-2-0/org.terraswarm.accessor/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF to

```
Require-Bundle: ptolemy.moml;bundle-version=""11.0.0"",
 Vert.x Core;bundle-version=""3.3.3""
```
and

```
Require-Bundle: ptolemy.moml;bundle-version=""11.0.0"",
 io.vertx.core;bundle-version=""3.3.3""
```
but neither one worked, for the latter case, `mvn clean verify` resulted in:

Really what I need is a p2 repository that has the appropriate file.

https://github.com/glyn/vert.x.osgi has a bundling/ directory that will create vertx jar files that look OK to me.  

https://github.com/eclipse/vert.x/issues/708 is interesting.


There is https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/rt.vertx/releases/3.4.0

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vertx is of interest

https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2016/october/article4.php uses maven, instead of an Eclipse p2 site.

However, shouldn't the Vert.x OSGi files be available somewhere in a p2 site?  Presumably they have passed CQ and there are signed jars somewhere?

If not, then I guess I need to add https://github.com/glyn/vert.x.osgi to the osgi-2-0 repo so that we can create the bundles, sign them and put them on the ptolemy p2 site.

I used that to get `mvn verify` working.

I also created two plugin projects by using File -> New -> Project -> Plug-in Development -> Plug-in from existing JAR archive.  I created one for org.json, the other for io.vertx.core.

One downside is that these two projects are missing something, so I can't yet deploy them on the osgi-2-0 p2 server.

I was able to run a trivial example.  A word of explanation is in order.  The accessor system has what we call accessor hosts.  Cape Code is an accessor host that allows combinations of Ptolemy actors and accessors.  There is also a Nashorn host that is implemented in Java, but does not use Ptolemy actors, it only uses accessors.

ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs/NashornAccessorHostApplication.java defines a main() method that invokes the Nashorn Accessor host.

A simple test is:

```
bash-3.2$ (cd $PTII/org/terraswarm/accessor/accessors/web; $PTII/bin/ptinvoke ptolemy.actor.lib.jjs.Na\
shornAccessorHostApplication -timeout 10000 -js hosts/nashorn/test/testNashornHost.js)  
commonHost.js: processCommandLineArguments(): Setting timeout to stop after 10000 ms.
Instantiated accessor TestComposite with class test/TestComposite
TestAdder: fire(): inputLeft: 10 inputRight: 40
50
No standalone accessors were instantiated
commonHost.js: processCommandLineArguments(): Maximum time reached. Calling stopAllAccessors().
ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs/modules/process/process.js: called exit()
bash-3.2$ 
```

To replicate this in a project that has the osgi-2-0 bundles:

```
svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/projects/eal/ptII/branches/osgi-2-0
```
Then start up Eclipse, create a new empty workspace and import the projects from the directory created above.

Create a Java Application:

* Main tab:

When the application is run, you should see something like:
```
Instantiated accessor TestComposite with class test/TestComposite
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
TestAdder: fire(): inputLeft: 10 inputRight: 40
50
```
Clearly, we need to fix the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

We also need to resolve things like how we find files and $CLASSPATH.

CapeCode uses org.json.  We have a copy of it in the ptII repo.  I wanted to provide org.json to Triquetrum, so I built an org.json bundle.

The incubation list at http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/incubation/msg00341.html has details about org.json.  Apparently there is a bundle in Orbit somewhere.  However, they have not been able to get the org.json author to agree to licensing terms on a more recent version.  There was a suggestion of using JSON-P.  

In the near term, we can do nothing. 

In the short term, we should see about using the org.json bundle in Orbit.

In the longer term, ptII should probably be migrated off of org.json.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjQ4OTE1Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That project includes jar files created from the osgi-2-0 branch of the ptII repo.

See http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal for how to get access to the ptII repo.

It would be good to set up OSGi bundles for the Ptolemy II source files.

To do this would presumable require sign-off about the IP in those files.

Also, the package names would change, which would break compatibility.  FWIW- the MoMLParser includes a filter system (ptolemy.moml.filter) that might allow us to read old models and translate the class names.  This is a serious downside and basically a fork of the ptII tree.

Advantages include:
- We can start maintaining these files in CI
- Easier updates of the Triquetrum

The open issue now is: What do we need to do to check the source code for these bundles in to the Eclipse repo.

The first step is to get these bundles to pass the Eclipse IP process.  Ideally, this would be done in time for the October release.

To get these files checked in would require getting the authors to agree.  There are about 40,000 checkins, with about 100 authors.  About 30 of those authors are external, though most have made very few contributions.

The next steps would be to make it so that we can easily deploy OSGi bundles for random jar files.
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html#convertjars discusses how to do this.
Once we can convert jar files to bundles, then we could easily create the Cape Code jar files from within ptII, then generate the bundles.  This would give us a way to deploy Cape Code.

We could test this by creating a Triquetrum workflow that provides some sort of simple data analysis routine and hook that into ICE.

I'm working up some sketches now of the best way to hook this up to ICE. However, the short term hack is to obtain the ICE Core service from the OSGi and then when a new workflow is created for Triquetrum it can just be registered with the Core via an adapter ItemBuilder and Item.

- Working on Adapters, need to find use cases where a Triq wf could come in handy.
- Technically, this is really easy. We need an example. If we create something in ICE that gets tranformer to a task in Triquetrum that then gets transformed to a Workflow. This should do something real for ICE. Maybe need to call back in to IC

Thus, the API and formatting is a bit baroque.

As you probably have gathered, the interface is defined in ptolemy/actor/lib/gui/PlotterBaseInterface.java, so implementing those methods would give you a good start on plotting something useful.

The harder part will be dealing with the configuration settings such as axis labels etc. and converting those from Ptplot to what ever plotter you are using.

The concern is that if a UC employee (someone who has signed the UC patent agreement, which includes funded students) unknowingly contribute software that is covered by a patent held elsewhere in the UC system, then there is a conflict.  One workaround is to have UC contributors sign an individual contributor agreement.

Jay pointed out that there is the possibility of dual licensing Triquetrum as other projects have proposed doing and presumably done so.

To close this bug, we need to:

1) Get the OK to use both licenses
2) Define what text goes in to files
3) Update the license files.

For 1) Get the OK to use both licenses, https://eclipse.org/legal/ says:

> Eclipse Distribution License (EDL): The BSD license used by some Eclipse projects which require 
> dual-licensing along with the EPL. Other than for example code or build scipts, use of this license by
> an Eclipse project is on a case-by-case basis and requires unanimous approval of the Board of 
> Directors. 

For 2) Define what text goes in to files
Some guidance may be found at https://eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#DUALLIC:

> For Eclipse projects which are dual-licensed, your file headers state that the code is being made 
> available under two licenses. For example: ""This program and the accompanying materials are made 
> available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and Eclipse Distribution License v. 1.0 
> which accompanies this distribution."" What is meant by the use of the conjunction ""and""?
> The code is being made available under both of the licenses. The consumer of the code can select 
> which license terms they wish to use, modify and/or further distribute the code under. 

For 3) Update the license files, this can be done if and when 1 and 2 are done.

Dual-licensing means that the contributions would come in under _both_ licenses, and the patent grants in the EPL would still apply.

To me the simplest solution is in your first paragraph: UC committers should sign the individual committer agreements. In fact, as far as I know UC is not a member of the Eclipse Foundation, so that is what UC committers would have to do in any event.

At least in previous discussions with them (for ICE) they refused to allow LBNL employees to create projects and release them under the EPL, but they were free to contribute to them subject to the ICA. 

I was also thinking about this from the standpoint of other Berkeley projects using Triquetrum and refusing to do so because of the EPL and UC's complaints against it. This was the big reason we requested dual licensing for EAVP: there are significant community projects who won't use it under the EPL.

So, I may have raised the idea of dual licensing without fully understanding the problem and for that I apologize. I think Mike is right that dual licensing doesn't solve the contribution problem.

Some projects at Berkeley were able to use the [Educational Community License, Version 2.0 (ECL-2.0)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ECL-2.0), which says:

Section 3 is:

> ""3. Grant of Patent License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.""

If the Eclipse Foundation and UC were able to agree on a similar license that was based on the EPL, then perhaps Triquetrum could have a single license, and organizations like UC Berkeley could join the Eclipse Foundation.  I realize that having Eclipse adopt a different license for some packages is not very practical and not very likely.  In addition, the patent clause in the EPL provides a modicum of protection for the users of the EPL-licensed software. Modifying the EPL to be like the ECL reduces that protection, which is also probably not palatable.

The downside is that UC won't agree to the the EPL as is, which means that UC cannot join the Eclipse Foundation.  This means that we are losing an opportunity to train students in how to directly collaborate as a part of their organization with the open source community.  Yes, UC students, staff and faculty may sign Individual Committer Agreements as a workaround, but we are missing out on an opportunity.

I believe I predicted that dual-licensing would not solve UC Berkley's concerns :)

Your post does not explain why having committers sign the Individual Committer Agreement would not suffice. Would you mind explaining that?

I'm not that proud of UC Berkeley, but I am (mostly) proud of what what 
Berkeley has done with open source software.  I don't like denying that 
I work at UC Berkeley.

Once it became clear that I would need to sign an ICA if I wanted to 
contribute, it made it rather pointless for Berkeley to join the Eclipse 
Foundation.  I was told that it would be difficult for Berkeley to join 
with the EPL as is.  If Berkeley joined, it might increase student 
participation in Eclipse projects and teach students how to work on open 
source projects.

In a perfect world, students, staff and faculty at UC would be able to 
contribute without executing ICAs.

I don't agree with the guidelines from the UC Office of the President, 
so I'm not that comfortable defending them.

I wouldn't be too hard on UC Berkley or the UC Office of the President. I believe that they're just [following the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act). 

It would be great if UC Berkley became a member, but the topic of this particular issue is dual-licensing Triquetrum. Could you clarify if the project itself is moving forward?

Yes!  Triquetrum is proceeding!  We have nightly builds that include RCP 
installers.  I'm giving a talk at about Triquetrum at EclipseCon NA and 
submitted a poster for another conference in June.

The patent question is a mess.  I'm not sure how much more I want to go 
into it :-)  Maybe over beer.

Anyway, I'm not sure if I should follow up to epl-discuss@eclipse.org, I 
think we have answered this here.

A Relation-with-Vertex also allows to indirectly connect multiple ports to a same single-port, via the Vertex. (1 link goes from the single-port to/from the relation's vertex, and from there multiple links can go to/from the other ports)

It would be virtually impossible to have to reprogram those using the default Graphiti shape-programming.
Ideally we should implement a generic thing that can create shapes or figures or ... from existing SVG fragments or Ptolemy icon definition XML.

Relevant info from forum msgs at

So GMF SVGFigure seems a possible approach :
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Graphical_Modeling_Framework/Tutorial/Part_2#Use_SVGFigure
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Graphical_Modeling_Framework/Models/GMFGraph#SVG

Download from :
https://www.eclipse.org/gmf-tooling/download.php

Besides SVG, Ptolemy also (mainly?) has an own set of graphical attribute types that are assembled in icon definition MOMLs.

The Apache one should pass without issues as it's a simple piggyback CQ.

Erwin and I discussed Bug #113 and he will update it.

At this point, we have a M1 release available on the [Eclipse download site](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.triquetrum/downloads)

After we get feedback about the release documents, we can create a RC1 build.

Probably the way to do this is to create a branch on this bug, update the version numbers, commit, push, pull the changes and then run the [Triquetrum Hudson Build](https://hudson.eclipse.org/triquetrum/job/triquetrum/).  Then, once we get things working and have a final production release, we need to update the Hudson Build so that we don't overwrite our 0.1.0 release and then create a new branch that has the new version numbers and commit, push and pull request that new version.  The devil is in the details of the versioning.  

See the [Tycho Versioning Plugin](https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-release/tycho-versions-plugin/plugin-info.html) for one way to do this.

To close this bug, we need to have the Triquetrum 0.1.0 downloads available and the nightly build building nightly installers.

This is the simplest approach to start with, but may not be ideal in the long run.

It is possible to split both models in separate files, which is what I did at the time for Passerelle as well (and there the workflow model was straight Ptolemy II MoML alongside the Graphiti XMI).
Some are in favour of the split approach, but it also has its downside : 2 files for one workflow ""ensemble"" are more difficult to share/version/keep-in-synch/... than 1 file.

Personally I am in favour to split it up, as my background is more in ""headless"" runtimes and we could imagine running the workflows without requiring Graphiti dependencies then.

So that's another option we could consider : the editor works in XMI (mixed or split, whatever), and outside of the editor we can still use Ptolemy MoML exports for runtime environments.
(although I don't consider this the best approach myself)

(Ptolemy MoML can also contain limited graphical info like icon types and (x,y) locations of the workflow elements, but it's much more focused on the actual workflow graph than on graphical diagram info.)

And one more thing to keep in mind : Triquetrum has a Java API org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.WorkflowRepositoryService that provides some encapsulation on the physical storage method, and returns only the ""pure"" workflow definition. So if we enforce the usage of that interface when integrating Triquetrum, the actual file format would be less important.

In Triquetrum, awhile back, I believe I noticed that strings like the 
value of a FileParameter were duplicated in the file.  This seems risky, 
so I prefer one file that has a minimal amount of duplicated information 
if possible.

FWIW, The Kepler workflow project uses .kar files which are zip files 
that contain a .moml (Ptolemy Model Markup Language) file and other 
information.  As a code maintainer, I find these files difficult to work 
with when doing operations on the files outside of the tools.  For 
example, sometimes it is necessary to update something in the files or 
clean something up.  In principle, using a  MoML filter to open the 
file, fix the problem and write the file is possible, but sometimes a 
quick and dirty script is much faster.

Another downside of a zip file is that the version control diffs are not 
that useful, though with some tooling it is possible to get meaningful 
information from diffing two .kar files

However, I think model users find the single .kar file to be helpful.  
My interactions with model files is not typical.

So, if we want to have multiple files, it might be nice to bundle them 
in one file, like what the Kepler workflow system does.  Or, I'm 
guessing Eclipse has something similar.

A non-graphical tool should be able to ignore any graphical information 
in the model description file.

For those of you unfamiliar with Ptolemy, ptolemy.moml.MoMLParser is 
used to parse the xml model description.  MoMLParser invokes filters 
that look for certain elements and perform certain operations.  For 
example, ptolemy.moml.filters.RemoveGraphicalClasses does what the name 
suggests.

In principle, using XSLT can do much of what the filters do, but with 
the filters we can inspect the model as it is being parsed.

One key thing to keep in mind is that a MoML file is not a complete 
description of the model because the model instantiates classes, which 
can include actor oriented classes, which are declarations of 
collections of actors that can be instantiated and extended.

In Ptolemy, the Sinewave composite is an actor-oriented class, so supporting this is fairly important.  However, we could also substitute in a non-actor-oriented class.

One possibility would be to initially only support setting parameters of actor-oriented classes, which is how Passerelle works.

Another issue is where do we store classes.  In Ptolemy, the AOC files are stored on the classpath, which is tricky in a OSGi environment.  This ties in to how do we store files in Triquetrum?  One file or two files?

Triquetrum uses Ptolemy II as its execution engine.  The Kepler Scientific Workflow System (https://kepler-project.org/) also uses Ptolemy II as its execution engine.  (BTW - when I refere to Kepler, I'm referring to the Kepler Scientific Workflow System which predates Kepler the Eclipse release, and probably predates the Kepler Lua package).

Kepler (Scientific Workflow System) does have support for Hadoop, see

http://users.sdsc.edu/~jianwu/JianwuWang_files/ICCS-bioKepler.pdf

https://kepler-project.org/developers/interest-groups/distributed/configuring-hadoop-for-biokepler-or-ddp-suite

My understanding of how Kepler's Distributed Data-Parallel (DDP) works is that it presents a facade for the different big data systems.   If I remember correctly, there are directors such as the Stratosphere Director that support a limited set of data types.  These directors handle the glue for the different big data systems.

Our goal with Triquetrum is to be able to support Kepler, but I have not yet tried it

Triquetrum does supporting adding actors, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Extending_Triquetrum

One thing that might be missing is that Kepler has a tabbed parameter editor that is not yet supported.

It would be helpful to try this before the ICCS talk on June 7, 2016.

The biggest issue is that the ExecutionChoice actor does not properly split the action code from the UI code, so it has dependencies on classes like KeplerGraphFrame, which extends ActorGraphFrame.  ActorGraphFrame is not a part of Triquetrum.
There are about 1600 errors still.  A number of them are Access restrictions.

For example KeplerClassChanges has this warning:

```
Description Resource    Path    Location    Type
Access restriction: The constructor 'ClassChanges()' is not API (restriction on required library '/Users/cxh/src/workspaceTriq04Mar/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/.bundle_pool/plugins/ptolemy.moml_11.0.0.201605041253.jar') KeplerClassChanges.java /org.kepler.triquetrum.ddpDemo/src/org/kepler/moml/filter   line 51 Java Problem
```

The code is

```
    /** Update Ptolemy's ClassChanges filter. */
    public static void initialize() {
        ptolemy.moml.filter.ClassChanges changes = new ptolemy.moml.filter.ClassChanges();
```

The problem is probably that ptolemy.moml.filter.ClassChanges is not exposed in the module.

As of June 7, 2016, porting the Kepler ExecutionChoice actor to Triquetrum is partially complete. The ExecutionChoice actor was chosen because it is an arbitrarily complex actor that would not be an easy port. The primary issue is that the ExecutionChoice code uses the Swing-based BasicGraphFrame code that is not present in Triquetrum. The next step would be to get the ptolemy.actor.lib.hoc.Case actor working in Triquetrum because the Case actor has internal models that need to be viewable. Right now, the UI uses ptolemy.vergil.modal.CaseGraphFrame and CaseGraphTableau, which use BasicGraphFrame, which is not present in Triquetrum because Triquetrum does not use the Swing-based viewer. After that, the next step would be to refactor ExecutionChoice to follow the Case example where the UI is in ptolemy.vergil.modal.CaseGraphFrame and CaseGraphTableau.

The current work is in checked in to a repository, see [Kepler Triquetrum Repository](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Kepler_Triquetrum_Repository).

So it's not an issue, not specific to your MacOSX, it's deliberate.

Reasons :
- the name & value doesn't fit anyway
- custom icons don't show them neither
- they were the reason that double-click didn't always work well to open 
  the config panel

If you would like to get them back, then I can add them.

But you're correct, the wiki screenshots need some updates

Oddly, this also happens in the current head with Mars.1, after reverting the pull requests.

For this bug to be close, we need to upgrade Triquetrum to Neon so that the splash screen shows Neon instead of Mars and the binaries need to be created by Tycho on the Hudson Triquetrum site at [https://hudson.eclipse.org/triquetrum/job/triquetrum/](https://hudson.eclipse.org/triquetrum/job/triquetrum/).

In theory, the plan is to ship the Science2016 Release on Neon, so this has Science2016Release as a mile stone.

We have a number of Ptolemy II OSGi bundles that have completed the Contribution Questionnaire process for third party libraries (see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contribution_Questionnaire#Third_Party_Libraries and Bug #70: Ipzilla issues for Triquetrum third party code)

If someone wants to add a Ptolemy actor that is in one of the packages in one of the bundles that have passed review, then either the bundle needs to be re-reviewed or the actor needs to be renamed.

In general, we don't want to request frequent reviews.

So, we should augment the system so that a bundle can register a MoMLFilter that will cause the MoMLParser to read in a model file that refers to the actor with the old ptII package name and instead look up the new Triquetrum package name.

However, it does not quite work yet.

Details below:

I have a p2 site set up as part of the osgi-2-0 build on http://terra.eecs.berkeley.edu:8080/job/ptIIosgi.  At the end of the build, the contents of releng/org.ptolemy.tycho.update/target/*\* are copied to ~www/cvswww/chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/. A symbolic link from ~www/cvswww/chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/p2/osgi-2-0 to ../releng/org.ptolemy.tycho.update/target/repository was created, so the update site may be found at https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/p2/osgi-2-0/

The problem is that if updating the tpd siteto use the new p2 site fails because the ptolemy classes are not found.

Details:

1) Close the org.eclipse.triquetrum.dependencies project.  Can we just delete this project?  If it is not closed, then you will get errors about ptolemy.vergil.kernel.attributes missing because that package is not present in the dependencies project.

2) Edit org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform.tpd so that the old site is not used and the new site is used:

```
// location ""http://users.telenet.be/triquetrum-ptolemy-p2/"" {
//      org.eclipse.triquetrum.ptolemy.feature.source.feature.group lazy
//        org.eclipse.triquetrum.ptolemy.feature.feature.group lazy
//}
location ""https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/p2/osgi-2-0/"" {
     org.ptolemy.tycho.feature.feature.group lazy
}
```

3) Right click on the tpd file and click on Create Target Definition File

org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform.target now contains:

```

<!-- generated with https://github.com/mbarbero/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform -->
...
    <location includeMode=""slicer"" includeAllPlatforms=""true"" includeSource=""false"" includeConfigurePhase=""true"" type=""InstallableUnit"">

      <repository location=""https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/p2/osgi-2-0/""/>
    </location>
```

4) Open the target and click on ""Set as Target Platform

5) The build will fail, there will be many problems because the ptolemy classes are not found.

However, if, in the target window (org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform.target), I press reload and then Set as Target Platform, the build works without problems!

If I save org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform.target, then it now contains:

If I edit content.xml from the chess site and remove

        <required namespace='org.eclipse.equinox.p2.iu' name='ptolemy.moml' range='11.0.0'/>
```

and then recreate content.jar and update it on the chess site, then creating the target file from the tpd file works!

So, the question is how to make it so that the content.xml file on the chess p2 update site does not include the duplicate requirements.

The jar files may be found via bug #70.

We should verify that the files that are submitted correspond with what is in the tree.

A branch or tag should be created in the osgi-2-0 repository to keep the state of what was submitted.  If we create a branch here, then we could continue to modify the osgi-2-0 branch until we are ready to submit a new set of jars.

The jar files that were submitted are what we should distribute via a p2 site.   We should create a separate static p2 site based on the previous site.  The site should contain both the source and class files.  We can create a directory in the osgi-2-0 branch that has the site and the jars.  The nightly Jenkins osgi-2-0 build can copy that directory to the Chess site.

The triquetrum tpd file should be updated to use the static p2 site that contains the approved jars.

The site build from the osgi-2-0 tree can remain in place for development.

```

The contents of the jar files were compared with the contents of the osgi-2-0 tree and updates made.  Note that the diva source jar file that was uploaded to IPZilla did not have the proper patch.  A new jar file was created and uploaded.  That jar file is above.

A branch of the osgi-2-0 branch was created to maintain the set of CQ'd jars.  To check out the branch of the branch, use:

```
svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/projects/eal/ptII/branches/osgi-2-0-cq-1 
```

The next step is to create a p2 site that includes the source jars and jar files containing .class files.  It is unclear to me whether the jar files containing .class files should have the same version number as the source jars, but it seems like they should.

sed  -i .bak 's/\(^Bundle-Name:.*\)/\1 (Incubation)/' */META-INF/MANIFEST.MF examples/*/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

I verified that the Mac download at https://hudson.eclipse.org/triquetrum/job/triquetrum/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/org.eclipse.triquetrum.repository/target/products/ has signed Triquetrum plugins and features.

To close this, we need to fix Bug #148 Make releases available on the Eclipse download server and Bug #145 Create a p2 update site and verify that the jars are signed.

In addition, we should sign the osgi-2-0 jar files with the Ptolemy II code signing certificate or create a separate issue with a later milestone.

Alternatively, might it not be better to move the ptolemy.feature project to the ptII repo altogether and provide that from the ptII p2 repo? This would resolve the licensing ambiguity and would also allow to include ""branding info"" in a designated ptolemy bundle (the about.ini stuff mentioned above) and show e.g. Ptolemy II logo and license/copyright info in the feature details.

When exporting the Triq RCP product (for win 64 bit), running  a workflow with a python actor runs well.

When launching the product from inside my Triquetrum workspace I can try python scripts in 2 ways, in the same running equinox instance :
- using the osgi console runScript test command (from org.eclipse.triquetrum.python.service.example): then it works fine
- using the same workflow as mentioned above and launching it from the editor : the PythonService.getActiveClient(int) never obtains an active response.

In that last case, the getActiveClient() keeps getting errors in the line :  
`final Object active = client.request(""isActive"", new Object[] { ""unused"" });`

The error is :
""org.apache.xmlrpc.XmlRpcException: Failed to read servers response: Connection refused: connect"". 
The retry loop keeps on trying until timeout...

The python.exe process is running, and is never terminated.

When running the script using the runScript test cmd, the same code gets executed as in the workflow actor, from inside the same running platform. And then the client.request() invocation has a success response form the 1st try. (and the python.exe is correctly terminated at the end as well)

The test model is in [testPython.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/files/465897/testPython.zip)
1. update your local triq repo to current master
2. run the /org.eclipse.triquetrum.repository/Triquetrum.product from inside your workspace
3. create a plain test project in your triq editor RCP
4. unzip and copy the attached model in your test project and run it

You should get a timeout exception after a while.

Now export the product and run it outside of your workspace and try the same. The python actor should work fine then.

Now back in your eclipse workspace, add the bundle org.eclipse.triquetrum.python.service.example to your launch configuration and run again from your workspace. The workflow should still go in timeout, but now you can try from the OSGi console something like : 

osgi> runScript helloworld input1=hi input2=ho
hello world : hi and ho
{output3={key1=hi, key2=ho}, output4=hey, output1=1, output2=[D@7c4c8b0d, output5={key1=hey there, key2=3, key3=[Ljava.lang.Object;@1e2bb6c6}, output0=1}
osgi>

i.e. the script integration works fine then, from the same running platform as the RCP editor.

After running a local mvn build, I see there are p2 repositories generated in both of their target folders.

When installing from the p2 repo in the ...repository project, in a fresh Neon RCP edition, I get a functional Triquetrum editor.

When doing the same from the ...update project, the editor is only partially functional.

Remark that when trying the same with Neon.1 there are some warnings about mismatched feature versions during the install and the editor is also partially crippled...

The p2 repo in the ...repository project contains probably an (almost) complete RCP including all kinds of eclipse IDE bundles, as it's based on a product build. So the trick will be to find the minimal subset of all those plugins/features that is installable in a plain Neon and results in a working Triquetrum...

When running or installing from a product, the start instructions and levels are applied from the product definition. When installing from the update site though (as defined in the ...update project), not all bundles area started. And that causes all kinds of triq services to be missing, including those to obtain the ptolemy actor classes, UI module declarations, workflow execution svc etc.

To get this resolved the following things are needed : 
- add more detailed dependencies in the different feature.xmls + define the update sites where they can be found
- add p2.inf instruction files next to the MANIFESTs of the bundles that must be started (to run their activator, get DS components activated etc)

The p2.inf task has impact both on the ptolemy bundles and in Triquetrum.

There is a problem with the javadoc Tycho module, so I've commented it out.

I created a separate Hudson build job so that we can experiment with this without disturbing the regular build, see https://hudson.eclipse.org/triquetrum/job/triquetrum.milestone/

One possible issue is that after ""mvn clean compile"", org.eclipse.triquetrum.repository/target did not exist.  It is probably safer to run ""mvn clean verify"", see http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html#starting-the-build

So, we can modify the triquetrum.milestone build to run ""mvn clean verify"" once and then experiment with running the ant command.

At this point, the triquetrum.milestone build is failing because the directory is not present.  We are currently waiting on directory creation, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501955

If we submit a release questionnaire on 9/13 or 9/14, is that sufficient time for the October 21 release date?  It seems like two weeks is sufficient, but I just wanted to double check.  I'm aware of https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#release-review, which says that the release review process takes a week and that the release reviews take place on the first and third Wednesdays.  My intention was to create a release on Tuesday 9/13 via the ""Create a Release"" under the committer tools.

It is not yet possible to change a port between input&output, and the current cfg dialog has some unergonomic duplicate concepts. I.e. an actor has an input port list and an output port list but still the user must check the port types as well.

I would leave that until after the release, as the solution for this involves a non-trivial change in the underlying EMF model.

The EMF model has been adapted to have one list of all ports, combined with getters for input ports and output ports. The actor config dialog now has a single table for all ports, with the checkboxes to mark them as input/output/multiport. When changing from input to output and vice-versa, the actor shape is updated after Ok-ing.

Two open issues remain : 
- how to block the properties of the ports defined in the actor code (similarly to Ptolemy vergil's approach, while allowing them to be editable for dynamically added ports. This seems to be difficult/impossible with EMF forms viewmodels. Maybe need to check out EMF Parsley that uses DSLs i.o. declarative models.
- define the port layout for ports that are both input&output (and what about ports that are marked as neither?

I've merged work that should fix most of the port type-changing issues:
- The actor configuration panel has been simplified to just show one port table.
- Ports can be changed between input&output (or both)
- Added a ""direction"" concept (similar to Ptolemy) to place ports on one of the 4 actor sides

There is an annoying issue in the port table in the actor config dialog : enums don't get rendered yet as comboboxes, but as plain text. When opening the port cfg dialog from that table, it gets rendered as combo though. I've reported this to EMF forms and it should be resolved soon : 
- forum : https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1084921/
- bugzilla : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513592

Still to do : rotate the port shape to always point inwards for an input & outwards for an output.
For the moment it still always points from left-to-right.

Can you try this out already and let me know what you think about it?

thanks

The errors are coming from the Equinox Declarative Services startup, as 
we've still got detailed logging activated.
But the DS service retries a couple of times and then finds the 
components. So this should not impact the workbench state after the full 
startup is finished.

For the moment we don't have a custom perspective yet. To get started, 
you just need to create a plain eclipse project in your workspace and 
then do a File > New > Other and select the Triquetrum entry in the 
Workflows section.

This is documented on https://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Getting_Started

Can you try if that works for you? Let me know if there would still be 
an issue.

Remark that the actual actors available in the editor are still limited.
I have attached 2 sample workflows that you could copy in your project 
to play with (hope this gets attached correctly to the github issue, 
from a simple email reply)

regards
erwin

The welcome screen hasn’t worked yet for me, i.e. also not before the folder restructuring.

We need to check that topic separately I think.

 

The Eclipse Project explorer indeed does not show projects in subfolders, as far as I know.

We might define so-called “working sets” that correspond to folders, if you prefer.

(I think the Eclipse WTP project has hierarchical project views, but that’s for doing Java Enterprise dvp, not RCP)

- Added org.eclipse.triquetrum.ui.e4 to org.eclipse.triquetrum.core.feature
- Updated the depencies of org.eclipse.triquetrum.core.feature by selecting Compute in the Dependencies tab.
- Added required features in the content page fof the Triquetrum.product by selecting Add Required.
- Deleted the current run configuration and created a new one from the product defintion.
- Added -clearPersistedState to the Arguments tab of the run configuration.

There is an option for changing preferences on a per project basis but doing so should be an exception rather than the norm. Global default values should be common for all projects created and should be set to reasonable defaults **once** by the user and or a priori. Using the preference store is very useful for presenting and setting values when artifacts are created by the IDE such as when a project creation wizard is run or some configuration file is generated.

Given the above. Which are the global preferences neeeded? Can those global preference be categorized into groups of different functionality?

Cfr the 2 examples mentioned in the original issue description :

The workflow execution service now assigns by default a nr of execution 
threads corresponding to the available CPU cores.
This is a valid default choice, but an (advanced) user may want to tune 
that.

The actor library/palette is currently defined through plugin extension 
points.
Users may want to hide/add actors to personalize their palette via 
preferences.

and then unzip it and then click on Eclipse.app, I get a dialog about the app being from an unknown developer.

The workaround is to right click on Eclipse.app and select Open.

The fix to this is to make sure that we are signing Eclipse.app

The Windows version probably has a similar issue.

We could ship 0.0.1 without this being fixed.

There is some info and examples on signing applications during the build being discussed on cbi-dev : http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cbi-dev/msg01776.html

There are win and mac signer plugins that can be configured in the pom.
It would seem this is something different from signing individual jars.

I'm not sure if this should block the release, but I think we could ship 0.1.0 with this issue not fixed.

It's at https://github.com/erwindl0/triquetrum-capecode

I've added all required deps in my workspace (by hand), i.e. vert.x core + netty + jackson and am able to start-up this extended Triquetrum. But when the AccessorLibrary tries to load the test accessor from the locally contained index.json and BaseA.js, I get an error related to required js files : 

Loading accessor failed: BaseA.js

Thanks for taking a look at this.

Yes, Ptolemy II looks in the classpath to find resources like basicFunctions.js.  I'm not sure how this will work with OSGi.  It is not just the JavaScript actor that looks in the classpath for resources, models can look for resources if the resource starts with $CLASSPATH.  

We had to solve a number of issues surrounding resource loading for WebStart.   See ptolemy/actor/gui/JNLPUtilities.java and nameToFile() and nameToURL() in ptolemy/util/FileUtilities.java

I need to investigate this in more detail, but a first quick thought is that we may need to change the code in JavaScript and/or FileUtilities to try to be compatible with both standard Ptolemy II/Vergil and with Triquetrum/OSGi. Or in the worst case fork the code in the osgi-2.0 branch from ptII trunk...

It would probably be best if methods in FileUtilities were modified so that they work with OSGi bundles.   For example ptolemy.actor.lib.jjs.JavaScript has a getResource() method that invokes FileUtilities.nameToURL().  So, if we fix up nameToURL(), we fix this in many places.  The main thing about FileUtilities.java is that it should not depend on OSGi classes at compile or run time.  Thus, any changes to FileUtilities.java that use OSGi classes should use reflection to invoke OSGi-specific methods.

I ran in to similar issues with WebStart, where a .jnlp file lists a series of jar files that can contain resources.  With WebStart, a class could look in the classpath for any resource and the classpath included all the jar files.  This is an old school POJO way of resource lookup, but is probably not compatible with OSGi, where jar files are supposed to be more opaque.   

The reality is that models expect to be able to use $CLASSPATH to get any resource that is in the ptII repo.

Below are the notes:

[Hallvard Traetteberg](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/hal) visited the Ptolemy group in 2012-2013 and did a first cut of creating Ptolemy II OSGi bundles. Hallvard also developed some Xtext work, see https://github.com/hallvard/ptolemy. Hallvard has not been using Ptolemy much recently, but his work is there.

Ptcl was a TCL-based language for Ptolemy Classic. The [ptcl manual](http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyclassic/almagest/docs/user/pdf/ptcl.pdf) might be of use to help define some of the Xtext commands. For example, both will need to connect ports from an outer composite to an inner composite.

https://github.com/rtotaro/triquetrum.git and added a branch with his work.

Rodolfo, Erwin and I had a teleconference where Rodolfo demonstrated being able to create and connect actors and to modify an existing model.

A proposed name is Tqcl for TriQuetrum Command Language.

During the call, we agreed that the Ptcl syntax is very Ptolemy Classic-specific and should be used only as a rough guide.

The next steps are:
1) Erwin will work with Rodolfo on getting his code into the the master.  
2) Erwin will work with Rodofo on getting Rodolfo committer status on the Triquetrum project
3) Rodolfo will work on extending the language to support a flat model such as what is in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Opening_A_Model.  
4) A future task would be for Christopher to create a Ptolemy II code generator that would read MoML files and generate Tqcl output.  We could eventually use this for round trip testing, where we read in MoML files, generate Tqcl output, then read the Tqcl and run the model.
5) Future work would include supporting hierarchy
6) Future work would include support actor oriented classes, see Bug #78 
7) Future work could include recording the steps a user makes while using a GUI for later playback.

You can just ignore it, i.e. you can still launch Triquetrum and it works fine.

It seems that a Jetty upgrade was done (which is a dependency of the Eclipse Help system), which introduced new optional ""capability requirements"". While the Neon PDE Product editor/launch does not handle the ""optional"" nature correctly.

It would be handy for new Triquetrum developers/contributors to have such a ""Triquetrum development"" Oomph setup available.

For the moment, this would be about using an Eclipse Neon RCP/RAP IDE + a Triquetrum workspace configured on our current target platform (Oxygen).

Probably to replicate this, it is necessary to remove the Eclipse Oomph installer directory and untar the distribution.

To close this, we should consider fixing the above.

Also, to close this, we should add Triquetrum to the list of available installations.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTU3MTM2Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

See Bug #116: Make the ptII source and class files that passed CQ IP review available via a p2 site.

To see what changed:

```
svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/projects/eal/ptII/branches/osgi-2-0-cq-1 
svn co https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/projects/eal/ptII/branches/osgi-2-0
diff -rwb -x .svn osgi-2-0-cq-1 osgi-2-0 >& ~/tmp/osgi-2-0-cq-1-diff.txt
```
See [osgi-2-0-cq-1-diff.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/files/950303/osgi-2-0-cq-1-diff.txt)

Summary of the diffs:
* org.terraswarm.accessor is a new directory, see Bug #18 (Create a CapeCode Triquetrum product)
  * osgi-2-0/org.terraswarm.accessor/original-src/ptolemy/actor/lib/conversions/json/{JSONToToken.java,TokenToJSON.java} are new files
  * osgi-2-0/org.terraswarm.accessor/original-src/ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs has lots of code that is from external sources and might be difficult to get through CQ because the licenses are not compatible.
* There are various changes to pom.xml and MANIFEST.MF files that don't need to be CQ'd.
*  ptolemy.actor.lib2 is new and would need to be CQ'd.  We might want to add more classes here, or update ptolemy.actor.lib
  * osgi-2-0/ptolemy.actor.lib2/original-src/ptolemy/actor/lib2/{Bernoulli.java,      BooleanMultiplexor.java,BooleanSelect.java,BooleanSwitch.java}
  * osgi-2-0/ptolemy.actor.lib2/src/main/java/ptolemy/actor/lib2/activator{Activator.java,                        AliasModelElementClassProvider.java}
* ptolemy.core has some changes:
  * osgi-2-0/ptolemy.core/original-src/ptolemy/data/{AWTImageToken.java,ImageToken.java} are new and would need to be CQ'd.
  * osgi-2-0/ptolemy.core/original-src/ptolemy/data/expr/Constants.java has a new method: nameToType() and some other minor changes.  This would need to be CQ'd.
  * osgi-2-0/ptolemy.core/original-src/ptolemy/util/{ExecuteCommands.java,                     StreamExec.java,StringBufferExec.java} are new and would need to be CQ'd.
  * osgi-2-0/ptolemy.core/src/org/ptolemy/classloading/osgi/OSGiClassLoadingStrategy.java  has some minor changes that would need to be CQ'd.
* osgi-2-0/ptolemy.gui/original-src/ptolemy/actor/gui/JNLPUtilities.java has a new method: getResourceSaveJarURLAsTempFile() that would need to be CQ'd.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjUxNDgxNQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Below is the diff between osgi-2-0/ptolemy.actor.lib/pt-jar.files and the proposed changes:

[pt-jar.files.diff.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/files/1253870/pt-jar.files.diff.txt)


Note that CapeCode opens the following actors that are not part of the ptolemy.actor.lib bundle

I modified ./releng/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform.target and successfull rebuilt.

./releng/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform/org.eclipse.triquetrum.target.platform.tpd would also need to be updated.

The next steps would be:

- [x] Check in changes that use the new p2 repo
- [x] Add the new actors to the list of actors listed in Triquetrum, see [Extending Triquetrum](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Extending_Triquetrum)

So, I'm reopening this bug.  To close it:

- [ ] Update  https://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Extending_Triquetrum#Adding_preexisting_Java_actor_classes_to_a_OSGi_actor_module with instructions about how to adjust the icons

Summary of the diffs:

- [ ] org.terraswarm.accessor is not to be submitted for review as it includes many different packages that will be difficult to get through the Eclipse IP process.  See Bug #18 (Create a CapeCode Triquetrum product)

- [ ] ptolemy.actor.lib2 is not to be submitted for review.

- [ ] osgi-2-0-cq-1/features/org.ptolemy.tycho.feature/feature.xml refers to org.terraswarm.accessor in a commented out section, which is not a problem.

- [ ] osgi-2-0/pom.xml 
- [ ] * updated use Tycho 1.0.0. Not a problem
- [ ] * Mentions org.terraswarm.accessor and org.json in comments. Not a problem.
- [ ] * Includes codesigning work.  Not a problem

- [ ]  ptolemy.actor.lib c**ontains a number of new files** that would need reviewing.  This is the bulk of the work.  The new files are below:

It looks like the bundles that need to be cq'd are 

- [x] ptolemy.actor.lib
- [x] ptolemy.core
- [x] ptolemy.gui
- [x] ptolemy.moml

A few comments:
* diva: From the osgi-2-0 repo, I've removed README.txt, package.html and makefile along with some other files that are not in the diva bundle that were not cq'd.  The next build will not have these files
* The modules in https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/p2/osgi-2-0-2/plugins/ are signed, the modules that we submitted in the cq last year are not.
* There are some trivial, non-functional changes in some of the modules such as comments that can be ignored
* It seems that the versions that were cq'd have plugins.properties files, yet the versions I've created at https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/p2/osgi-2-0-2/plugins/ do not.  For example, the version of ptolemy.diva from https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/attachment.cgi?id=14738 has a plugins.properties file that contains:

```
##Source Bundle Localization                                                                                   
#Wed Feb 10 15:51:53 CET 2016                                                                                  
pluginName=diva.source
```
Is it a problem that the new bundles do not?

* Here are the diffs before I removed the files from diva and updated the version numbers:
[ptcqdiffs.tar.gz](https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/files/1260745/ptcqdiffs.tar.gz)

* I've updated the p2 repo at https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/triq/p2/osgi-2-0-2/with updated version numbers in MANIFEST.MF and with the files remove from diva. (The diff above predates this update).

* Also updated Triquetrum to use the latest files in the p2 repo.

The detailed version updates for changed packages/bundles are a nice detail! (cfr semantic versioning)

The properties files for internationalization are not an issue. My impression is that they are a result of the build, and the difference between the CQ-ed and new source jars is related to a change in Tycho's approach I think : http://git.eclipse.org/c/tycho/org.eclipse.tycho.git/commit/?id=f290bd4e4ed15a23d231a04a402faf94b99d3213

For the feature version : wouldn't you use the highest Ptolemy bundle version nr, i.e. 11.1.0 in this case?

I didn’t bother yet to look for (automated) model migration tools (which EMF and its related frameworks probably do allow to build).

Subject: [eclipse/triquetrum] The model ICEdemo1.zip fails to open (#220)

 

While working on bug #89 <https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/issues/89>  Mac OS X: actor parameter values are not visible in the icons, I wanted to check the screenshots in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Opening_A_Model

http://wiki.eclipse.org/File:ICEdemo1.zip contains ICEDemo1.tdml.

Opening ICEDemo1.tdml fails with a "" The feature 'outputPorts' is not a valid feature"" message.

I tried to recreate the model but bug #219 <https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/issues/219>  Model with RecordDissassembler results in unreachable actors prevented me from doing so.

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The feature 'outputPorts' is not a valid feature

I updated Triquetrum.product: -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.8

I verified that under Java 1.7, we get an error dialog:
<img width=""399"" alt=""screen shot 2017-04-24 at 8 14 43 am"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/861991/25344228/51a058ce-28c6-11e7-8819-506f3a721aff.png"">

The above dialog says:

```
Version 1.7.0_55 of the JVM is not suitable for
this product.  Version: 1.8 or greater is required

I downloaded the Oxygen RC2 installer from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index-developer.php and followed the instructions in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Building_From_Sources which clearly state to select Neon.

See also Bug #211: Provide an Oomph setup for a Triquetrum developer

However, as a test, I selected Oxygen and the following error occurred:

Its purpose is to be able to open/edit files that are not in your workspace.

 

The behavior you would like is in the File -> Import menu item.

 

So I would prefer to stick to the general behavior/expectations of those 2 actions.

You can just drag-n-drop into your Eclipse project or use Import -> General > Filesystem and then select the file and the desired import location in your workspace/project.

As we need no “processing” for a tdml file, only a plain copy, that is sufficient.

 

But we may add an explicit import type under triquetrum for tdml as well, that does the plain copy.

I'm splitting this off from Bug #169 Create Welcome Support because the Welcome Support is almost done and cheat sheets are new work.

1.  Created org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor/splash.bmp

2. Added splash.bmp to org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor/build.properties

3. In org.eclipse.triquetrum.repository/Triquetrum.product, Splash tab, updated the Location to be `org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor`

Note that running Triquetrum by clicking on Launch an Eclipse Application in the Triquetrum.product editor will **use the Eclipse splash**, not the Triquetrum splash.  Under Mac OS X, to use the Triquetrum splash, run

```
mvn clean verify
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
unzip .././releng/org.eclipse.triquetrum.repository/target/products/org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.rcp.incubation-0.2.0.qualifier-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.zip
open triquetrum-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.app

As the Triquetrum editor is getting more features (e.g. repository view, dynamic palette etc) while we're still refactoring underlying elements and models, we need automated tests to prevent regression issues.

Some basic test scenarios to start with (pls add more in comments) : 
1. Test wizard to create a new workflow model. Result must be a new diagram editor with correct name.
2. Create HelloWorld model, with an SDF director, Const & Display actors, no actor config. (need to try out creating connections in RCPTT) And run it : check console output for execution success.
3. Test actor/director in-place rename
4. Test actor/director/parameter rename via cfg dialog
5. Test more advanced actor configuration : add a port (e.g. with RecordDisassembler actor)

This does not happen with all strings, but seems to always happen when first letter is an 'f'. Also, this bug doesn't not occur in Linux, only in Windows. Workaround is to restart the editor.

Weird stuff happening in there that I don’t get in my vanilla Triquetrum…

 

Is it possible to share some more info on your palette implementation :

*	Which Triquetrum version are you using?
*	Do you use the Triquetrum extension points to declare palette entries and/or an implementation of org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.palette.spi.PaletteEntryProvider ?
*	Or did you hook into org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.palette.ui.PaletteTreeViewer in a different way?
*	Any customizations of palette-related code in Triquetrum?
*	What kind of icons do you use?

 

It would help if you would be able to share related parts of your code?

(Alex?),

 

I think you’ve pasted the video link for your other issue about palette icon sizes.

Can you check and give the link to the drop-related video?

I’m interested to see the video, maybe the DnD hover icons will tell me a bit more about what might be happening.

 

As I guess you’re not using the Triquetrum editor itself, I wonder how you’ve implemented the drop target and/or the link between palette entries and a CombinedTemplateCreationEntry and Graphiti create&add features.

 

Also, do you get any Graphiti errors in your logs?

 

Thanks

Erwin

 

P.s. you’re hitting some Stranger Things for sure…

It seems it's not an error during the drop & creation logic, but rather that the location refuses the drop.

About the Director : Triquetrum/Ptolemy only allows 1 director per model, so for a second Director that's an expected refusal.

But the other drop failures seem to be related to the drop location hitting an actor that's already close to it? The actor label is rendered in a completely different way during the drag, than what I'm used to seeing on my (windows) dvp machine. 

Maybe the location/geometry calculations are different on Ubuntu...

Christopher can you check on Mac?

I'll get an Ubuntu system and try to reproduce this.

We need to figure out how to adapt the build to eliminate those from the download packages.

This may be related to the fact that the ptolemy p2 is offering all of those? Would tycho include them in our build then even when they're not referred to???

For your reference, Ptolemy II has the ability to export an image of a pre-canned workflow that can be put up on a web page and that is mouse sensitive so that it is possible to click on the image of an actor and see the values of the parameter and the values of a plot.   

A partially working example can be found at https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII10.0/ptII10.0.1/ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Spectrum/Spectrum/

The parameter view is not working, I can take a look, but it is possible to navigate the model and look at the plot.

There are notes at https://wiki.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/Main/HTMLExport

I don't believe that the export facility is included in the OSGi bundles, but it would not be that hard.  The starting point is ptolemy.vergil.basic.export.ExportModel

I'd be happy to help with this, I'm familiar with the code and it would not be much effort on my part.

The advantage of using starting with this code is that it handles a bunch of the things that would need to be handled like hierarchy.

a dialog pops up that says:

> “triquetrum-0.3.0” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.

The reason this occurs is because the quarantine attribute is set. 

```
bash-3.2$ ls -l@ ~/Downloads/org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.rcp.incubation-0.3.0*
-rw-r--r--@ 1 cxh  staff  180528035 Oct  8 21:07 /Users/cxh/Downloads/org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.rcp.incubation-0.3.0-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.zip

        com.apple.quarantine           58
```

 To remove the quarantine attribute, use `xattr` on the application:
```
xattr -d ~/Downloads/ triquetrum-0.3.0.app
```
Then try to restart Triquetrum.

If that does not work, then try using `xattr` on the zip file and then unzipping again:

```
cd ~/Downloads
rm -rf triquetrum-0.3.0
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.rcp.incubation-0.3.0-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.zip

A dialog appears:

```
The following problems were detected:
org.apache.xmlrpc.server:
Missing Constraint: org.apache.commons.logging; version=""[1.1.0,1.2.0)""
```
Indeed, .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/.bundle_pool/plugins/org.apache.xmlrpc.server_3.1.3.v20181004-1955.jar:meta-inf/manifest.mf contains:
```
Import-Package: org.apache.commons.logging;version=""[1.1.0,1.2)""
```

I believe that the issue here is that some of the versions of org.apache.xmlrpc.server are very old and was relying on org.apache.commons.logging 1.1.0.  Upgrading to Eclipse 2019-12 ended up requiring org.apache.commons.logging 1.2.0 somehow.

For a similar issue, see [Eclipse Bug 537832: org.eclipse.platform.feature.group fails to install due to missing org.apache.commons.logging 1.1.1](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=537832)

The correct fix would be to update where ever we got the bogus  `*.xmlrpc.server*.jar`.

Another fix would be to remove org.eclipse.triquetrum.scisoft.analysis.rpc.  It looks like org.eclipse.triquetrum.python.service/target/MANIFEST.MF imports it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/342/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If one wraps a collection of items unknown in advance (e.g. wrapping services into actors) it would be nice to have some kind of dynamism here.

I see two possible options:

1. ModelElementClassProvider service registrations could carry the metadata required as service-properties, this would also allow to register the same actor class multiple times (currently each actor has to have its own class name to be used with the extension point), e.g.
groupName=""My Dynamic Group""
displayName=""The Actor""

2. Add some kind of GroupProviderService that is queried for the necessary information by given an actor class, e.g.
GroupProviderService#getGroupName(Object actor);
GroupProviderService#getDisplayName(Object actor);

I started something similar in Triquetrum with org.eclipse.triquetrum.processing.actor.TaskBasedActor.

It's built on the concept of submitting a Task that is then picked up by a task broker and service implementation based on configured task type.

So if you can wrap existing logic/classes in OSGi services that implement org.eclipse.triquetrum.processing.service.TaskProcessingService, this approach for a generic actor may be of help.

There is some info on this approach on https://wiki.eclipse.org/Triquetrum/Task-based_processing
Trial/example implementations can be found in org.eclipse.triquetrum.processing.service.impl.example and org.eclipse.triquetrum.processing.test.

There are also actor implementations where the actual actor logic can be implemented in Python or Javascript, as another approach to have a limited palette and then extra configuration in the actor itself to pick the desired behaviour/implementation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDgwMzUzMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So there would be only one palette entry by default.

The role of the actor implementation shifts in this way from the default strategy in Ptolemy. By default in PtII the actor is a well-defined component with its specific responsibility/behaviour (i.e. one separate actor implementation per required functionality). But with this task/service-based approach the actor's role becomes mainly input/result data-binding within a data processing flow.

As such the PtII/Triquetrum model becomes just one of the available options to orchestrate a sequence of tasks.

From our experience, it may still be handy to have some specific actor implementations for specific/complex task types or at least to have custom configuration panels. Then you would still see those as separate palette entries (and need to add them in the plugin.xmls to get there).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjM2MDQ4MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Or even an UnivarianteFunction....

But it would still be good to have each one as one palette item (as I simply can iterate over a list of implementations and create new StorelessUnivariateStatisticWrapper(...).

Do you think that would be possible or are the palette items strictly bound to the Ptolemy Actor model? What I have in mind would be something like a Service interface that provides the following attributes:

- an id (e.g. StorelessUnivariateStatisticWrapper.Mean)
- the label
- the group
- an icon
- a factory method that creates a new Object instance that is an PtolemyClass  (in this case StorelessUnivariateStatisticWrapper)

and then appears in the palette as if
- I have created a dedicated class
- I have created a corresponding  plugin.xml created

This would greatly simplify the integration of existing functionality into Triquetrum.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjM4NDk1Ng==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Ok, that is a different approach and is indeed possible, already now in Triquetrum.

The plugin.xml-based approach is handled in  org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.palette.TriqPaletteBehavior.handlePaletteEntry(PaletteContainer, IConfigurationElement, IConfigurationElement)

You can define a palette group for which the individual entries can be provided by custom implementations of org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.palette.spi.PaletteEntryProvider. (cfr lines 122-137 in TriqPaletteBehavior)

One such implementation is already in Triquetrum: org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.palette.UserLibraryPaletteEntryProvider.

This adds dynamic entries to the palette, based on previously created models that the user wants to reuse as compositeactors / submodels.

An example of how to configure this is in /org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor/plugin.xml

   <extension point=""org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.paletteContribution"">
      <group
            displayName=""User Library""
            provider=""org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.editor.palette.UserLibraryPaletteEntryProvider"">
      </group>
   </extension>

cheers

I think that's feasible, but would need to investigate if it's really operational.

great stuff! I'll check the PR asap.

Replacing/customizing the actor configuration dialog per type of actor is not really feasible at this moment I'm afraid.
The approach based on EMF Forms ties a form's view model to an EMF type. As we have just one base EMF Actor type, this is quite limited now. I would need to check if EMF Forms has features to inject custom view models or so, but that will probably not be easy if there's no corresponding structure within the ecore model.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjExMzc0Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When attempt to edit the parameters of a SDF Director or an actor, the parameter window is displayed, which is a change from before when I got the NPE.  However, now I get another NPE:

BTW - I found [Bug 566073 - NPE for Detail Editing ""WithDialog"" on a TableControl](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566073), which is recent (2020-08-14) and which has a similar stack trace as above.

I tried using release 117 and 125, and with either one, I get a different looking window that does not include the parameters and looks fairly generic:

<img width=""498"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-08-30 at 9 21 00 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/861991/91660120-3bf90b00-eaa2-11ea-9117-dc6f41842ec9.png"">

The [Eclipse EMF Client Platform 1.7.0 Release]( https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.ecp/releases/1.7.0/bugs) is not much help.

So, it looks like the next steps would be to migrate Triquetrum to a more recent version of ECP, or see if [Bug 566073 - NPE for Detail Editing ""WithDialog"" on a TableControl](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566073) gets fixed.

I installed EMF into my Eclipse and updated the tpd file from ECP 115 to 124. 

Opening some of the views in triquetrum/plugins/editor/org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.model.viewmodel/viewmodels/ resulted in them being migrated automatically.  For example, Annotation.view had this line inserted:

```
<ecorePaths>/org.eclipse.triquetrum.workflow.model/model/triquetrum.ecore</ecorePaths>
```
However Actor.view did not migrate until I removed 

```
       <columnConfigurations xsi:type=""org.eclipse.emf.ecp.view.table.model:WidthConfiguration"" xmi:id=""_p1SGkO_1EeeD8PPv-i-9PA"" columnDomainReference=""_RynNcOepEea6NtatxyB-pg"" weight=""30"" minWidth=""80""/>

```
and 
```

This improved matters because now I can see the parameters.  However, when I try to edit the iterations parameter of an SDF Director, I get:

I tried to replicate [Bug 566073 - NPE for Detail Editing ""WithDialog"" on a TableControl](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566073), but I was not able to get the test case to fail.

At this point, I'm going to stop working on this issue and work on some of the other releng issues for the 0.4.0 release.  Unfortunately, after today I won't have much time to spend on Triquetrum until after 9/16.

I started on the migration, see my comment above, but it did not solve the problem.

If I remove these lines from Actor.view:

```
Then the migration of Actor.view works.

If I remove similar lines from Composite.view, then the migration works.

Editing the parameters of an actor or director works much better, the values of the parameters are visible.  However, when I try to edit a parameter, I get a NPE, see above.

I've created a branch called [cxbrooks/bug/353/NPE-parameters-1](https://github.com/eclipse/triquetrum/tree/cxbrooks/bug/353/NPE-parameters-1) that has the changes to Actor.view and Composite.view and then has the `.view` files migrated.   

I'm hesitant to merge these changes in to the master because I have no idea how EMF/ECP forms work and I especially don't understand what the `<columnConfiguration` does.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/triquetrum/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDc4OTAzMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
