In the diagram, you can see the topological relationships at the granularity of services, including the provider and the consumer, as well as their availability and invoke number. In the picture, you can also see yellow or red lines, which indicate lower availability. At this point, you can click on the node with lower availability to delve deeper and investigate the root cause of the issue. By clicking layer by layer, you can eventually pinpoint which service or infrastructure is responsible for the service unavailability.

As the Double 11 (November 11th) shopping festival approached, in order to better execute the related promotional activities, almost all business units conducted advanced load testing and drills on their services. They also adjusted their capacity based on the drill results. Additionally, this year, the group's product launch event was scheduled close to Double 11, which made everyone pay even more attention to this event. As a result, they allocated larger buffer space and expanded their infrastructure for a safer and more significant capacity increase. Everything was in place, waiting for the launch event to begin.

### The Scene of the Incident:

After thorough preparations, the entire group eagerly entered the live broadcast segment of the launch event. During the live sales and promotional phase, due to a sudden surge in traffic and a significant increase in data volume, error messages started to grow exponentially. The primary tool for monitoring application performance, ""oz-hera,"" used by the group, began to show abnormal service metrics. With the influx of traffic, the number of error messages continued to increase, and the amount of erroneous data being queried also grew rapidly. Since Prometheus API does not support pagination and limit restrictions, it attempted to fetch all metric data at once, causing a data overload that exceeded the page's loading capacity, ultimately leading to a page crash.

**_Investigation Data:_**
1. Prometheus raw data query time - approximately 50 seconds.
2. Backend data query time exceeded 1 minute in total.
3. Page loading took more than 2 minutes, and the page failed to load properly, resulting in a crash.
Due to the extended delay in viewing the data, multiple individuals continuously attempted to refresh the page, increasing the query load on Prometheus, which further slowed down the query speed, and the page waiting time continued to increase.


### Problem Analysis

Upon observation, it was found that due to the lack of pagination, the backend did not impose an overall data size limit, and the frontend also lacked segmented loading design. This resulted in loading an excessive amount of data in a single request, ranging from 6,000 to 10,000+ records. A rough estimate suggests that the data sent to the frontend may reach gigabytes in size, ultimately leading to extended waiting times and page crashes.
Conclusion: The main reasons for the page crash during queries are as follows:
1. The excessive volume of retrieved data caused slowness during the Prometheus service query. After querying the data, it takes time to convert the metric data into a format that the frontend can display, further extending the waiting time for queries.
2. The query results are too large, leading to an extended time for frontend parsing and data loading, excessive memory consumption, and browser crashes.

### Discussion on Problem Solving Approach

Based on the analysis in section III, the goal of solving the problem is to improve the speed of metric queries and reduce the size of query results, which will effectively enhance page loading speed.

**_Introduction of Problematic Metrics:_**
To improve query speed, let's first look at the problematic metric: ""dubboProviderSLA,"" which records the volume of abnormal data in dubbo service server calls. To better understand the meaning of this metric, we need to consider measuring the service quality of a dubbo service not only based on local errors because often, in high load situations, client requests may fail even before reaching the server, or they may reach the server but time out before receiving a response. In such cases, relying solely on the server's metrics is insufficient to reflect the actual problem. Therefore, there's a need for a metric that better measures the availability of dubbo services from the client's perspective. We define this metric as ""dubboProviderSLA.""

_**The characteristics of the metric ""dubboProviderSLA"" are as follows:**_
As an objective measure of the availability of dubbo services from the client's perspective, ""dubboProviderSLA"" naturally requires recording client-related information. This information may include the client application's ID, name, environment, and the instance IP of the client application.


**Root Cause Analysis of the Problem:**
Under normal circumstances, if the server experiences errors in 5 methods, and if the service is a commonly used foundational service with 100 service invocations, each client service having 50 instances, based on Prometheus's label data format, the total data generated would be 25,000 records. However, during major promotional events, the primary factor causing data accumulation is the number of service instances, specifically the client IP. During these peak promotional periods, in order to ensure effective service capabilities under the impact of high external traffic, there is often a need to scale up, frequently resulting in dozens or even more than 100 instances, leading to an exponential increase in data volume.

### Optimization Plan:

**_Optimization Strategy:_**
Based on the analysis mentioned above and after collective discussions within the team, it has been agreed that the primary factor leading to the surge in data is the ""client instance IP"" attribute label. This is the first key element to optimize. However, for a more effective optimization, we have also optimized the way server IPs are handled. By default, we do not group server IPs. This further narrows down the data to a smaller dimension, effectively reducing the total data volume. Finally, for added precaution, we have imposed a maximum limit on the data returned to the frontend, allowing a maximum of 1000 data records to be sent. This helps prevent extreme cases where an excessively large data volume could crash the frontend browser.
_Summarizing the optimization strategy:_
**Optimization 1:** Merge the ""client IP"" dimension, no longer displaying ""client IP"" in the frontend; specific information can be viewed in details.
**Optimization 2:** Merge the ""server IP"" dimension, and by default, do not display server IP addresses. The frontend page will be redesigned, and the backend will provide a server IP list as a selection criterion for querying, allowing a maximum of 10 selections.
**Optimization 3:** For metric queries, perform precise queries through grouped queries, no longer reusing labels for multiple metric queries.
**The previous ""sumBy"" code:** The grouping accommodated multiple metric queries, including HTTP, Dubbo, Apus, Thrift, Redis, DB, and other metrics.

```
private String sumSumOverTimeFunc(String source) {

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append(""sum(sum_over_time("");
    sb.append(source);
    sb.append("")) by (serverIp,job,application,methodName,serviceName,dataSource,sqlMethod,sql,serverEnv,serverZone,containerName,method,clientProjectId,clientProjectName,clientEnv,clientIp) "");
    return sb.toString();
}
```


**The optimized ""sumBy"" code is as follows:** where each metric is precisely grouped by its label using ""sumBy,"" aiming to improve the speed of Prometheus service queries:

```
private String sumSumOverTimeFunc(String source,String metric,String sumBy) {

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append(""sum(sum_over_time("");
    sb.append(source);
    sb.append("")) "");
    if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(sumBy)) {
        sb.append("" by ("").append(sumBy).append( "")"");
    }else {
        switch (metric) {

                break;
            case ""grpcClientError"":

                break;
            case ""thriftServerError"":
                sb.append("" by (serverIp,application,methodName,serviceName,serverEnv,serverZone) "");
                break;
            case ""thriftClientError"":
                sb.append("" by (serverIp,application,methodName,serviceName,serverEnv,serverZone) "");
                break;
            case ""apusServerError"":
                sb.append("" by (serverIp,application,methodName,serviceName,serverEnv,serverZone) "");
                break;
            case ""apusClientError"":
                sb.append("" by (serverIp,application,methodName,serviceName,serverEnv,serverZone) "");
                break;
            case ""oracleError"":
                sb.append("" by (serverIp,application,dataSource,sqlMethod,sql,serverEnv,serverZone) "");
                break;
            case ""elasticsearchClientError"":
                sb.append("" by (serverIp,application,dataSource,sqlMethod,sql,serverEnv,serverZone) "");
                break;

            default:
                sb.append("" by (serverIp,application,methodName,serviceName,dataSource,sqlMethod,sql,serverEnv,serverZone,containerName,method,clientProjectId,clientProjectName,clientEnv) "");
        }
    }
```

**Optimization 4:** Frontend Support for Server IP Filtering
1. First, the backend provides a list of error IPs within the specified time range, allowing the frontend to use them as multi-select query conditions for filtering.
2. For the frontend, when querying ""dubboProviderSLA"" metrics, the server IP field is not loaded by default. After selecting server IP from the list, the results page will display the server IP again. 

**Optimization 5:** Limiting Maximum Data Load

This is a fallback lossy optimization. If after merging clientIp and serverIp, the volume of errors remains enormous, we limit the data sent to the frontend to prevent page crashes. We set a maximum data limit of 1000 records for the frontend, and data beyond 1000 records is not loaded onto the page. The feasibility of this approach is based on the following reasons:
1. Currently, it is estimated that after merging clientIp and serverIp, the normal error range falls within the range of n10 to n100. If it exceeds 1000, it's mainly due to the presence of IPs. Considering the scattering of the same errors on different IPs, having just one IP is sufficient for problem analysis and guidance. Therefore, losing some IP instances is feasible.
2. If, even after removing clientIp and serverIp, the error volume still exceeds 1000, it indicates that the data accumulation of repeated dimensions is in the downstream service dimension, as the service methods on the server side usually won't reach 1000. In this case, it does not affect the guidance value for troubleshooting on the server side.

**Adjustments Involved in this Optimization:**
After optimizing the page, the display of the serverIp dimension is removed by default. When navigating from the alert to the metric page, the frontend needs to accommodate server IP lists, and checkboxes must be selected. Queries are performed based on serverIp selection.

### Optimization Results:
After the optimization, the data loading volume on the page has been significantly reduced. Normal data queries are now completed within 1 second, and even when dealing with larger data volumes, loading typically remains under 3 seconds.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/comments/IC_kwDOKQ9xrM5rIc6v/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Observability systems are primarily divided into metric monitoring, distributed tracing, and logging, collectively referred to as the ""observability trifecta."" In the realm of observability systems, what does metric monitoring provide us?

Firstly, we categorize metrics into two types. The first type is request-based metrics, reflecting specific conditions when an interface processes requests. This includes metrics such as Query Per Second (QPS), response time, the proportion of exceptions and slow calls, and the caller's availability (SLA), among others. These metrics authentically depict the health of a particular interface, and typically, when configuring alerts, these are the most frequently received.

![image](https://github.com/XiaoMi/ozhera/assets/128116675/5c760a3d-8b40-4c80-bcdb-d17842a02af8)

The second type is runtime metrics, revealing the operational status of the service itself. Examples include JVM metrics like heap memory usage and recycling, GC (garbage collection) Stop-the-World (STW) occurrences and durations, CPU, disk, network usage on containers or physical machines, and overall system load. When no obvious error messages are found in the logs or on the path of abnormal requests, it's necessary to examine whether these metrics indicate any anomalies.

![image](https://github.com/XiaoMi/ozhera/assets/128116675/600d05a4-6b17-43f0-8a96-c7d12ceaeb6c)

![image](https://github.com/XiaoMi/ozhera/assets/128116675/59196b5e-f082-4724-b052-ab2ef8e7ded6)


Let's consider a scenario as an example, such as receiving an alert for a timeout in an API call. In response, we can open distributed tracing to examine the specific call details along the path. If anomalies are detected, detailed exception information can be found in the event logs. This approach can resolve over 90% of issues.

![image](https://github.com/XiaoMi/ozhera/assets/128116675/c6596a22-3d67-46c3-addf-2cbd5903db59)

However, sometimes the bottleneck may manifest on the caller's side with extended response times, despite the server-side processing being swift. In such cases, it becomes essential to inspect the runtime conditions of the instances on both sides of the call, examining whether the CPU is saturated, or if GC STW is excessively high, among other factors.

As for the data from distributed tracing, it is currently generated using OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry is a product aimed at establishing observability standards and boasts numerous observable implementations. In Java, it utilizes bytecode enhancement techniques to generate Spans (individual nodes in distributed tracing) at specified positions in the runtime code. For instance, in Dubbo, OpenTelemetry generates a Dubbo filter, creating a Span when a request enters the Dubbo filter. In essence, you can perceive that code to generate Spans is woven into the JVM at startup using bytecode enhancement techniques.

This approach bears significant resemblance to the current architecture of tracing, and they share certain commonalities, indicating that some capabilities of tracing can be reused.

Currently, with the rapid development of AI, OzHera also hopes to explore some avenues in the field of AI. Currently, there are internal teams at Xiaomi working on AI-related products, and we hope to integrate with them to make OzHera smarter. As of now, there have been advancements in AI products in areas such as knowledge bases, agents, and code. Our main consideration is how to empower OzHera with AI while also enriching AI products within OzHera.

Several directions for the intelligentization of OzHera come to mind:

## Answering questions and providing guidance. 
OzHera has accumulated many documents (user manuals, application integration documents, deployment documents, FAQs, etc.), which can be imported into an AI knowledge base and used by agents to answer questions and provide guidance.

## Enhancing the efficiency of OzHera developers. 
In day-to-day development, we can use AI tools' code capabilities to improve efficiency.

## Enriching AI product functionality.

- OzHera has application-related runtime data, which can be provided to AI products via interfaces and integrated into independent application features. For example, application health status, application traffic data, dependency relationships, etc.
- OzHera's code can be transformed into modules within AI products for user selection. For instance, when generating methods in AI, if a button named ""Observable Method"" is selected or checked, then OzHera's `@Trace` annotation could automatically be added to the generated method declaration, and so on.

## Intelligent troubleshooting. 
OzHera actually has rich runtime error diagnostic bases. When an error occurs, we can diagnose it based on these foundations and even make repairs. relation issue #174 ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/309/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I think your suggestion is excellent because the current degradation of trace-etl is not comprehensive enough. Currently, it has the following degradation strategies:

1. In trace-etl-server, filtering can be applied based on spanName and some tags of the span, skipping metric calculations.
2. In trace-etl-es, filtering based on spanName is also possible, skipping tail sampling and subsequent logic, and even not storing the span in the storage system.

Regarding your concerns, I have actually already added some degradation strategies before, including:

1. In trace-etl-server, aggregation of serverIp, sql, and methodName can be performed, making their values ​​become one, with the aim of minimizing the size of the metric data returned by trace-etl-server.
2. Logic for filtering based on application has been added to trace-etl-es.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/comments/IC_kwDOKQ9xrM55rEQX/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently, the log-stream tool is capable of pulling configurations from Nacos, which is a great feature for dynamic configuration management. However, there are scenarios where a push mechanism for configurations would be beneficial, especially when we need to ensure that the latest configurations are actively disseminated to all instances of an application or service.

Proposed Feature:
I propose that we introduce a push mechanism for configurations in log-stream. This would work in tandem with the existing pull mechanism, providing a more robust solution for configuration management. The push mechanism would have the following characteristics:

1.Real-time Updates: Whenever a configuration is updated in Nacos, all subscribed instances would receive the new configuration in real-time.
2.Reliability: The push mechanism should be reliable, ensuring that configuration updates are not lost due to network issues or service restarts.
3.Scalability: It should be able to handle a large number of subscribers without significant performance degradation.
4.Security: The push mechanism should maintain the same level of security as the current pull mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to configuration updates.
Use Cases:

Zero-Downtime Deployments: The push feature would allow for zero-downtime deployments by ensuring all instances receive configuration changes immediately.
Disaster Recovery: In case of a service failure, the push mechanism can help quickly propagate new configurations to restore service.
Configuration Drift Prevention: It can prevent configuration drift by keeping all instances in sync with the latest configurations.
Implementation Considerations:

We should consider the best way to integrate this feature with the current architecture of log-stream without causing significant disruptions.
It may be necessary to update the documentation to include instructions for using the new push feature.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/331/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently, our log query system does not support the use of aliases for searching logs, which is causing issues. When an alias is used instead of the primary key ID, the system is unable to retrieve the correct logs. This is problematic because it assumes that aliases are unique across the entire system, which is not always the case.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Attempt to search for logs using an alias instead of the primary key ID.
Observe that the query returns no results or incorrect results.
Expected Behavior:
2.The system should be able to use aliases as a means to search for logs, understanding that they may not be unique and applying the correct context for the search.

Current Behavior:
The system fails to return any results when an alias is used, assuming it must be unique and global.

Proposal:
We should modify the log query system to allow the use of aliases, with the understanding that the search should be scoped to the relevant context rather than being global. This would make the system more flexible and user-friendly.

Use Cases:

Contextual Searching: Users should be able to search logs within a specific context or system where an alias might be unique, even if it's not globally unique.
Improved User Experience: Allowing aliases would prevent confusion and increase efficiency for users who are accustomed to using them.
Implementation Notes:

The system may need to be updated to handle alias resolution in a contextual manner.
Considerations should be made for potential performance impacts and how to mitigate them.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/333/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently, our logging system lacks a feature that allows users to enable or disable immediate log collection. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where we need to control the log data flow for performance tuning or during specific operational windows.

## Proposed Feature
- Introduce a configuration switch that can be used to toggle the immediate collection of logs.
- The switch should be easily accessible and configurable through the system's settings or configuration files.

## Use Cases
1. Performance optimization during periods of high traffic where immediate log collection might impact system responsiveness.
2. Temporarily disabling log collection for environments where logs are not immediately required, such as during overnight batch processing.

## Implementation Details
- The switch could be implemented as an environment variable, a system property, or a setting in the UI if applicable.
- The system should read this switch at startup and periodically check for changes during runtime to adjust log collection behavior accordingly.

## Benefits
- Provides greater control over log data management.
- Enhances system performance by allowing selective log collection.
- Simplifies operations by providing an easy-to-use toggle for log collection.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/371/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

- As a **developer**, I want to parse JSON logs that contain nested structures so that I can accurately retrieve the data I need.
- As a **system administrator**, I want to configure log parsing rules to ignore fields that are not necessary for the current system or application, thereby reducing processing time and storage space usage.

1. **Add the capability to parse nested fields in JSON logs**, allowing access to nested data based on specified paths.
2. **Provide configuration options** that let users define and exclude fields that are not required for parsing, to optimize performance and resource usage.

## Use Cases

The current `logs-stream` log parsing module lacks some flexible extension points, which limits our ability to control configuration content and the task execution process. To enhance the module's extensibility and adaptability, we propose to add some extension points.

## User Stories
- As a **system administrator**, I want to be able to customize log parsing configurations through extension points to accommodate various log formats and parsing rules.
- As a **developer**, I want to be able to inject custom logic to handle specific log parsing tasks.

## Expected Features
1. Provide configuration extension points that allow users to add or modify parsing configurations.
2. Provide task extension points that allow the insertion of custom logic during the execution of log parsing tasks.
3. Support error handling and logging for configurations and logic added through extension points.

## Implementation Suggestions
- Design a plugin system that allows third-party developers to contribute custom parsers and processors.
- Provide an extension mechanism for APIs or configuration files to integrate custom logic.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/421/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Typically, a correct injection format should be `@Value(""${value}"")`. If it's written as `@Value(""$value"")`, Spring won't interpret this as a placeholder but will assign the string ""$value"" directly to the variable. 

Or am I misunderstanding? Are there scenarios where you actually need to assign the string directly without parsing the placeholder?

Currently, Ozhera is part of the Apache Incubator, and the foundational features are in a relatively advanced development phase. I’d like to initiate a discussion on the development roadmap and key milestones for the `ozhera-intelligence` module.
I plan to leave the existing Ozhera modules as they are while using the `ozhera-intelligence` module to enable intelligent analysis for the Ozhera platform. Ideally, I’d like to decouple the `ozhera-intelligence` module, allowing it to function independently and offer broader support to other projects.


# Goals

The `ozhera-intelligence` module will enable intelligent analysis for the Ozhera platform. The key goals for this module include:
- Allowing users to integrate with commercial AI interfaces like OpenAI, Qianwen, etc., as large-scale model data sources, or deploy their own internal models.
- Developing new interfaces tailored for troubleshooting and analysis within the Ozhera platform, using TraceId as a unique identifier.
- Offering a general interface that supports external troubleshooting and analysis beyond the platform.


# MileStone

I believe the project milestones can be broken down into four key stages:

1. **Basic intelligent troubleshooting and analysis.**  
   When a request or exception triggers an alarm, Ozhera will generate a traceID. All exception nodes and information within this traceID will be sent to the internal intelligence platform for analysis, giving users an initial diagnosis and potential solutions.

2. **Extended intelligent troubleshooting and analysis.**  
   Expanding on the first milestone, we’ll analyze issues not only from a data flow perspective but also by looking at JVM metrics, CPU usage, container load, disk and network IO, TCP connections, and other system resources for a more comprehensive analysis.

3. **Perceptive intelligent troubleshooting and alerting.**  
   We aim to detect dependency issues across applications. When problems occur, we want to not only identify the issue but also understand its impact on other modules. By analyzing the exception chain, we can gauge the extent of the issue and its ripple effect across the system.

4. **Proactive intelligent troubleshooting and remediation.**  
   Building on the previous milestones, we’ll categorize common issues and errors within the platform. With this knowledge, `ozhera-intelligence` will be able to handle issues without disrupting the project, performing automated tasks such as scaling resources or restarting services when needed.
   
   
# Core API and Configuration Changes

1. Add a new configuration option: `OzheraIntelligenceModel`. This is used to define and track the configuration settings for the large model source. `OzheraIntelligenceModel` should include parameters like model address, model name, and a validation token.  
   As we refine the previous three steps, we aim to consolidate common errors and issues into a structured classification system for the platform. To ensure smooth integration of the `ozhera-intelligence` module, the `OzheraIntelligenceModel` configuration must be in place.

2. Implement an API to return model answers.

3. Create an API specifically for troubleshooting internal issues on the Ozhera platform:
    ```JAVA
     public String handleInfo(String traceID){...//TODO}
     ```

5. Introduce a general-purpose query API for model interaction:
     ```JAVA
     public String handleInfo(String loginfo){...//TODO}
     ```

# Compatibility

As the `ozhera-intelligence` module is still under active discussion, backward compatibility isn’t a primary concern at this stage. However, we need to clarify: should we support JDK8? Many existing projects still rely on JDK8, and supporting it would potentially broaden the user base.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/456/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In an Apache incubating project, the basic roles typically include contributor, committer, and PPMC's member, with each role corresponding to an increasing level of responsibility for the project.

We need to establish clear criteria for measuring contributor contributions. What level of involvement is required for someone to become a committer or a PPMC's member?

There are currently two common approaches: 
- The first involves assessing the duration and activity level of open-source contributions, which is the most widely used method; 
- The second creates a quantitative score based on the difficulty of issues, allowing discussions about becoming a committer once a certain score is reached.

I'm uncertain if the second method complies with ASF standards.

Just a example, in this class [ozhera-app/app-server/src/main/java/org/apache/ozhera/app/config/DataSourceConfig.java](https://github.com/apache/ozhera/blob/master/ozhera-app/app-server/src/main/java/org/apache/ozhera/app/config/DataSourceConfig.java),we have a method
```JAVA
    private void setDatasouce(ComboPooledDataSource dataSource) {
        dataSource.setTestConnectionOnCheckin(true);
        dataSource.setTestConnectionOnCheckout(false);
        dataSource.setPreferredTestQuery(""select 1"");
        dataSource.setIdleConnectionTestPeriod(180);
    }
```
maybe we can fix `setDatasouce` to `setDatasource`？
It is a little typo mistake, but for beginners，I think maybe a good chance join the ozhera's contribution.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/comments/IC_kwDOKQ9xrM6Pc3aH/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In the current system implementation, the list of log spaces is managed through caching to improve performance and reduce direct access to the database. However, we have identified an issue: when new log spaces are added or existing ones are deleted, the cache does not update in a timely manner to reflect these changes. This leads to the following problems:

1. The user interface may display an inaccurate list of available log spaces because the cache includes spaces that have been deleted or excludes newly added spaces.
2. Business logic that relies on the latest list of log spaces may produce incorrect results due to the use of outdated cached data.

## Expected Behavior

We expect the system to:

1. Automatically clear or update the cache when a new log space is added, ensuring that all subsequent requests can access the updated list of log spaces.
2. Similarly, automatically clear or update the cache when a log space is deleted, avoiding the retention of information about spaces that have been removed.

## Actual Behavior

Currently, the system does not update the cache promptly after adding or deleting log spaces, resulting in inconsistent data.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ozhera/issues/490/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

    Added comparison logic to detect changes in data within the request.

2. **Data Change Comparison**:
    During the processing of log requests, added logic to compare the data before and after the request.
    If the data remains unchanged throughout the request, the processing flow is terminated immediately, eliminating the need for subsequent operations.

3. **Removal of Lock Usage**:
    Due to the addition of data change comparison logic, which ensures that no write operations are performed when data is unchanged, the previously used lock mechanism to prevent data races has been removed.
