as a follow up on this forum post: https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=rview&goto=1851499#msg_1851499 

I've made an initial attempt to add the Eclipse QuickAccess to Eclipse RAP.
You can view my WIP here: https://github.com/godyo-business-solutions/org.eclipse.rap/tree/features/add_quickaccess_support

What's working (under the hood):
* extension Point mechanism
* most of the default QuickAccess providers

What's not working:
* ViewElement and ViewElementProvider classes  (heavily depending on e4 workbench stuff)
* the UI and the search
  * see QuickAccessContents: on SWT table a listener is registered for SWT.MeasureItem, SWT.PaintItem and SWT.EraseItem which are obviously not available in RAP
  * QuickAccessEntry uses TextLayout which is also not supported in RAP

I'll try to get something running by using the default SWT Table and TableItems, but of course this will look and behave differently, but maybe better than nothing.

Any hint or comments are welcome.

We have integrated the QuickAccess into the demo application. You can open the QuickView windows with Ctrl+3.

In the attached example project, there are four different methods for redirecting. But when called in the filter handler, even the JSON redirect does not work.

Is there some other way to make the redirect work from filter code (because this is needed for openID connect authentication)? 

It would be best if `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()` would work in any circumstance.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/6/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If using a CSP header with RAP it would need to be configured with a CSP `script-src` directive with `self`, `unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`.

Such a configurtion is very permissive and removes most of the security provided by CSP.

[csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/) allows to evaluate how a CSP configuration improves XSS protection and currently rates `scripts-src` values as follows:
- `unsafe-inline` as **High severity**:
  `unsafe-inline` allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers.
- `self` as **Possible medium** severity finding:
  `self` can be problematic if you host JSONP, Angular or user uploaded files.
- `unsafe-eval` as **Possible medium** severity finding:
  `unsafe-eval` allows the execution of code injected into DOM APIs such as `eval()`.


Ideally the script-src tag should not be configured with any of `unsafe-inline`, `self`, or `unsafe-eval`. 
- `unsafe-inline` is required because `org.eclipse.rap.rwt.internal.service.StartupPage` generates a script element with inline code. 
- `self` is required because `org.eclipse.rap.rwt.internal.service.StartupPage` generates a script element with a src from server.
- `unsafe-eval` is required because RAP uses the `eval()` function for several features (Browser widget, client scripting and JavaScriptExecutor, BrowserFunction).

The proposed enhancement is to support configuring `RWTServlet` to generate a ""strict"" CSP header:

When CSP generation is enabled RWTServlet.sendStartupContent would:
- generate a nonce on request
- add a CSP header to the response: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src nonce-<generatedvalue> 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`
- pass the generated nonce to the `StartupPage` so that it can append the nonce to the `<script>` elements.


Additionally:
- `RWTServlet` could be configured to remove `unsafe-eval` from the `src-script`. 
  In such a situation RAP features relying on JavaScript `eval()` would become unusable.
- `RWTServlet` could be configured to add other CSP directives like frame-ancestors","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/12/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The implementation is based on the script `nonce` attribute, whereby only allowed scripts are executed.

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-2726c7f26c'
```

A dynamically generated nonce value will be added at runtime. Use **`'nonce-'`** in your `script-src` directive. Example of CSP:

```
script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-' http: https:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';
```

For a workbench application, the CSP can be set in a new `csp` attribute of the `entrypoint` extension in `plugin.xml`. In other cases, use the new `org.eclipse.rap.rwt.client.WebClient.CSP` property when defining an entrypoint in the `ApplicationConfiguration`.

```java
public class MyApplication implements ApplicationConfiguration {

  public void configure( Application application ) {
    Map properties = new HashMap();
    ...
    properties.put( WebClient.CSP, ""script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-' http: https:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';"" );
    application.addEntryPoint( ""/"", MyApp.class, properties );
  }
}
```

**Note**: Without `'unsafe-eval'` in your CSP `script-src` directive, the following RAP features will not work:

- org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.execute(String)
- org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.evaluate(String)
- org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.evaluate(String, BrowserCallback)
- org.eclipse.swt.browser.BrowserFunction
- org.eclipse.rap.rwt.scripting.ClientListener
- org.eclipse.rap.rwt.client.service.JavaScriptExecutor

- at startup, send a probe containing some constant string to the browser and measure it
- get the result and look into the probe cache, to find if another browser has returned the same result for the current font+style+size
- if so, assume the current client will render **all** strings identical to the previously seen, which implies:
  1. text mesurement requests from the current client can be fullfilled from cached data generated by the previous client
  2. text mesurements performed by the current client can be used by other clients which return the same result for the initial measurement probe

However this approach seems to be fragile:
- the initial probe contains only some (ascii) characters
- special glyph positioning rules (e.g. less spacing under some special conditions) are not detected and lead to ugly work arrounds like the fix for bug 374914
- local conditions of the client which can change **AFTER** the initial probe has been computed can not be detected and poison the cache

consider the following circumstances:
- visually impaired user loads a RAP application, and initial probe returns a match
- the default font used is not suitable for the user, so he uses a browser plugin to change/overrides the font + size to something more readable
- the user now navigates through the application, the rendering he observes is broken by the cached values from other browsers and worse he poisens the cache with the wrong measurements performed by his client.

So as long as the cache does not overflow, **the only way to fix broken rendering for all other clients is to restart the application.**

I admit the above scenario is rather constructed, but in production we have been observing corrupted text measurement caches frequently and can not pinpoint the source. Maybe browsers return different measurements once the zoom level is changed while the application is used. Maybe special characters not contained in the probe cause mismatches. Maybe some users use plugins to overwrite the font chosen during use. We simply don't know and I can't think of ways to find the cause.

My point is the current approach - while worthwhile - seems to be rather fragile. There are so many things that can go wrong and once one thing happens at one client, it has negative effects on all other clients with the same initial probe result (which can be basically everybody in a standardized office environment).

Therefore I would propose an option, which allows to restrict caching of text measurements to session scope. So each client has its own measurement cache, and if something goes wrong only this client's rendering is broken until the next reload - not everbody else' too until the system is restarted.

If this would be of interrest / has a chance to get upstream, I would provide a patch.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/22/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

However it was proposed to make it optional via a switch and leave caching enabled by default, so in case users experience problems, they at least have the ability to turn it off instead of restarting the application regulary.

The reason my proposal is so drastic is that current implementation simply isn't robust  - measure text once and if it matches take for granted the client will render all other texts the same way too requires some luck ;)

The only solution I can think if to make it really solid and keep caching in place  is to re-validate each cached measurement again on the client and re-measure / re-layout in case a mismatch is detected.

Especially we use the SWT.MouseMove event to implement move or drag like features.

While
`control.addListener(SWT.MouseMove, clientListener);`
works fine on desktop browsers (where you have a mouse),
the event will not trigger on mobile devices, since they use touch input.

This is because the `SWT.MouseMove` is mapped to the javascript mousemove event, which only triggers on mouse movements, not on touch movements. 
Javascript offers two alternatives: The touchmove is only triggered when touching and the pointermove is triggered in both cases.

Is it possible to map the `SWT.MouseMove` to js pointermove or alternatively implement an additional event for touchmove in order to have a similar experience on touch and mouse devices?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/24/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

What's not working:
- Now, when I select any date prior to 01/02/1970. No matter if I click on a day or I use the change buttons (by year or by month) at the top, the new date is not accepted and the previous date is kept.

As far as I can see this is solely an JS issue. The following method in the **DateTimeDate.js** is blocking any date with milliseconds prior to 01/01/1970 (in my case 01/02/1970, probably due to a timezone?)

    _onCalendarDateChange : function() {
      if( !this._internalDateChanged ) {
        var milliseconds = this._calendar.getDate().getTime();
        var min = this._minimum ? this._minimum.getTime() : Number.MIN_VALUE;
        var max = this._maximum ? this._maximum.getTime() : Number.MAX_VALUE;
        if( milliseconds >= min && milliseconds <= max ) {
          this._setDate( this._calendar.getDate() );
          this._sendChanges();
        }
      }
    },

I don't see the reason for these checks, can't they just be removed? Like:

    _onCalendarDateChange : function() {
      if( !this._internalDateChanged ) {
        this._setDate( this._calendar.getDate() );
        this._sendChanges();
      }
    },

I tried it locally and it worked quite fine for me.

If there is anything I can provide to help you with this, please let me know.

Edit: For completeness: The problems occurs because ""this._calendar.getDate().getTime();"" returns negative numbers for dates prior to 01/01/1970 00:00:00 according to the unix standard for dates.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/29/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

this method seems to be missing. The JavaDoc and method from SWT:

```
/**
 * Sets the receiver's tool tip text to the argument, which
 * may be null indicating that the default tool tip for the
 * control will be shown. For a menu item that has a default
 * tool tip, setting
 * the tool tip text to an empty string replaces the default,
 * causing no tool tip text to be shown.
 * <p>
 * The mnemonic indicator (character '&amp;') is not displayed in a tool tip.
 * To display a single '&amp;' in the tool tip, the character '&amp;' can be
 * escaped by doubling it in the string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Tooltips are currently not shown for top-level menu items in the
 * {@link Shell#setMenuBar(Menu) shell menubar} on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu Unity desktop.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This operation is a hint and behavior is platform specific, on Windows
 * for CJK-style mnemonics of the form "" (&amp;C)"" at the end of the tooltip text
 * are not shown in tooltip.
 * </p>
 * @param toolTip the new tool tip text (or null)
 *

public void setToolTipText (String toolTip) {
	checkWidget();
	if (toolTip != null && (toolTip.trim().length() == 0 || toolTip.equals (toolTipText))) return;

	this.parent.getShell().setToolTipText (handle, (toolTipText = toolTip));
}
```
In RWT the handle is obviously missing.

Would be nice if that could be implemented. If someone would suggest a fix I could try to make a PR.

Thanks,

After some consideration, we believe that the suppression of the shutdown request belongs to the entry point, i.e. it should be possible to configure it differently for each entry point, as opposed to configuring it at the application level.

Instead I would suggest to start upgrading to 1.4.

Additionally I believe there is no further IP check required for the library dependency upgrade in RAP Runtime. First, there is an already approved CQ 21543 available for another project in the files, second (and more important) according to the project handbook, [ClearlyDefined is a trusted source of license information](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-clearlydefined). By using the [Eclipse Dash License Tool](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-license-tool) I get the following positive result for `maven/mavencentral/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload/1.4` from ClearlyDefined:

```bash

Unfortunately none of the clean versions are available for consumption from Eclipse Orbit, i.e. we need to find a good way to integrate this library in the RAP build process.

I run into a Maven dependency resolution issue related to the version bump of `commons-fileupload` to 1.4.0 in my project. It seems the resulting POM dependency entry of `org.apache.commons.fileupload` looks like this:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>commons-fileupload</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-fileupload</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

It refers to version 1.4.0, but the actual version of the `commons-fileupload` artefact is 1.4 (d'oh!). See: https://search.maven.org/artifact/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload/1.4/jar

Maven treats versions 1.4 and 1.4.0 differently and fails to resolve the correct artefact from Maven central. The workaround is to declare a direct dependency to `commons-fileupload` in version 1.4.

I'm not sure how the `pom.xml` is generated, but it probably takes the information from the bundle dependencies, which afaik requires the use of the 3 part semvers, so there might be a version incompatibility between the bundle and Maven dependency worlds.

NB: I should mention that I'm experiencing this problem in a Gradle build and haven't tested it with a Maven build. However, since the version in the pom does not correspond to the artefact version in Maven central, other Maven builds might run into this issue as well.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/comments/IC_kwDOHNXrGM5LEU0v/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

All bundles in question are just redistributed by us and taken from Platform and from a WebTools (i.e. the Jetty bundles) p2 repository. That and the fact that the Simultaneous Release job didn't report any errors made me believe that there is no immediate need to upgrade Tycho.
With only one day left for building RC2 (and no time to work on it...) it will be challenging to fix that in time.

One other bad thing I noticed, because I wondered why the Jetty bundles aren't causing the same type of problem.  There I notice that someone has jar-signed the contents here:

https://download.eclipse.org/webtools/jetty/10.0.11/repository/plugins/

So now there are two versions of the ""same"" artifact floating around in the mix.  The ones the platform provides are only PGP signed but the ones WTP produces are jar signed; I'm quite sure the jar signed one will not validate against the PGP signature of the one that is not jar signed, so there is a problem just waiting to happen.

If you produce a new build using Tycho 2.7.5 as in the PR, let me know and I'll rerun the test (or just look in the artifact.xml and check that the `pgp.publicKeys` property is present for org.apache.commons.commons-fileupload and org.apache.commons.commons-io.

I think this problem first cropped up from this commit:

I've included an example below. We can always reproduce it with the ScrolledForm of a FormPage.

In this screenshot, all the yellow area is actually handling the scrollbar. I only have a small area at the bottom of the pages where I can switch to one of the other pages.

Info: 
- Tested with Eclipse RAP 3.21 (and 3.19)
- The problem didn't occur before Chrome 105 (we tested it against 104).
- We use the 'business' theme (maybe the problem doesn't occur with the default theme?)


Here an example how we can reproduce the problem with as little code as possible:

**Editor Input**
```
package test;

    @Override

        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public String getToolTipText() {
        return getName();
    }
}
```

**Editor**
```

            addPage(new TestPage(this));
        } catch (PartInitException e) {
            // ignore for this test
        }
    }

    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSaveAsAllowed() {
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Page**

But I found out that calculation was the same in Chrome 104 and there it worked quite fine.

So I prepared a simple Projekt based on the 'RAP Mail Template' using the classes above. It turned out, the key to the problem is that it only occurs when I'm using the **business.css** from **org.eclipse.rap.design.example_3.22.0.20220617-1351.jar**.

After starting the webapp you have to klick on the '+' icon to open the editors with the horizontal scrollbars to reproduce the problem:

Otherwise here the description what I did to the mail template projekt:

The mail template doesn't have the required editor (to reproduce the problem). I've integrated all the classes above in the corresponding packages, extended the plugin.xml by the following:
```
   <extension
         point=""org.eclipse.ui.editors"">
		<editor
			class=""test.TestEditor""
			default=""false""
			id=""test.TestEditor""
			name=""Test (NON-NLS)"">
		</editor>
   </extension>
   <extension
         point=""org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes"">
      <theme
            file=""theme/business.css""
            id=""test.theme""
            name=""Theme (NON-NLS)"">
      </theme>
   </extension>
   <extension
         point=""org.eclipse.rap.ui.branding"">
      <branding
            id=""test.branding""
            themeId=""test.theme""
            title=""test"">
            <additionalHeaders>
				<meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nocache, nosnippet"" />
			</additionalHeaders>
      </branding>
   </extension>
```
Changed the entrypoints definition to use the branding:
```
   <extension
         id=""mailapp.entrypoints""
         point=""org.eclipse.rap.ui.entrypoint"">
      <entrypoint
            applicationId=""Issue_53.mailapp""
            brandingId=""test.branding""
            id=""mailapp.entrypoint""
            path=""/mail"">
      </entrypoint>
   </extension>
```

And you have to add the business.css as well as the required 'img' and 'theme/resources' folders from the mentioned .jar file.

To open the editors I changed the 'OpenViewAction' to open my TestEditor instead of the default one.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/comments/IC_kwDOHNXrGM5KkxdL/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Content Proposal Dialog Reopens if `ENTER` is used for `ContentProposalAdapter`'s KeyStroke in RWT

## Summary

In our solution, we're using a text field paired with a `ContentProposalAdapter`. Then keystroke to activate the `ContentProposalAdapter` is `ENTER`. In our SWT application the process of hitting `ENTER` and selecting a proposal works without any issue. However in RWT, the problem is that once `ENTER` is used to select a proposal, the proposal pop-up opens again.

- RAP version:
  - 3.14.0-SDK-4.17.0
- Browser (issue present in all browsers that I tried):
  - 105.0.1343.27 Edge
  - 105.0.5195.102 Chrome
  - 104.0.2 Firefox

Possibly similar issue: [Bug 445464](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=445464) - ContentProposalAdapter proposals popup stays visible if Combo is used as a control

## Steps to Recreate Issue

Run the attached snippet as an RWT application

1. In the field labeled `""Content Proposal KeyStroke = ENTER""`, hit `ENTER`
1. Select a proposal and hit `ENTER`
	Expected: Content Proposal Dialog _closes_
	Actual: Content Proposal Dialog _reopens_

NOTE: I've also added another field titled ""Content Proposal KeyStroke = HOME"" to demonstrate that this workflow works fine if the Content Proposal keystroke is set to anything else. This would indicate that the issue is around enter being used both by the `ContentProposalAdapter` and selecting items in the proposal pop-up.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/54/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. Create a (SWT.VIRTUAL) TableViewer (new LabelProvider(), ArrayContentProvider.getInstance())
2. Add 100 entries to the table with TableViewer.setInput
3. TableViewer.setSelection to the 4th entry (referring to the original input)
4. The correct entry is selected
5. Now add a filter to the TableViewer so that only the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th entries (referring to the original input) are left
6. TableViewer.setSelection to the 4th entry (referring to the original input)
7. Now: From the resulting 4 rows the second row should be selected, instead the 6th is selected
8. The Problems occurs because Step 5 executes a ""clear"" on all TableItems but this clear keeps the Widget.data field value intact and the original 4th items seems to be recycled for the new 6th item. So when Step 6 searchs for a matching Item it finds the wrong TableItem by comparing the 'new Selection' with the TableItem.getData (method from Widget)

**Here a simple project to reproduce the issue:**
https://we.tl/t-s0uMT7MLpG
> (edit 2022-09-29 @mknauer: Attached referenced ZIP archive as [Issue 57.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/files/9675087/Issue.57.zip) to this issue)

Just open the web app and watch the Console. I've tried to keep the project as simple as possible (no fancy code) and to describe the problem with the comments within the code and in the console output. All the relevant code is in the class **`View`**.

I've _fixed_ the issue by extending the `clear` method on `TableItem` but I don't know if this is a valid fix but would result in other problems:

```
    final void clear() {
        data = null;
        checked = false;
        grayed = false;
        parent.updateScrollBars();
        if ((parent.style & SWT.VIRTUAL) != 0) {
            cached = false;
            setData(null);  // <= added this line
            parent.redraw();
        }
    }
```

We have a RAP application using the Jetty OSGI tools/framework.
When the application is logged-in/started from a browser, it works fine and we are able to execute all the functionalities.
But when we try to hit the application from an external link, it sends the authentication credentials as `POST` parameters for the RAP application. 

The issue is that we are unable to fetch these `POST` parameters. We don't know where exactly these `POST` parameters are getting lost/nullified.

In RAP 1.5 a simple `RWT.getRequest.getParameter(""name"")` worked fine for both `POST` and `GET`, but in new versions it asks us to use `StartupParameters` and using this class we are only able to fetch the `GET` parameters.

Does that mean if we want to start/initiate the RAP application from a 3rd party link, we need to use separate entry-point (like a servlet) and try to get the `POST` parameter and then direct it to `Entrypoint`?

OR

is there any way we can figure out the `POST` parameter before `Entrypoint` pre-requisites are executed?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/58/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You are completely right that if the startup request is POST and the parameters are in the request body, they are lost.

This issue affects the artefact and pom.xml file deployed to Maven Central. It possibly affects other Maven build setups as well, in which the pom.xml information is used to pull in the dependencies.

( I'm repeating my comment from here: https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/41#issuecomment-1259425071 )

I run into a Maven dependency resolution issue related to the version bump of `commons-fileupload` to 1.4.0 in my project. The resulting POM dependency entry of `org.apache.commons.fileupload` looks like this:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>commons-fileupload</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-fileupload</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

It refers to version 1.4.0, but the actual version of the `commons-fileupload` artefact is 1.4. See: https://search.maven.org/artifact/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload/1.4/jar

Maven treats versions 1.4 and 1.4.0 differently and fails to resolve the correct dependency from Maven central. The workaround is to enforce the version of the transitive `commons-fileupload` dependency to 1.4 (e.g. by using a [strict dependency constraint](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_constraints.html)).

I'm not sure how the `pom.xml` is generated, but it probably takes the information from the bundle dependencies, which afaik requires the use of the 3 part semvers. So there might be a version incompatibility between the bundle and Maven dependency worlds.

NB: I should mention that I'm experiencing this problem in a Gradle build and haven't tested it with a Maven build. However, since the version in the pom does not correspond to the artefact version in Maven central, other Maven builds might run into this issue as well.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/63/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I created a _temporary_ fix in

  `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgeclipserap-1091/`

that I would push to Maven Central after a confirmation that it solves your problem as a workaround.

The basic idea is to redeploy the two jar files `org.eclipse.rap.fileupload` and `org.eclipse.rap.filedialog` (because it depends on the first one) with a new Maven version number `3.22.1` and fix the dependency there to the correct `commons-fileupload` version `1.4`. Please note that the jar files are binary identical to their older counterparts, only the dependency in Maven has changed.

With the current publishing procedure the Maven dependency information is maintained separately from the bundle dependencies as defined in the `MANIFEST.MF` which kind of explains why this error happened.

For the next RAP release 3.23 we can see if we can either find a better way of publishing the bundles, or at least fixing the problem in our pom.xml.

I tested the version in the tmp Maven repo and can confirm that this fixes the issue, no need for the workaround of pinning the `commons-fileupload` version anymore.

Checking the `MANIFEST.MF` of `commons-fileupload` shows that the `Bundle-Version` is `1.4.0`, but is otherwise specified as `1.4` in the Maven world. So resolving this dependency from a target platform probably works without problems, but not when resolving it via Maven. This mismatch is unfortunate and probably a legacy versioning issue on the `commons-fileupload` dep, but we can't change that.

I would recommend to fix it in the RAP pom.xml for 3.23 and call it a ""known-issue"" for 3.22 to be done with it ;).

Let me know if I can provide any further help.

Ben

it seems like the exception is coming from the Nebula Grid widget sources. Afaik, the RAP enabled version of the Nebula widget is merely a port from SWT to RWT. My guess would be that the same exception would occur when using the original SWT version of the Nebula Grid. It would therefore be an issue to be filed with the Nebula widget itself. The RAP ported version should not change the original behaviour, even if it may be considered as a bug.

The problem is, if I navigate to the cell, which is not visible, the error occurs. This happens if one uses a listener for pressing a key on the keyboard (in the example a simple print of a key). 

Steps to reproduce the error: 
- navigate to the second column and set focus on one of the cells 
- press right arrow on the keyboard

In SWT everything works as expected, one only gets an error with RAP. 

In addition I have uploaded a new stacktrace

It's essentially a data integration IDE.
We also have a version of that runs on RAP which looks something like this:

It runs off the same user interface source code with minimal exceptions which is pretty cool all by itself.

The main concern in general is that images in toolbars, menu-items and so on have a low resolution which is about half of what we'd expect.  We expect that there's a general setting at play since the resolution set on the canvas is also half of what we'd expect.

The question for this issue then is: where in the code is it decided to half the resolution of the whole user interface and how can we change this behavior?  We'd be happy to test and create a PR if needed.

We're not using any JFace nor Workbench, only pure SWT and we're on 3.22 for RAP.
So yes, this devicePixelRatio issue is probably what we're facing. It's not so bad for the toolbar icons.  For the SVG that we're rending of our pipelines and workflows it's a bit harder on the eyes.  

If we could get the Canvas to not be blurry that would be a fantastic first step.  We're doing our own rendering in a bit of [JavaScript](https://github.com/apache/hop/blob/master/rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/canvas-light.js) on top of Canvas.  We set data on it so it knows what to draw.

If there's a way for us to change the devicePixelRatio in some way at the start of the application?  That would be more than enough.  A quick browser tab refresh would be all that's needed to pick up a ratio in that case. 
Is this something we can set in [CSS](https://github.com/apache/hop/blob/master/rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/light-mode.css)? Thanks in advance for any tips you might have!

There are 2 aspects to this really.
First, the low resolution of the toolbar icons. They really should be sourced from the original SVG images.
That way we don't have to worry about it.
The path I'm taking for that is by creating an exception in the code for the RAP GUI (vs the SWT variant) for toolbar icons.
In this case I'm using a label with MARKUP_ENABLED as sort of custom toolbar item widget.  
I'm uploading the SVG files as resources.
After that I have a facade implementation for the label:

```  
// What's the location of the SVG file?
String src = RWT.getResourceManager().getLocation(imageFile);
label.setData(RWT.MARKUP_ENABLED, Boolean.TRUE);
label.setText(""<img id='svg-label' width='"" + size + ""' height='"" + size + ""' src='"" + src + ""'/>"");
```
The main concern then is to ""disable"" this toolbar icon.  I'm looking at some JavaScript for that.

The second part is the resolution of the canvas areas.  I know about the device/pixel ratio.  What I don't know is how to set it or change it in the RAP CSS file that we have, [for example](https://github.com/apache/hop/blob/master/rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/light-mode.css).

Any help with both topics would be really nice.  It would for example be really nice if we had a way to set the SVG images for enabled/disabled on the ToolbarItem itself:

```
toolbarItem.setData(RWT.SVG_IMAGE, ""somefile.svg"");
toolbarItem.setData(RWT.SVG_DISABLED_IMAGE, ""somefile-disabled.svg"");
```
The image and disabled image would then be the fallback scenario we already have.

Any tips on how to implement this would be welcome. I'd be happy to create the PR.

I agree, such a move would involve a lot of work and coordination with other projects. Thanks for the insights from the Eclipse platform people. It would also be interesting to learn from other Eclipse projects that rely more heavily on the ""legacy EE"" APIs.

Imho, the ""legacy"" Java EE APIs will probably become the new Java 8 ;). They will live on and will be supported for many years to come. In the RAP/RWT context, I see the risk to navigate into a ""dead-end"", or at least be restricted from using it together with Tomcat 10+ and Jetty 11+, thus restricting usage in more and more scenarios in the long-term.

Regarding a compatibility layer that would require no code changes: I'm not an IT lawyer, but I guess that won't be possible due to legal restrictions on using the `javax.servlet` namespace, which was the reason for the change to `jakarta.servet` in the first place ;).

I've tested one tool provided by Apache Tomcat [1, 2] (Apache Tomcat migration tool for Jakarta EE) with the latest RAP release. There are actually minor problems to convert a war file (RAP app) based on javax namespace to jakarta namespace.
I've opened an issues against Equinox [3] and Tomcat [4].
In general, you can use this tool to make RAP application compatible with Jakarta EE 9. The simplest way is to drop the war file not in Tomcat 10 ""webapps"" folder, but in ""webapps-javaee"" and the migration tool will do the job automatically.

I hope that the blocking issue will be fixed soon.

From what I understand, the migration tool takes a fully built artefact (WAR file) and converts it ad-hoc from ""javax."" to ""jakarta."" namespace. At least that will allow to deploy RAP apps on Tomcat 10+ (not taking into considerations any deprecations in the Jakarta EE APIs in the future).

This leaves the ""issue"" that you still have to write the code against the javax APIs. However, since RAP is part of Eclipse, we should probably just wait until the Eclipse platform moves to the jakarta APIs. I cannot imagine that this will take very long, but let's see.

In the meantime, the most pragmatic approach for my use-case (using RWT standalone in a non-osgi environment along with other jakarta-based dependencies) would be to fork the RAP sources and migrate the required bundles to the jakarta API at the source level. That should at least unblock me until the Eclipse platform moves to jakarta.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/comments/IC_kwDOHNXrGM5SLCth/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The migration tool works surprisingly well on Windows (a lengthy error log dealing with jakarta.servlet-api is written to /work/ but it works anyway), but leads to a complete mess on Linux, with classloader issues and version parsing conflicts of all kinds, using Tomcat 10.1.11 and exactly the same app. After several days of frustrating experiments, going down to Equinox and finally, OSGI HttpService, I'm losing my hope we could get it running at all. Some of the comments concerning Jakarta EE on the Equinox project* pointing at the outdated OSGI specifications which obviously dictate javax.*, Servlet API 2.1 and all don't leave me with much hope. My current estimate is that the Eclipse platform will **never** be migrated to Jakarta, even if Eclipse Foundation is the maintainer of that standard. Bummer. Nice job, Oracle, you killed RAP. Or what are the options?

- With our last release [**RAP 3.26**](https://eclipse.dev/rap/downloads/3.26/) in September we tried to achieve Jakarta Servlet 6.0 compatibility by removing deprecated API, returning `null` and empty collections in other cases. However, there is one area for which we have not yet found a solution in [`HttpSessionWrapper`](https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/blob/8779389119c29da298ee616f5989256752eb1e9f/bundles/org.eclipse.rap.rwt.osgi/src/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/osgi/internal/HttpSessionWrapper.java#L64):
  ```java
  @Override
  @Deprecated  
  public HttpSessionContext getSessionContext() ...
  ```
  Our problem: For the currently supported servlet version we have to keep the method like this thanks to `@Override`, on the other hand the `HttpSessionContext` class has been removed in the newer servlet version. We are certainly open to any suggestions and ideas to solve that.
- The Eclipse Platform Team is working on an [upgrade to to Eclipse Jetty 12](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator/issues/1384) for their next release in December. This move allowed us to migrate to the same version, which is what we did with our [RAP M2 milestone](https://eclipse.dev/rap/noteworthy/3.27/?build=M2). This doesn't change the supported servlet version yet, but we hope to have a better chance to migrate in the future.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/comments/IC_kwDOHNXrGM5qYyDd/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Might as well be because of a container bug that has been fixed in the last decade or so.

Otherwise the condition in line 196 would always be false and line 187 would never be called. Likewise, setting the resource root location in the constructor could be done on the context directly. Similar suspicion at line 155. I can see now why this approach enforces the need for the session wrapper. It might be that there were some ""lifecycle issues"" with the underlying ServletContext of some containers such that the attribute map would not accept attributes before some internal initialisations took place. While writing this I had the idea to look at the corresponding test case and tada:

line 256:
  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // START ATTRIBUTE BEHAVIOR TEST
  //
  // Note [fappel]: This fixes a problem with underlying OSGi ServletContext implementations
  //                that do not implement the attributes API part.

So, there has been a reason for using the inner attribute map. But maybe the underlying containers have improved and this approach is obsolete?

This is a regression compared to RAP 3.11, however I am not sure exactly which commit did introduce it.

The issue does not reproduce when creating the grid directly in createContents(), as this causes _onRowRendered to be invoked twice, where the second calls performs the correct computation. However when creating the Grid during an event, _onRowRendered is only called once, in which case the calls to computeAutoHeight() seem return some dummy value (10).

This happens because invoction of the @PersistState annotated methods happens **after** the model file has been written.

From time to time and for no appearant reason clients stop responding to browser-resize events, while everything else continues to work just fine.

Typically when resizing the browser window, the client accumulates changes and periodically pushes those values to the server (setBounds, notifyResize). At first  I had doubts whether this could be an issue with application-code (some resize-listeners missing), but than I noticed even a minimal example with only an empty entrypoint causes those setbounds/notify-messages to be sent over.
For a client in degenerated state however, no network messages are sent to the server on resize - and while other events/etc work just fine, also other events don't cause a resize (so this rules out those resize-messages are just stuck somewhere and don't cause a flush).

I tried to debug the issue further, but now I am a bit stuck:
- in _dispatchEvent (Internal event dispatch method), I see evt._valueType with ""windowresize"", so the browser seems to trigger the event:
<img width=""617"" alt=""window_resize"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14094579/203995163-71ac2395-dc52-4af2-a61f-c95b5fd494eb.png"">

- and later recompute also detects the width changes:
<img width=""274"" alt=""recompute"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14094579/203995309-9d3b212b-c9c4-4299-b479-fdcd4a974cfb.png"">

after which it flushes the GlobalQueues. but no network request is issued by this.


In contrast, on a working client I get additional related events after a browser resize, like the changeWidth event shzown in the screenshot below. This changewidth-event is completly missing in the dysfunctional state:
<img width=""877"" alt=""works"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14094579/203996022-bbe1ea92-b13a-4923-9d6e-d9bf3213b5c7.png"">

I would be really grateful for hints where to debug / search further. The fact that this seems to happen seldom and quite random makes it hard to dig deeper...

Update: I wasn't sure whether this happens only on Firefox, but in a ticket from 2019 I just found the note ""mostly happens when using google chrome"". so the issue doesn't seem to be browser-specific.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/87/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the code you are looking for is in Shell.js.

On a side note, I think that archiving a p2 repository (with its filesystem layout) is better than archiving a zip file: with a p2 repository directory, it can be easily consumed even in the CI. Or is it possible to use directly a zip file in a TP?

Correct, the pull request is not yet merged, and not yet included in the nightly build p2 repository.
But I changed the configuration of our GitHub verification job [rap-head-runtime-github](https://ci.eclipse.org/rap/view/RAP%20main%20branch/job/rap-head-runtime-github/) to archive the p2 repositories like our other jobs, and serve it somewhere below [rap-head-runtime-github/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/org.eclipse.rap/releng/org.eclipse.rap.build/](https://ci.eclipse.org/rap/view/RAP%20main%20branch/job/rap-head-runtime-github/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/org.eclipse.rap/releng/org.eclipse.rap.build/) - just drill down to the `repositoriy` directory.

We have upgraded our RAP version in our WAR file from 2.1 to 3.10 and deployed it on Jboss7. We have observed that:

1. mouse events are not working on table header
2. Combo box multiple character search stopped working . i.e. Instead of entering one character that takes you to the first instance of a word... if you enter two characters... you get the closer match

These features were working fine with RAP 2.1

From RAP community, I get to know that mouse events are NOT triggered in Table/Tree header. This change has been introduced here:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/rap/org.eclipse.rap/+/22050/

Could you please let us know when you are planning to fix this issue. This is a bit urgent as customer go live is blocked.

Here is the code snippets that we have used. It is a high level information and I am hopeful that it will help you to understand the situation.

We have class `HeaderSortListener` that implements `MouseListener`

```java
public class HeaderSortListener implements MouseListener {
    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public void mouseDoubleClick(MouseEvent pE)
    {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public void mouseDown(MouseEvent pE)
    {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public void mouseUp(MouseEvent pE)
    {
// This function has business logic that perform the sort. Ideally this function should get called when table header is clicked.
// Observation : This function was getting called when we were using RAP 2.1. Once we upgraded RAP version to RAP 3.10 , This function is no more called on table header click.
    }
}
```

We have a `initialize()` method in a class from where we are registering header sort listener.

```java
public class CustomMassTable  extends Composite
    implements TraverseListener, DragDetectListener, ModifyListener, IDoubleClickListener, DropTargetListener,
    IFilterListener, IErrorListener, KeyListener, IModifiable, IValidable
{
// Few instance variable and other stuff
private MouseListener headerSortListener;
private Table table;
private CheckboxTableViewer tableViewer;
public CustomMassTable(Composite pParent, int pStyle, boolean pMultiSelection, boolean pCheckLine, boolean headerVisible,
        Class<?> pObjectClass)
    {
        super(pParent, pStyle | SWT.NO_FOCUS);
        // Some initiation 
        initialize(descriptor);

    }

private void initialize(CustomMassTableDescriptor pDescriptor)
    {
// Some processing and layout build
table = new Table(middleComposite, tableStyleFlag);
tableViewer = new CheckboxTableViewer(table);
headerSortListener = new HeaderSortListener(this, sortIndex);
table.addMouseListener(columnSortListener); // This is responsible for registering the mouse event on table header and 
                                                                          //should call mouseup(MouseEvent pE)
}

}
```

Thanks for reply but please do not mark this invalid. These things were working fine 2.1 version RAP , so so ideally they should work with 3.10. Please let me know why it is not working anymore.

We can not go with above logic as that will bring huge changes as sorting logic is quite different and depend on few more parameter. I can not share those details because of confidentiality issue.

It seems that nowadays it's possible to [deploy directly to Maven Central using Tycho](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho:How_to_deploy_to_a_Maven_repository).

Since I only consume the RWT dependencies from Maven Central in my project, I can offer to have a look into how to improve this process, so it could integrate better into the regular release process. In this case it would be nice if you could share some insights in how it is currently done and where it should probably be integrated (e.g. in the [RAP builds](https://ci.eclipse.org/rap/)?).

For testing I do:
- start a RAP application on my pc (windows 10)
- start a virtual machine with ""Oracle VM VirtualBox"" (windows 10)
- from virtual machine open Edge (or Chrome or Firefox) browser and point to host machine
- while application is running and browser is open, disable / enable virtual machine network card
   reply this action many times and each time keep network disabled for few time or long time  
   while the network is disabled try both without doing anything on the browser and by performing activities on the browser    (making the error message appear immediately)

I have done some tests, with PushSession active or not, and watching the error on the browser console I see the error is not always the same, the most commons are: 
net::ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE
net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET

and sometimes also the error above.

To do a better test, I also have increase 'ServerPush.js' retry time to prevent error message box from popping up too soon 
(by the way I think ServerPush should be do a continuos call without break with message if user do nothing while network is down)

Here the modified code in 'ServerPush.js' '_handleError'

      if( this._retryCount < 1000 ) {
		this._retryCount++;  
        var delay = (this._retryCount <= 5) ? 1000 : 3000;
        rwt.client.Timer.once( this.sendServerPushRequest, this, delay );
      } else {

> I was able to fix the above error by setting the lower boundary of the `javax.servlet` import to be at least 4.0.0 in our `org.eclipse.rap.rwt.osgi` bundle. This seems to pass the higher version import to the compiler, and omits the one that doesn't provide the new methods that require implementations/overrides.

Although... 

Eclipse Jetty maintains a good list with their version numbers and the provided/supported API levels: [www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php)

You were testing RAP 3.22 which requires a Servlet level 4.0 that is provided by Eclipse Jetty 10, but you are using a Docker image that includes only a Jetty 9 (probably a Jetty 9.4 which provides Servlet 3.1) in your command line.

In my test runs with the RAP demo applications everything started to work after switching to the `jetty:10-jre17` [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/jetty). Eclipse Jetty version 10 is exactly the version that we are using for our own tests, and what we provide as part of our p2 repositories.

(And please keep in mind that Eclipse Jetty 11 with Servlet 5.0 is a change to the JakartaEE namespace, an incompatible switch of the API, and therefore is not expected to work #73.)

In the releng project [org.eclipse.rap.examples.build](https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/tree/main/releng/org.eclipse.rap.examples.build) you'll find instructions on how to run the build itself. It also contains the pom files for the three demo war projects in subdirectories, and I'd suggest you look into [org.eclipse.rap.examples.build/rapdemo](https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/tree/main/releng/org.eclipse.rap.examples.build/rapdemo).

There you'll find the `pom.xml`, and especially the product definition in `org.eclipse.rap.examples.rapdemo.product` with all the dependencies, and [`assembly.xml`](https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/blob/main/releng/org.eclipse.rap.examples.build/rapdemo/assembly.xml) that explicitly excludes the API bundles when assembling the final war file.

The idea of the Eclipse RAP p2 repositories is that they are self-contained, i.e. https://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/3.22/R-20220906-0913/ is expected to contain everything you'll need (unless we do miss something by accident).

Hello, 
Is it also planned to fully migrate all applications for example : https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/blob/main/bundles/org.eclipse.rap.rwt/src/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/engine/RWTServlet.java  from javax.* to jakarta.* ? 
Is yes, when is it planned ? 
Thanks in advance for your answer

The sequence of events to cause the error is as follows:

1. Use Edge or Chrome
2. The textarea has to be unfocused.
3. Use the mouse wheel to scroll down in order to see the last lines of the text (By this action, the field will not get the input focus)
4. Now try to select a few lines from the now visible portion of text by clicking into the field and selecting some text.

Expected result: The text is correctly selected.

Actual result: 
When you click into the field, the field will scroll to the top of the text before the selection is applied. When the mouse is moved to expand the selection, this will be done based on the position of the mouse cursor in the then scrolled-to-top textarea, which is not what the user expects.
This seems to be due to the default behavior of the Edge/Chrome(?) browser in the textarea.focus() method and the fact that the current selection in the onfucsed textarea will be at position 0.

The issue is also described and was discussed here:
https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1112437/

My idea for a solution would be not execute the inputElement.focus() call in the mouse activation.

Now we have prepared a small sample application to demonstrate the issue.
[ContextMenudDemo.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/files/11041405/ContextMenudDemo.zip)

The idea is that you type some text into the text field, click the right mouse button, which will show a context menu and select the ""Select All"" option there. 
In Chrome and Edge, the selection is applied, but at the same time the text field looses the input focus (unnoticed by the Java servlet). Therefore, the selection is no longer visible. Only by moving the focus back into the field (with anything but the mouse) the fully applied selection can be seen.


In Firefox it works fine.

I hope you can compile the example code.
At this time we haven't found a way to work around this issue. Trying to set or force the focus back to the text widget after applying the selection, does not work. Probably, because neither the Java servlet nor (maybe) the Javascript framework notices this unwanted focus change.

while it's possible to embed SVG images by using custom markup e.g. for a Label (documentation is [here](https://www.eclipse.org/rap/developers-guide/devguide.php?topic=markup.html)) there seems no way to embed SVG images for all kinds of elements defined in the plugin.xml. e.g.:
* Actions
* Commands and Command Images
* (Menus - which contain commands and other contributions)

Actions e.g. are configured with an ImageDescriptor which get's later on transformed into an SWT image and in RAP are referenced e.e. in as div like

`<div style=""position: absolute; opacity: 0.3; background: url(&quot;rwt-resources/generated/a4264674.png&quot;) no-repeat; left: 4px; width: 16px; top: 4px; height: 16px;""></div>
`
This has the problem that it's not working properly on HighDPI displays or when the users uses the browser's zoom function.

What could be a way to use SVG images for this workbench elements?

We thought of a kind of mapping mechanism, which ask a central code part for a replacement of a defined image path+filename which could return a path+filename to a svg instead. 

Or a central place in the platform, somehow similar to the `org.eclipse.jface.resource.FileImageDescriptor.getxName` mechanism. Where there is the problem that everthing is based on pixels ... 

But there may be better ways to solve that

We have found similar demands here:
* https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=561420
* https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/72#issuecomment-1300094443

Thanks for any hints on this.

The fake event is created in `rwt.remote.DNDSupport._dragStartHandler()`:
```js
// fix for bug 296348
rwt.widgets.util.WidgetUtil._fakeMouseEvent( this._currentTargetElement, ""mouseout"" );
```
This creates an instance of `rwt.event.MouseEvent` which actually does not have the method ""getModifierState()"" while the JS MouseEvent does.
So the solution could be to add this method to `rwt.event.MouseEvent`.

The callstack is:

The internal 'selectedCells' member is not updated when the item count is modified. Anyone that now tries to do something with that selected cells will cause exceptions.

In the processing of RAPDragTracker in LightweightSystem of org.eclipse.rap.draw2d/src/org/eclipse/draw2d/LightweightSystem.java, if Canvas is forcibly terminated, processing within RAPDragTracker will loop infinitely.

Cause:
If Canvas is forcibly terminated and display.isDisposed becomes true, there is no timing to exit the while loop.

Code Snippet:

```
while (tracking && !cancelled) {
    if (display != null && !display.isDisposed()) {
        display.syncExec(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {

Proposed Solution:
To avoid an infinite loop, the while loop should be exited if display.isDisposed becomes true.
If display.isDisposed() becomes true, it is possible to avoid an endless loop by exiting the while loop.

if (display != null && !display.isDisposed()) {

You will probably have to use a jboss version that runs on jdk17, but is below jboss 8 due to the change to the Jakarta EE APIs.

RAP was never explicitly made compatible with jdk17, it is just compatible due to the backward compatibility of the jdk itself. You might just need to specify some special jdk startup parameters to bypass the jdk9 module requirements. If you want to be sure then you could go with RAP 3.14, which requires jdk11 (but only due to the Eclipse platform policy). But then, as Ivan mentioned, upgrading to the latest RAP version requires little to no code changes.

What should I replace javax.servlet with?
Should I change it to jakrta.servlet, jakarta.servlet.http?

When I use javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse in my code, such as RWT.getResponse(), I get the error ""The type javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required type org.eclipse.rap.rwt.RWT"" error.

final HttpSession sStore = RWT.getRequest().getSession();

I somehow managed to resolve the above mentioned issue. Now struggling with few more deployment exceptions, first one (probably the parent one) is regarding javax.xml bundle. It seems like org.eclipse.osgi wants javax.xml but I couldn't find its reference in the org.eclipse.osgi-manifest.MF

In general, you need to specify your own launch config for you application. This will include the RAP bundles as well as any special bundles that your app consists of, along with the dependency bundles. This should then also be reflected in your deployment config.

The June release just happened so it could be a good opportunity to consider this again :)

In our RAP application, we have several use cases for editing and checking documents. Servlets intended for this purpose are opened in browser controls (iframes). The documents are typically longer and do not fit on one screen, so they are rendered with scrollbars. If you have several tabs with such iframes and switch from one to another, the previously displayed iframe is hidden with _display:none_.

[A Chromium bug](https://monorail-prod.appspot.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=808072) occurs here, which causes the hidden iframe to lose its scroll position information. Unfortunately, the bug report has been open for a long time and it seems unclear whether this bug will ever be fixed. 

However, [a comment](https://monorail-prod.appspot.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=808072#c3) mentions as a workaround that _visibility:hidden_ could be used instead of _display:none_ so that the scroll position is retained. 

We would therefore like to suggest implementing this workaround in RAP, possibly as an option, so that browser controls behave in the same way in all common browsers regarding scroll positions.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/164/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We've recently switched from RAP 3.25 to RAP 3.27, and noticed, that the ServerPushSession we use gets interrupted after a certain period of inactivity. If the ServerPushSession is not used (i.e., no `Display.syncExec` or `Display.asyncExec` methods are called), the following is shown in the browser's console after some time:

After this message in the console the ServerPushSession doesn't work anymore.

It may last 5 minutes, but also more than 12 minutes until this message appears.

We've investigated this further and found out, that the problem occurs also in RAP 3.25, only that it then lasts 30 minutes or so until the error message above appears.

If the ServerPushSession is used regularly (by calling `Display.syncExec` or `Display.asyncExec`), this problem doesn't occur.

Unfortunately, we don't have a minimal standalone example to reproduce the problem.
I suspect the problem is due to the following commit in the eclipse platform:
https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform/commit/9c3525cbd3fbd1e2618e8c9edf4871f5c8d70cb2

Previously, a NullProgressMonitor was used in the platform if a ProgressProvider returned null.
In RAP, at least in our case, the RAP-specific org.eclipse.rap.ui.internal.progress.JobManagerAdapter is called, which returns null under certain conditions.
At first glance, RAP behaves as before, only the eclipse platform now handles null results differently, which leads to these subsequent errors.

A quick fix could be to add the NullProgressMonitor fallback handling to the RAP specific JobManagerAdapter.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/comments/IC_kwDOHNXrGM55Y8TS/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Users see the following effect: They select a file using the file picker dialog. Then, for a while **nothing** happens, i.e. the progress bar does not change. But since the ""Ok"" button is active, they click on ""Ok"". And then the error is thrown.
After digging into the code I found the asynchronous file upload triggered by `org.eclipse.swt.widgets.FileDialog.handleFileUploadSelection(FileUpload)`.
Apparently, in our environment the background thread does not start for several seconds. But since the ""Ok"" button is disabled from the background thread (`org.eclipse.swt.widgets.FileDialog.SingleThreadExecutor.beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)`), the button stays active and clickable until the thread is finally started. If the user clicks on it, then the whole dialog is disposed. If then the background thread starts, it will cause the ""Widget disposed"" error.
My suggestion is to set `org.eclipse.swt.widgets.FileDialog.okButton` to disabled immediately after creation.
BUT: In order to avoid any ""Widget disposed"" error in this context, the class `org.eclipse.swt.internal.widgets.FileUploadRunnable` must get some information about the disposal of the dialog and then just do nothing.

We have a UI component that we assemble in an RCP application and in a standalone RAP application. User can type in a text field to select a printer, click the + (Add) button to add that printer to the below list. The system then clears the text field and disables the Add button. So the add button has focus when we disable it. There is logic in Control#setEnabled to 'fixFocus' avoid leaving the user in a state where nothing has focus.
In our RCP application, focus is set to the text field. (Left picture in attachment) But in our RAP application it is not. I believe the dialog itself has focus in our RAP application.

It does not happen when deployed on Tomcat 9 on Windows, so maybe jetty. The error is

To reproduce:

```
@Override
  protected void createContents( final Composite shell ) {
    final Browser browser = new Browser( shell, SWT.BORDER );
    browser.setText( createText() );
    
    final Button b = new Button( shell, SWT.PUSH );
    b.setText( ""Set Text"" );
    b.addSelectionListener( new SelectionAdapter() {

    return sb.toString();
  }

However, when I checked the ResourceManagerImpl code I was wondering whether the way resources are registered by the BrowserLCA should be adjusted. Currently, the file name is created as a fix prefix 
""org.eclipse.swt.browser/text"" and then the hashCode of the file content is appended. I assume that this is done to have a unique file name for specific HTML content (although hashCode does not guarantee to be unique for Strings in rare cases)?

In this case I would suggest to check in BrowserLCA#registerHtml if the resource is already registered (via ResourceManager#isRegistered) and not register in this case. I have tested this and it prevents such errors as the one described above and also reduces the number of times the file is written on the server when browser widgets with the same content are created.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/198/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This has been fixed in SWT years ago [1] by comparing the item's control with the selected control before setting it invisible. I have tested this approach with the RWT implementation and it works fine so far:

`// Hide control of previous selection (if any) `
    `  if( oldSelectionIndex >= 0 && oldSelectionIndex < getItemCount() ) {`
          `    Control oldControl = getItem( oldSelectionIndex ).getControl();`

       `   }`

I would suggest to adopt the SWT approach to have the same behavior for SWT and RWT and support usage of shared components.

We do that by calling setPartName on the ViewPart class.

Any ideas?

You can see the text is cut off in the tab even though there should be plenty of space on the side. Refreshing the page or performing Reset Perspective causes the size to be correct.

One thing I noticed is that, on Refresh, the Close button is moved to the right, as if it was initially being drawn with too much right padding.

The font I am using is Montserrat 16pt normal. This is a custom font that is downloaded to the client via `org.eclipse.rap.rwt.client.service.ClientFileLoader.requireCss(String)`. I am defining the font in a custom theme stylesheet:

```css
CTabItem, TabItem {
    color: white;
    font: normal 16px 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    background-color: #1774e5;
    background-image: none;
}
```

The other bugzilla tickets above show similar issues with things being cut off, as if the layout is being calculated too ""early"".

Is there any known workaround for this? I don't want to manually reset the perspective since the user's settings would be gone, and asking the shell to redraw seems to do nothing in RAP.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/204/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When the grid is rendered, this index includes the row header column. So if two checkable columns were created for the grid, they will have _data-cell-index_ 1 and 2.

As a result, the column index used to detect the CheckEditingSupport for the selected column differs by one from the event's index and the CheckEditingSupport of the next checkable column (if one exists) is invoked. Code to reproduce:

```java
final GridTableViewer gv = new GridTableViewer( shell, SWT.BORDER );
    gv.getGrid().setHeaderVisible( true );
   
    for( int i = 0; i < 2; i++ ) {
      final GridViewerColumn gvc = new GridViewerColumn( gv, new GridColumn( gv.getGrid(), SWT.CHECK ) );
      gvc.getColumn().setWidth( 100 );
      gvc.getColumn().setText( ""Col-Index "" + i );
      gvc.setEditingSupport( new CheckEditingSupport( gv ) {

        @Override
        public void setValue( Object element, Object value ) {
          System.out.println( ""Set value to col "" + gvc.getColumn().getText() );
        }
      } );
    }
  
    new GridItem( gv.getGrid(), SWT.NONE );
```
I think that in _GridOperationHandler#handleNotifySelection_ the index should be reduced by the column offset (as it is done in some other places there when columns are detected):

```java
event.index = readIndex( properties ) -  getColumnOffset( grid );
```
This Is used for different selection types (only the checkbox handling seems to use the event's index), but I guess it is correct to adjust the index for all types of selection events here. Otherwise, the handling in _GridViewerColumn#setEditingSupport_ could be adjusted by using the Grid adapter to detect whether a row header column exists.

So I have a simple jakarta.servlet.Filter implementation class called my.app.FilterServlet which just does a sysout:

```
package my.app;

import java.io.IOException;

import jakarta.servlet.Filter;
import jakarta.servlet.FilterChain;
import jakarta.servlet.FilterConfig;
import jakarta.servlet.ServletException;
import jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest;

public class FilterServlet implements Filter {

	public FilterServlet() {
	}

	@Override
	public void init(final FilterConfig arg0) throws ServletException {
	}

	@Override
	public void destroy() {
	}

	@Override
	public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
			throws IOException, ServletException {
		System.out.println(""FilterServlet.doFilter()"");
		chain.doFilter(request, response);
	}

}
```

Further I registered the filter as follows using the new extension carried over from equinox:
```
   	<extension point=""org.eclipse.rap.http.registry.filters"">
    	<filter 
       		alias=""/dummy""
        	class=""my.app.FilterServlet""
        	load-on-startup=""true"">
    	</filter>
	</extension>
```

The application works but the doFilter method of my FilterServlet is not called.
This used to work with RAP 3.24, just with the old name of the extension point (equinox instead of rap).
Am I missing something or did this functionality change somehow?

I checked the documentation and apart from it saying that the class has to implement javax.servlet.Filter (which is obviously incorrect for RAP 4.0/Jakarta EE), I don't see anything that I could do wrong here.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/223/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We are running a RAP UI in a Jetty server. We have found that if the server is stopped, the stop code never finishes if there are UI sessions connected. If there are no UI sessions, the shutdown proceeds as normal.

I believe this is the same as the above bug since I've seen the Framework Stop thread waiting for the UI thread, but the UI thread is also waiting on itself, and there is nobody to notify them.

When it gets blocked in `RWTLifeCycle` we have the following note:
```java
          // In any case: wait for the thread to be terminated by session timeout
          uiThread.switchThread();
```

I'm not really sure which session timeout this is referring to. I've tried setting the timeout in web.xml and even the Jetty server very low (1 minute or so), but it still waits for `uiThread.switchThread()` seemingly forever.

The above bug report also mentions about `UIThread.getLock()`, and we see this note in the code:
```java
  @Override
  public Object getLock() {
    // TODO [rh] use a distinct (final) lock object instead of 'this'
    return this;
  }
```

Would fixing this lock issue also fix this bug?

I haven't been able to find any workarounds, and I'm not very familiar with all of this. I was attempting to reproduce it with the RAP example applications but have been unable to since I always get 404 in the browser.

We are using RAP 3.29 for the record, since we are unable to upgrade to 4.0 since we are using an older version of Jetty. But I don't necessarily see a reason that it should be fixed there.

If there are any workarounds or things I can check to verify that I am doing everything correctly please let me know. Our current workaround on the server-side is to create ANOTHER thread which forcefully interrupts the Jetty shutdown code if it takes too long, but this isn't really desirable.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/241/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

_Please note that the aforementioned code used to work perfectly with older versions of RWT (e.g. 3.4 and older)_

I am most probably missing something here... but I really cannot find what it is.
Any suggestion on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.

Having a DateTime control with style SWT.DATE | SWT.DROP_DOWN and minimum and maximum set, I would expect that a date selected from the drop-down date-picker within the given minimum and maximum range is always reflected by the DateTime#getYear, DateTime#getMonth, and DateTime#getDay accessors.

**Current Behavior**
On a situation as shown in the picture below, the DateTime control is set to the minimum date instead to the selected date and displays a date below the minimum. 

**Steps to reproduce**
1. [Open the RWT Controls Demo and select the DateTime Control ](https://rap.eclipsesource.com/demo/release/controls/#DateTime)
2. Choose the Type Date, the style DROP_DOWN, and add a Selection Listener
3. Set the minimum date to a day just about a week before the end of the last month 
4. Set the maximum a day in the past (not sure if this is actually necessary)
5. Open the drop-down date picker
6. Choose a date from the last month in the allowed range

The drop-down does not close but switches to the last month, the DateTime control shows a date that is below the lower boundary but is actually set to the lower boundary date. The latter can be seen by the selection event message in the picture below. From this point, the date-picker will accept input, but it will not propagate any changes further to the server.

At that time, I assumed its primary and perhaps only use case was within the PDE environment alongside RAP Tools, making its distribution via p2 sufficient.

However, I now understand that you’re building your application with Maven and intend to use this bundle to manage the HTTP service and provide it via Jetty. To address this, I’ve created a `pom.xml` file to upload the bundle to Maven Central, ensuring the dependencies are resolved similarly to p2. A temporary version is now available at:

Thanks for your response.
We are already building our application in RAP v4.1, but during deployment on JBOSS EAP 8.0, we are getting- **""{\""WFLYCTL0080: Failed services\"" => {\""jboss.deployment.unit.\\\""eP_War-3.5.0.war\\\"".undertow-deployment.UndertowDeploymentInfoService\"" => \""Failed to start service
    Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed to link org/eclipse/equinox/servletbridge/BridgeServlet (Module \\\""deployment.eP_War-3.5.0.war\\\"" from Service Module Loader): javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet\""}}""**

Aren't these new bundles mentioned by you supposed to be included with version 4.1, as build of the application is also successful. Please let me know if we need to take some additional steps to include these bundles somewhere else.
Thanks for your help.

We are getting null application context only on the re-login into the RAP application. 
First login works fine, as expected. It is only after the logout (setMaxInactiveInterval(1)), we get null application context and that too only on opening of second editor onwards.

As solution, we tried using invalidate(), instead of setMaxInactiveInterval(), which fixed null application context, but we are getting interruptedException while using invalidate(). Not sure if it is actually invalidating the session, as I can see the session Id in logs.

Any help or idea would be much appreciated.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/issues/260/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When using CSP with script-src 'strict-dynamic' , this causes an error: _Content-Security-Policy: The page’s settings blocked an event handler (script-src-attr) from being executed because it violates the following directive: “script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-62d10451757d440c94d6f1e7f45aefcf'”_

Instead of setting the ondrop attribute, addEventHandler should be used here:
```
//currently: doc.getElement().setAttribute( ""ondrop"", ""event.preventDefault();"" );
doc.getElement().addEventListener( ""ondrop"", function ( event ) {
  event.preventDefault();
});
```
I am not sure if this fix is still necessary at all. The website that has been mentioned as example in the bugzilla does not exist anymore, so I tested it locally and removed this drop listener beforehand. D&D is possible in Firefox, Edge, Chrome and Opera, when the source is a Label. When the source is a Text, D&D is possible in all these browsers, except for Firefox, where the 'not allowed' icon is shown. So it seems to already be prevented somewhere else. Also, when I left the drop listener in, it never got an event when I initiated a drop.

But the need to migrate away from ThreadDeath throughout the stack of some huge legacy SWT application, which may stop itself using System.exit() when not in RAP context, and otherwise eats even Throwables except for ThreadDeath, which applies even to code areas without a dependency on SWT libraries at all, feels to eventually become cumbersome.

So I'd wonder if the discussion to deprecate/remove even ThreadDeath has considered such situations at all.

Anyway, I'm looking forward how a replacement solution could look like - without having an idea by myself, though.
