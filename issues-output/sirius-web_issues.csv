## Current behavior
<!-- Describe how the issue manifests -->

## Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be -->
Users should be able to create a new project which would then be visible in the projects list.

<!-- For bug reports please provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem. -->


## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
<!-- Describe the motivation or the concrete use case -->
The current implementation of the application does not let users create new projects as such users with an empty server do not have a web-based way to move from this empty state.

## Current behavior
<!-- Describe how the issue manifests -->
The current project's metadata do not have enough information to be properly published on NPM.


## Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be -->
The projects metadata should have more information such as:

* description
* license
* issues
* repository

We will have to make sure that we use a proper name for the future. I think using @sirius/core would be a good solution. Since we can't delete anything on NPM, we will thus prepare things for this summer when we will start separating the project in various modules (@sirius/core and @sirius/app for example?). As a result, some APIs of the 0.1.0 release will be broken in the 0.2.0 release due to some refactoring.

## Current behavior
<!-- Describe how the issue manifests -->
Some of our generic components are a bit too dependent on the structure of the application. As an example, the ProjectSummaryCard display a link to a project but said link will always go to the URL ```/projects/:projectName```. We cannot reuse this component in an application where the project URL would be different.

## Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be -->
Our generic components should not depend on the URLs of our application. The current project should be separated in two different packages in this repository with a core package of generic components and an app package with the final application.

The core package may not depend on react-router or it should at least let users define all the links in the generic components. Since lots of links have the same destination, a LinkProvider component could be introduced in order to compute the links in the application. This component would provide the proper links to any component thanks to the React context API. This would let anyone rewrite the links of our components easily.

This API could look like this:
```javascript
const linksDefinition = // To be defined
<LinkProvider links={linksDefinition}>
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
</LinkProvider>
```

```javascript
const SomeComponent = (props) => {
  const { name, linkProvider } = props;
  const projectLinkURL = linkProvider.getLink('PROJECT', name);
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to={projectLinkURL}>{`Go to ${name}`}</Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This should probably occur after the 0.1.0 release.

## Steps to reproduce
<!-- For bug reports please provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem. -->


## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
<!-- Describe the motivation or the concrete use case -->
Our generic components should be reusable in any kind of applications.

## Current behavior

Some components should be moved into their own dedicated folder with specific tests

* WorkflowCard should become stateful and it should contain the current state of the card. It should even be transformed into two kinds of components, a generic one for the card with multiple pages (TabbedCard?) and a workflow specific one (if it is even needed)
* ProjectListCard, ProjectRepresentationsListCard, ProjectSemanticResourcesCard and even ProjectSummaryCard will become more and more complex over time. They need additional tests and they should be moved into their own folders.

As such, part of the solution would be to use something close to the example below. We would have to first declare the layout breakpoints of the application on top of the component tree.

```javascript
import { BreakpointProvider } from '../breakpoints/Breakpoints';
import { DESKTOP, MOBILE, TABLET } from '../breakpoints/BreakpointConstants';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <BreakpointProvider mobile={MOBILE} tablet={TABLET} desktop={DESKTOP}>
      <App />
    </BreakpointProvider>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

And later in the component tree, we would be able to use those breakpoints to define whether or not some components should be rendered:

```javascript
import { TABLET } from '../breakpoints/BreakpointConstants';
import { Hide } from '../breakpoints/Hide';
import { Show } from '../breakpoints/Show';

const Dashboard = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Show aboveOrEqual={TABLET}>
        <LargeCard />
      </Show>
      <Hide above={TABLET}>
        <SmallCard />
      </Hide>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the dashboard would display large cards for a tablet or a desktop and small cards on a mobile. The application would come with a set of predefined breakpoints with at least (mobile, tablet and desktop).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjA0NjYwMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The loading component should be able to let users know that they will have to wait an undefined amount of time. It would be great to have something like this:

```javascript
import { Loading, UNDEFINED_DURATION } from 'Loading';

const loading = <Loading duration={UNDEFINED_DURATION} />;
```

Instead, the loading state should become a concern handled by each component. This concern may not be relevant for every component by the way.

As such once a state container is in a loading state, it should indicate to the appropriate components to switch to a loading state. For that a better solution would to use the following pseudo code:

```javascript
import { LoadingConsumer } from '../loading/Loading';

const TestCard = () => {
  return (
    <LoadingConsumer>
      { isLoading => 
        <Card>
          <Image isLoading={isLoading} />
          <Text isLoading={isLoading} />
        </Card>
      }
    </LoadingConsumer>
  );
};
```

In this example, while the page is loading, both the image and the title of the card will display a placeholder. In such situation, the elements of the user interface will not jump all over the place once the loading is completed. The loading policy of this component will work regardless of where this component is used.

We won't be able to efficiently handle this issue globally, it needs to be become a component specific issue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjA0Mjc3Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

## Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be -->
Text is the only concern which is handle by global CSS classes used pretty much anywhere in the code. Our CSS classes are not an API and they will be modified heavily in the future yet for this very problem we are treating them as such. As a result any refactoring of our text appearance or layout is complicated as seen recently.

We should removed global CSS classes for text and switch to a dedicated component for all text. The API of our text management would thus move from CSS classes to the component of the Text component. A Text component already exists in the Card but it should be removed in favor of a more generic one.

## Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be -->
Using an [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) approach which is implicitly what we are doing with React, there is an issue with the management of spacing. Since our atoms may be reused in very different situations, configuring their spacing cannot be properly done at the atomic level. It needs to be done by the component reusing them, not by them directly.

As such several components such as the Text component in Card need to be updated to remove their spacing policy in favor of a component based one which could be applied to anything. A card with a title and some text would then be changed to become something like this:

```javascript
import { Spacing } from '../spacing/Spacing';
import { MEDIUM, LARGE } from '../spacing/SpacingConstants';

const TestCard = () => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <PrimaryTitle label=""My Title"" />
      <Spacing top={LARGE} left={MEDIUM} bottom={MEDIUM} right={MEDIUM}>
        <Text>Some text...</Text>
      </Spacing>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

The text component here could be reused much more easily since it would not define its spacing policy. We could end up removing the ```layoutDimension``` constants from our CSS.

Sorry for the delay but I was away for a couple of days and since this code is quite new and I'm the one who wrote most of it, the team was waiting for me to return to answer this issue.

From what I understand from your very detailed messages, we may want to bundle the necessary Jetty bundle in our server feature, to simplify the installation. In any case, for the next release we will have [a dedicated product](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/124325/) to launch the server so it will be easier to get started.

Now, your issue seems to be that the front-end cannot find the backend. There are two possibilities, either the server is not running or it does not run on the expected port (or something is very broken). In your Eclipse instance, you can open the Console view and start a new Host OSGi Console.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9y0soEq.png)

Once your OSGi console is running, you will be able to see the state of your Eclipse instance. In this case, you should first see if the server is running with ```ss org.eclipse.sirius.server```. You should see something like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/tLBaJct.png)

If the components org.eclipse.sirius.server and org.eclipse.sirius.server.backend are not active, you may be missing the org.eclipse.sirius.server.ui.autostart component which, as its name implies, starts the server automatically. In any case, you can start the server manually by using ```start <ID>``` with ID being the identifier of the component displayed in the console. In my case, it would be ```start 524``` (see the previous screenshot for the ID of the server component in my Eclipse instance).

If the server is up and running like in my screenshot, then the issue must be coming from the fact that it did not start on the port 8080. While running the Sirius Component code in a development environment, it expect the server to be available on localhost:8080 (just like in the first error message that you have reported). By default, the Sirius server will tell Jetty to use a random port.

In order to tell Sirius to start the server on a specific port, an environment variable can be configured. You can thus launch your Eclipse instance with the following parameter to ensure that the Sirius server will be started on the port 8080 ```-DSIRIUS_SERVER_PORT=8080```.

In order to make sure that all of our environment variable look the same, this environment variable will be modified in the next release to ```-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.server.http.port=8080```.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjY0MjM0OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Could you add the environment variable in your eclipse.ini and could you make sure to have ```-console``` and ```-consoleLog``` too. You should have something like that in the end in your eclipse.ini

```
-startup

--launcher.library

-console
-consoleLog
-vmargs
-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.server.http.port=8080
-DSIRIUS_SERVER_PORT=8080
```

Then start your Eclipse using a terminal and check what appears in the terminal. You should see something like this:

## 🐛 Bug Report
<!-- Check one of the following options with ""x"" -->
* [x] Can you reproduce the problem all the time?
* [x] Are you running the latest version?
* [x] Did you check the documentation?
* [x] Are you reporting this issue to the correct repository?
* [x] Did you perform a search to check if the issue does not exist already?

## Current behavior
<!-- Describe how the issue manifests. -->
The front-end does not work with IE11.

## Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be -->
The project page should work properly with IE11. For that three issues need to be fixed.

* The use of [URLSearchParams](https://caniuse.com/#search=urlsearchparams) is not supported on IE11
* The use of [Array#includes](https://caniuse.com/#search=Array.prototype.includes) is not supported on IE11. It can be replaced by Array#indexOf and a check to ensure that it does not equals -1.
* The CSS does not work with IE11. Support for [Flexbox](https://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox) is buggy and support for [Grid](https://caniuse.com/#search=grid) is not compliant with the CSS specification. The proper solution may be to create a custom CSS with a HTML comment to restrict it to Internet Explorer.

```html
<!--[if IE]>
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""all-ie-only.css"" />
<![endif]-->
```

Those solution will work but in order to maintain the projet over time, the proper solution would involve separating the workflow application from the other parts of the front-end in order to keep the IE11 hacks limited to a specific portion of the codebase.

## Steps to reproduce
<!--
For bug reports please provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem.-
If you have link to a codepen showing the issue or a standalone repo please link that!
-->
Open the front-end in IE11, nothing works.

Modifying the `settings.xml` from the repo as mentionned above would work *if you run the build with `-s path/to/settings.xml`*, but it is dangerous to put your personal token in plain text in a file part of a Git repo, as you are a mistake away to push it to a public repo or PR.

It is safer to only put your token in the default `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` outside of any Git clone, and let Maven use this (no need to use `-s path/to/settings.xml` as `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` is the default).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTMyMDM5Mzg=/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Screenshots

None

### Steps to reproduce

Two meta-models with the same EClass name will produce an icon path conflict :
```
""/Users/jdoe/.m2/repository/sample1/sample1-6.1.0.202006290907.jar!/icons/full/obj16/Relationship.png""
""/Users/jdoe/.m2/repository/sample1/sample2-6.1.0.202006290910.jar!/icons/full/obj16/Relationship.png""
```

### Expected behavior

I propose to introduce a prefix in the resource URL.

The goal of this fix is to discriminate a resource by it jar path.
To avoid to expose the real jar path (private to the project/server), we will hash it.

Example:
`""/Users/jdoe/.m2/repository/sample1/sample1-6.1.0.202006290907.jar!/icons/full/obj16/Relationship.png""`
Will produce a final url 
`http://localhost:8080/api/images/hash/588d4998-b86a-30a6-a9b9-9ffe2ff7d142/icons/full/obj16/Relationship.png""`

### Actual behavior

The actual implementation will produce a final url in conflict (the first jar win)
`""http://localhost:8080/api/images/icons/full/obj16/Relationship.png""`

The hashing strategy : 
The hash is valid only if the hash has been generated by the server (stored in the map first...).
It means that the map is a kind of white list of trust paths.

> The hash should not be easily decrypted too.
You are right. We can use a random strategy or a secure hash algorithm to avoid an easily decrypted exploit.
The random strategy may be annoying for a ""REST"" usage of images URL.
At each server reload... all old image URLs get a 404.

> Having said that, why not hash the whole path to have something like `http://localhost:8080/api/images/HASH.png`?

It's a good idea to give a shorter URL.
The map will be bigger but it sounds reasonable to me.
The hash function will be used more frequently but it sounds also reasonable to me.

It seems to me it would be more consistent that the list of URLs composing the image should go through the stack and the frontend should display those in the same position and order it get it, leading to the browser doing the compositing.

### Expected behavior
Provide a way to unsynchronized a graphical element and it semanticCandidate expression.

An unsynchronized graphical element:
- must be create intentionally with a tool
- can be deleted with a delete tool -> the standard behavior will be to delete the unsynchronized graphical element (the semantic element behind will not be deleted)
- will disappear if it related semantic element does not exist anymore (Refresh behavior)

### Cuttings backs
- Handle only graphical nodes (Edge still 100% synchronized)
- Handle only programmatic contributions (This implementation does not handle yet an unsynchronized node that come from an odesign)

### Potential side effects
- Diagram refresh
- Create node tool
- Delete tool

### Describe alternatives you've considered
We have study an incremental refresh strategy to implement this behavior based on the [React approach](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html).

The current state of this experimentation:
We don't need an incremental refresh to implement an unsynchronized mode.
We can give the previous unsynchronized element thanks to the variableManager without implement a ""React reconciliation"" pattern. 
The render method will clone the previous unsynchronized element and re-render it props (according that the semantic element behind isn't deleted).

This ""React reconciliation"" pattern could be study for a performance issue but it's not this subject here.

We need to provide a drag'n drop tool to drag an item from the explorer to the diagram in order to properly support unsynchronized diagrams.

### Solution

- Handle only programmatic contributions (This implementation will not handle yet a drop tool that come from an odesign)
- Only one drop tool by diagram will be considered
- The ""can apply"" operation will be performed on the front-end side

Provide a magic edge tool. 
A magic edge tool will be available on a graphical element source if at least one edge tool can be created on it.
The target can apply algorithm is a delegation pattern. (At least on edge tool should be valid on this target)

### Expected behavior

We should be able to select several tree/diagram elements.

We can use the CTRL+Click or 🍎 +Click to select several items.
Il a diagram, the CTRL+A should select all elements.

This multi-selection will give :  
- Multi delete
- Multi drag'n drop

### Expected behavior

There is a **_time laps_** between an invoke mutation and the related refresh.
This **_time laps_** involves some strange UX behaviors that we can avoid with a dirty state flag.

Use case:
* T0: A mutation (Label edit/invoke delete tool/invoke node or edge tool) is triggering. There is two ways:
* * T1: the mutation succeed
* * *  T2:  a diagram refresh happens
* * T1': the mutation failed

During these **_time laps_** (T0/T2 or T0/T1'), the diagram is in a dirty state.
We should avoid to propose the contextual palette when the user select a diagram element (especially after an invoke tool)

This proposition is based on a premise: **a mutation in success will always update something and throw a diagram refresh**
This proposition may be invalid if this premise is (or becomes) invalid.

### Expected behavior
According to the following PR feedback
https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/pull/140#discussion_r533488100

We should identify nodes and edges with an UUID (and use an UUID in the graphQL API).

The NodeMappingConverter, the idProvider give a string ```UUID.randomUUID().toString()``` -> we can remove the toString...
The EdgeMappingConverter, the idProvider give a string ```sourceId + "" --> "" + targetId + "" - "" + count``` -> we could transform this string in a UUID ```UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes```.

This implies :
* update graphQL API
  * Use @GraphQLID annotation for nodeIds/edgeIds in IDiagramInput implementations
* use UUID for
  * Node#id
  * NodeDescription#idProvider
  * NodeElementProps
  * Edge#id
  * EdgeDescription#idProvider
  * EdgeElementProps
  * IDiagramService#findNodeById
  * IDiagramService#findEdgeById

We should replace the idProvider type from Function<VariableManager, String> to Function<VariableManager, UUID>.

### Cuttings backs

We should probably do the same job with Label/ToolSection/ITool.
The Label id has a suffix pattern that we should review but it makes sens to cut this work in another issue. (To open before close this issue...) @see EdgeMappingConverter.convert and LabelDescription.LABEL_SUFFIX.

### Potential side effects

* Diagram refresh
* invoke tool / delete","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/156/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For the edges, this is similar to the approach taken in https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/pull/139, which builds a discriminant by concatenating (in a string) all the ids / parameters which uniquely identify an element and then builds the final id using `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes`.

Indeed, in my patch linked above I had not modified the `idProvider` for edges, because the existing logic guarantees it will be stable as long as the `sourceId` and `targetId` are (which the patch ensures). Well, except for the iteration order which determines the `count`. Maybe this part of the edge id discriminant should be replaced with the id of the edge description? The triplet `sourceId`, `targetId` and `descriptionId` should be both unique and stable, and this would unify the handling of all ids.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTg5MDI1MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. Open a project and select a semantic element with several properties in the explorer.
2. Open the browser's dev tools on the _Network_ tab.
3. Click on one of the widgets in the properties view.
4. In the _Network_ tab find the `graphql` request which sent the `operationName: ""updateWidgetFocus""`
5. The _Response_ for this request is always:

```json

  ""data"": {
    ""updateWidgetFocus"": {
      ""__typename"": ""ErrorPayload"",
      ""message"": ""An unexpected error has occurred, please contact the server administrator""

  }
}
```

## Analysis

When receiving a `UpdateWidgetFocusInput`, `MutationUpdateWidgetFocusDataFetcher` dispatches the event to `IProjectEventProcessorRegistry`. It ends up being treated by `FormEventProcessor.handle(IRepresentationInput, Context)`, which delegates to the supplied `IWidgetSubscriptionManager`, but the subscription updates are sent asynchrnously, and `FormEventProcessor.handle` does not return any value in this case. The default `Optional.empty()` is interpreted by `MutationUpdateWidgetFocusDataFetcher` as an error, so it returns an unexpected error payload.

### Expected behavior

There are still quite a lot of places where the code uses the following code pattern to get the value of a single variable:
```java
Object xxx variableManager.getVariables().get(""xxx"");
```

The problem is that `getVariables()` will recursively build a `Map` with all the accessible variables, and then we use that map to do a single `get` on it and drop it. That's a lot of work and allocations for a single variable lookup.

The `getVariables` method can be useful to get a complete snapshot of all the available variables in some case, e.g.:
* if we know we will look at several variables in it;
* most commonly, because we need to pass the complete `Map<String, Object>` to `AQLInterpreter.evaluateExpression(Map<String, Object>, String)`

In all other cases, for a single variable lookup the `VariableManager.get(String, Class<T>)` should be prefered as it is strictly more efficient for single lookups: it stops iterating as soon as the requested variable is found and does no allocation.

### Cuttings backs

Some uses of the pattern, in particular in tests, are probabaly fine, but I think it would be better to use the more efficient API everywhere except in specific cases so that it becomes the ""natural"" choice.

Maybe we should rename `getVariables` to something else to make it clear that it actually does quite a lot of work and is probably not the first choice when you need to lookup a single value. `getAllVariablesSnapshot()` or something like that?

### Potential side effects

Improved performance. Maybe not measurable in all cases, but from earlier measures, the deep map copies performed by `getVariables` was visible in some parts of the refresh.
I don't see any cases for negative side effects or risks.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a Sirius Web app using a VSM which defines one or more sequence diagrams (which are not supported).

### Expected behavior

The sequence diagrams definitions should be ignored, and not available to the end user as possible diagrams to create.

### Actual behavior

Sequence diagrams are made available, and converted using the rules for normal diagrams (which make no sense for them). When instanciated, the result is completely broken.

### Expected behavior

Sirius Desktop supports the `eInverse()` AQL service in its intepreted expressions to navigate ""backwards"" on EMF references in the semantic model. This feature is used in a lot of existing VSMs, but we do not support it as it requires setting up AQL properly for that.

### Cuttings backs

* Make the feature configurable (see below).
* Make the feature lazy (see below).

### Potential side effects

The addition of an `ECrossReferenceAdapter` increases the memory footprint. If that is an issue, maybe this should be configurable (or the adapter installed lazyly on the first invocation of `eInverse` in a given project).

### Describe alternatives you've considered

* Use one of the `EcoreUtil.UsageCrossReferencer.findAll()` on every call to `CrossReferenceProvider#getInverseReferences`. This would avoid the memory overhead, but replace it with a *very* costly operation on every invocation (rebuild a full `UsageCrossReferencer` each time).

This kind of thing is already possible using the existing mechanisms.

A concrete Sirius Web application is built on Spring Boot, which has its own extensibility mechanisms built-in.

To add something like Acceleo support you would need to:
* implement the actual generation service in a new module for the backend, see for example all the existing ones at https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/tree/master/backend. Acceleo is available as Maven artifacts on https://repo.eclipse.org.
* add an API entry point (either REST or GraqhQL) to your backend so that the frontend can call this new service. If you chose a REST endpoint, you can use the normal Spring Boot APIs to register a new controller. If you chose GraphQL, see `org.eclipse.sirius.web.graphql.utils.schema.ITypeCustomizer` and `org.eclipse.sirius.web.graphql.utils.schema.ITypeProvider` for how to extend the Sirius Web GraphQL Schema with your own types and additional fields.
* modify the frontend code to add the required UI elements to trigger the backend service. At the moment the only way to do this is to fork the `sirius-components/frontend` code.

- [ ] Make it possible to create and edit model instances of this DSL in the explorer and properties view. The MVP will use Ecore as an implementation, and simply expose a limited subset of it, with different names, in the UI.
- [ ] Add a simple ""Ecore Tools""-like diagram to edit these elements.

When you download a *project*, you should get a zip archive with all the current contents of the project (models and diagrams).
Uploading expects such an archive as input, and will create a new project with the same state as what was stored in the archive.

You can also download & upload individual models, but it's a different mechanism. ""Upload project"" expects a full project archive, not an individual file.

Most of the architecture actually has very little adherence to EMF, but there are still a few places which either assume it or are simply not flexible enough to allow for alternate implementations to be provided.

This ticket is about removing these limitations.

Note that that we do not simply want projects/editing contexts which use non-EMF documents/models, but support documents of different kinds inside the same project/editing context (though without interdependencies between them, at least as far as the framework is concerned).

The first usage, which will drive this work, is the definition of studios, and in particular diagram definitions.

1. isolate the current dependency towards EMF in `DocumentService` and related and move the generic implementations into `sirius-web-services`;
2. add a notion of ""type"" to `Document` (probably a simple string). Type-specific implementations are delegated to some handler (`IEditingContext[PersistenceService]` maybe?)
3. add support for mixing multiple types of documents inside a single project or editing context.

The `IDocumentService` interface currently has only a single implementation, `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.services.DocumentService`.
In practice, the only way this really depends  on EMF is in the `getBytes()` method, which is only used in two places:
- `org.eclipse.sirius.web.spring.controllers.DocumentController`: REST endpoint to download the content of a document.
- `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.services.ProjectExportService`: produce a zip archive with the whole content of a projet.

_Side note_: `getBytes()` seems to do unneeded work when asked for a JSON version of the document. I'll open a separate ticket with a fix for that.

The `getBytes()` method should be removed from `IDocumentService`.
It could be moved to `IEditingContext`, at least in a first step.
Or maybe `IEditingContextPersistenceService`?
Or some other abstraction that emerges after a few steps.
I'll go with `IEditingContext` in the first patches to move forward, but this may change afterwards.

After this step, `DocumentService` (and `DocumentMapper`) can be moved to `sirius-web-services`.

_Next_: `CreateDocumentEventHandler`, `DeleteDocumentEventHandler`, `RenameDocumentEventHandler` and `UploadDocumentEventHandler` also have limited adherence to EMF, so it should be extracted in a similar way, and the now generic implementations moved to `sirius-web-services`. More details later.

* gets the document's `content` which is already in JSON to create an EMF model

This is completely useless in this case, and we can simply return the document's `content` as is.

This method is used in `ProjectExportService` to produce the project archive with all models/documents as JSON files.

In my tests, on a simple projet with just ""Big Guy"" (17k semantic elements), the shortcut reduces the project export time from about 1500ms to about 360ms, with not difference in the resulting zip file.

From the look of the stack, it seems there are actually two separate issues:
* `Edge.toString()` assumes all its labels are non-null, but the `Edge.Builder` does not guarantee this. Probably voluntarily as the normal pattern used for the other fields is correctly followed (`Objects.requireNonNull()`).
* The reason `Edge.toString()` is invoked at all is to create an error message for an exception indicating a duplicate key (`Collectors.duplicateKeyException`). In `EdgeRequestor`, the call to `Collectors.toMap(Edge::getTargetObjectId, Function.identity())` assumes all edges have disting `targetObjectId`, which is wrong.

I'll open two separate issues in eclipse-sirius/sirius-components for these, and report here when they are fixed.

Our APIs require the use of builders (which is fine) and the builders' `build()` methods enforce the fact that all the parameters are non-null (which by itself is fine too).
However, as is this means one has to write things like:

```java
var styleDescription = LabelStyleDescription.newLabelStyleDescription()
                                            .colorProvider(variableManager -> ""#051e37"")
                                            .fontSizeProvider(variableManager -> 16)
                                            .boldProvider(variableManager -> false)
                                            .italicProvider(variableManager -> false)
                                            .underlineProvider(variableManager -> false)
                                            .strikeThroughProvider(variableManager -> false)
                                            .iconURLProvider(variableManager -> """")
                                            .build();
```

I shouldn't have to explicitly specify that I do not want may label to be ""strike through"" at the risk of getting an NPE if I forget this attribute I do not care about.

Most attributes here should have some sensible defaults so that I only need to override the attributes I care about:

```java
var styleDescription = LabelStyleDescription.newLabelStyleDescription()
                                            .colorProvider(variableManager -> ""#051e37"")
                                            .fontSizeProvider(variableManager -> 16)
                                            .build();
```

Note that this is not just a convenience. Using the current rules, as soon as we add some new attribute, say the font name here, all existing code, including in already defined and deployed modelers, becomes broken and will throw an NPE because they have not specified an explicit value for an attribute which did not even exist when they were written.

If we really want to leave the existing `LabelStyleDescription.newLabelStyleDescription()` (I don't really see why leave this ""trap"" to users of the API), the defaults could be limited to a new method:

```java
public static Builder newLabelStyleDescriptionWithDefaults() {
    return new Builder().colorProvider(variableManager -> ""#6A6C6E"")
                        .fontSizeProvider(variableManager -> 14)
                        .boldProvider(variableManager -> false)
                        .italicProvider(variableManager -> false)
                        .underlineProvider(variableManager -> false)
                        .strikeThroughProvider(variableManager -> false)
                        .iconURLProvider(variableManager -> """");
}
```


_Optional_: when it makes sense, some builder methods could be overloaded with variants or alternative methods without the `Provider` suffix which take a constant so that I don't have to write a lambda:

```java
var styleDescription = LabelStyleDescription.newLabelStyleDescription()
                                            .colorProvider(""#051e37"")
                                            .fontSizeProvider(16)
                                            .build();
```

or shorter and more exact (as the constants are not ""providers"" anymore):

```java
var styleDescription = LabelStyleDescription.newLabelStyleDescription().color(""#051e37"").fontSize(16).build();
```

```java

public class LabelDescription {
    public static final LabelStyleDescription DEFAULTS = LabelStyleDescription.newLabelStyleDescription()

      .build();
    public static LabelStyleDescription newLabelStyleDescription(LabelStyleDescription prototype) {

                // etc.
            ;
    }
}
```

1. expose a `DEFAULTS` object that can be used directly;
2. provide a way to initialize a new object using the properties of an existing one, which could be `DEFAULTS` or any other, and still allow for customization/overriding of selected properties.

This is not theoretical: this happened at least once when we added support for direct edit on edges. The `ViewConverter` code was not updated, eveything compiled but any attempt to create an edge description in a dynamic studio caused an NPE.

However `currentTimeMillis` is designed to return the precise ""wall time"". For computing timing differences, [`System.nanoTime()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime()) should be prefered, as it is designed specifically for this and is (at least potentially) more precise and more efficient ([except maybe on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19052316/why-is-system-nanotime-way-slower-in-performance-than-system-currenttimemill/19052440)).

For example `EStringIfDescriptionProvider` will only match `EAttributes` which are exactly typed `EString`, but ignore the ones which use a custom `EDataType` which maps (like `EString`) onto `java.lang.String`.

As an example, trying to display properties views on a Sirius Desktop VSM does not show all the intepreted expressions, as those are typed with the `InterpretedExpression [java.lang.String]` data type defined in `viewpoint.ecore`.

The same is true for booleans (the test `eAttribute.getEType().equals(EcorePackage.Literals.EBOOLEAN)` is too strict), and in `NumberIfDescriptionProvider`, where `eAttribute.getEType().equals(this.eDataType)` should also consider the case where `eAttribute.getEType().getInstanceClassName().equals(this.eDataType.getInstanceClassName())`.

1. In your odesign file, specify a conditional style for a container or node mapping (e.g. 'MyMapping').
2. Set a specific label expression in the conditional style

### Expected behavior
In Sirius-Web representations displayed to users, the label of elements with mapping 'MyMapping' should be the one of the conditional style.

### Steps to reproduce

When selecting some elements in the explorer, the rendering of the properties view can produce error messages from Material UI.

In the screenshot above, we can see that one of the ""Select"" widgets has 4 possible values (options) with non-null ids. They all appear correctly in the UI, with the special one ""None"" added by the code:
```js
          <MenuItem value="""">
            <em>None</em>
          </MenuItem>
```
All the options, including the ""None"" one have a non-null value, but still Material complains that we provdided a 'null' value somewhere....

Currently the only way to add support for a new business domain is to define it using a ""classical"" EMF-based metamodel, generated from the Eclipse-based EMF tooling. Once you have it, you need to register the corresponding EMF `EPackage` and `AdapterFactory`, as you correctly guessed.

Then to create an actual modeler to edit instances of this domain you could define your own diagram definition in plain Java, but the current APIs we offer are rather low-level so this is the ""hard core mode"". The easiest way for now is to use Sirius Desktop to create the modeler definition. It will produce a `.odesign` file which, in most simple cases, is a self-contained definition of your diagram. This is the file you then need to reference in the configuration above.

In short, for the time being to create your own modeler on your own custom domain the easiest way it to get a working version on Sirius Desktop (using the tooling available in Obeo Designer CE for example) and then to plug that in Sirius Web. https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/Flow-Designer/, which we use in the sample Sirius Web application is a good example of that. It existed before, was made with/for Sirius Desktop, but with minimal adaptations it can be used inside Sirius Web.

If you are completely new to the Eclipse/EMF world, we have tutorials [here](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Sirius/Tutorials) which start from scratch with [the definition of the domain model](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Sirius/Tutorials/DomainModelTutorial) up to the build and distribution of a Sirius Desktop-based modeler (which you can then use in Sirius Web like the sample application uses the Flow modeler).

We hope to streamline all of these steps in the near future, the end goal being to be able to create and use your own modeler from scratch without leaving your browser, so stay tuned!

I do have one question that I can't figure out, though. It's not strictly related to sirus-web, but I don't know where else to ask. Since it's not strictly related to sirius-web, I don't want to open a new issue to avoid polluting the issue tracker.

I can't get imports to be resolved correctly in Java files inside model packages when using VSCode or Neovim (both use https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls under the hood).

Looks like VSCode can handle a bit better, as it resolves imports from other model packages and only fails to resolve external ones (from `org.eclipse`). Neovim fails to resolve either of those.

They are resolved fine and everything seems to be working when opening those files with Obeo Designer.

There are also no errors when packaging those modules with Maven (with Tycho).

There are (almost) no problems with imports when opening regular projects, e.g. `sirius-web-sample-application` from this repository:

VSCode fares well

Neovim has some problems, but works for the most part

</details>


So, looks like the problems are only when opening model projects (`eclipse-plugin` `packaging` in `pom.xml`)

The problem occurs both in the model that I have created (https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/tree/main/packages/model) as well as when I opened https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/Flow-Designer with Neovim or VSCode.

I found very little information online about this exact case. I have tried various Tycho settings, removing `.classpath` files, adding `dependency` in `pom.xml`s between packages, none of it worked.

How do I get https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls to correctly resolve imports and dependencies in Java files inside model packages? If you're working in VSCode and have only VSCode-related tips, that works too.

The projects in Flow-Designer are not plain/classical Java projects, but Eclipse Plug-in Projects. 

Tycho and Obeo Designer know about this kind of projects and know where to look for their dependencies and how to resolve them to build a build-path/classpath: the dependencies are declared in the OSGi `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`, and will be resolved from the Target Platform definition which refers to p2 repositories where to find the OSGi bundles (JARs) required.

VS Code, NeoVim or any other IDE which is not aware of this type of project will not find the dependencies. If it knows about Maven it will look inside the `pom.xml` files, but the dependencies are not declared there.

I don't think any non Eclipse-based IDE knows how to deal with the specifics of Eclipse Plug-in Projects (VS Code uses `eclipse.jdt.ls` which indeed comes from Eclipse, but is a lower-level component and does not know about these).

[Spring Tool Suite for Eclipse](https://spring.io/tools) is based on Eclipse, and provided you install the Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Developement Environment, not sure if it's installed by default) you can have a single IDE which can deal with both plain Maven projects (through M2E) and Eclipse Plug-ins (through PDE).

Otherwise you'll need to explicitly declare the project dependencies in the `pom.xml`, this needs finding Maven repos where they are available (which is not always easy, as projects from the Eclipse world tend to publish to p2 repos only).

EMF itself is available in Maven Central, and https://repo.eclipse.org/ contains others. In particular the Sirius Desktop JARs that Sirius Web depends on are obtained from there. See https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/master/backend/sirius-web-compatibility/pom.xml#L43 and the dependencies starting at https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/master/backend/sirius-web-compatibility/pom.xml#L143.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create an EMF-based document from a metamodel which has multi-valued attibutes.
2. Select an element with such an attribute in the exporer.
3. In the element's properties view, the multi-valued attribute is represented by a radio group (i.e. a single value is expected), with no elment checked. Trying to enable one of the values causes a `ClassCastException` on the backend when we call `eObject.eSet(attribute, value)` with `value` not being a `Collection` as expected.

Using the sample Sirius Desktop VSM support in https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/pull/38, this can be reproduced by selecting a node style element as shown in the screenshot above. In this case the exception is thrown in `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.compatibility.properties.EEnumIfDescriptionProvider.getNewValueHandler()`

### Expected behavior

For this kind of attribute (at least for EEnum-based ones), we should render a group of checkboxes and support checking/unckecking each one individually.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/326/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

And a third time when the input field loses the focus (which is expected since focus lost triggers the rename).

Note that renaming documents of semantic objects from the explorer work fine. `EditingContextEventProcessor.doHandle(IInput)` has some special code for `RenameRepresentationInput`, which trigger the publication of an event. This may be related to the issue as this is specific to representation renaming.

The idea is to ass two new variables, which would be defined in every relevant context (in particular in tools, but also during the edge rendering when evaluating expressions for a single edge instance):
* `semanticEdgeSource`: the semantic element at the source/origin of the edge instance;

### Expected behavior
Label should have UUID type ID as Node and Edge for instance.

...

### Cuttings backs

### Potential side effects
Currently, the label ID is based on the string returned by the idProvider from the labelDescription. We should compute a stable ID in the same way as for Edge or Node. That implies removing the idProvider from labelDescription and compute the stable id in LabelComponent.

In the screenshot below, on the right I have Sirius Desktop in which I created a very simple Ecore-based ""modeler"" which displays super-classes relations between EClasses, and a simple Edge Creation tool which creates such a new relation.

On the left I have the exact same `odesign` file deployed in Sirius Web, and the after uploading the `sample.ecore` I used in Sirius Desktop, I see the same relations correctly displayed. In both cases the edge creation tool correctly creates a new edge.

One possible explanation is that your issue is not related to the relation-based edges themselves, but maybe some operation that you use in the *implementation* of the edge creation tool which is not supportedn or has a slightly different behavior in Sirius Web. In my case the tool simply changes context to the `source` element and then uses the `Set` model operation to add the `target` value (the semantic element at the end of the new edge) into the source's `eSuperTypes` reference.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTMyMjExODE=/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I think I didn't clarify my issue enough, the relation based edge works fine. I think the advanced section in edge creation tool is not supported currently.

In Sirius-Desktop I'm using `Extra source mapping` and `Extra target mapping` along with `if conditions` to allow users to click first on A and then connect it to B or they can **click first on B** and then connect it to A and in both cases the same relation(A--->B) will be created.

The problem is on Sirius-web, the edge connection symbol shows up for A and I can establish a relational edge but it doesn't show up for B.

The error occurs because for discovering dynamically contributed domains and views, at several points in the code we try and load *all* documents in the database as EMF models:
* `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.view.DynamicRepresentationDescriptionService.findDynamicRepresentationDescriptions(UUID)`
* `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.services.EditingContextSearchService.findById(UUID)`
* `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.services.EditingContextEPackageService.getEPackages(UUID)`

For most documents which are instances of statically known metamodels (including views and domain *definitions*), this is fine.
For documents which are *instances* of dynamically contributed domains, EMF JSON does not (and can not) know about the corresponding metamodel/`EPackage`, so it tries to resolve the declared nsURI, but in this case the nsURI is an UUID and fails to parse as a URI.
The problem is not the ""shape"" of the nsURI though, even if we used a syntactically correct nsURI, it can simply not be resolved at this point as the EMF EPackage is not known in this context.

### Proposed fix

Following @sbegaudeau's suggestion, we will add a finer grained query on `DocumentRepository`. In the locations mentioned above we are only actually interested in either domain or view definitions, so we can restrict our search and avoid trying to load problematic documents. This will also improve performance.

PostgreSQL provides the required features to find the JSON documents which are instances of specific metamodels we are interested in. For example to select (and load) only domain definitions:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document document
WHERE document.content::jsonb @> '{ ""ns"": { ""domain"": ""http://www.eclipse.org/sirius-web/domain"" } }'::jsonb

1. Make sure you have registered the domain & view metamodels.

5. Go back to the project list and create a separate project, say ""instance""
6. In it, create a new empty document. Creating an ""Empty Flow"" and removing the top-level System afterwards is OK too.
7. On the new document do ""New Object"", and in the ""Create a new root object"" dialog, select the domain created at step 4 above in ""studio"", and chose any of its entity type.

Our business concerns are too tightly integrated with some of our code sued to support the edition of representations in a collaborative environment and our newly introduced meta-modeling support.

### Solution

We will tighten the scope of Sirius Components and as a result some code currently in the repository will become out of the scope of Sirius Components. This code will thus move from this repository to the Sirius Web one.

The Sirius Components repository will be more focused on the workbench, its representations (diagrams, forms, trees), meta-modeling support and some core components (backend or frontend) while Sirius Web will still be a complete application showing how Sirius Components can be used. Since some of our users have very different requirements for their applications, we need to have a more visible separation between the core parts of the framework and our sample application.

Some unnecessary parts will be removed in our business layer and, by migrating this code in Sirius Web, it will way easier for our users to fork our business code to do anything they want instead of waiting for us to create a new specific entry point for their needs.

### Rabbit holes

* Do not move the code out of the Sirius Components repository unless the task is almost finished to deal with reeling issues only at the end.

### Screenshots

![2021-03-24_11-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10608/112291470-6efa2a80-8c90-11eb-99bf-7b0d3851dde4.png)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new diagam (e.g. a Topography in the sample Robot Flow model).
2. Scroll/span to display all the contents of the diagram in the center of the screen.
3. Select the most ""top-left"" element and move it upper and more to the left. At this point everything is still visible on the screen.
4. Close and reopen the diagram: the element moved in the previous step is cropped or even invisible.

### Expected behavior

When opening a diagram, either we should remember the previous zoom/scroll settings (but in a multi-user env I'm not sure it's a good approach, or we'd need user-specific properties for these like GMF, and it's another can of worms), or more realistically adjust the viewport to ensure the top-left part of the diagram is visible.

Currently we have no way for the user to see the position of the elements relative to the (0, 0) origin, so the beahvior is confusing.

Another approach would be to normalize the coordinates server-side after a refresh/layout, so that all the diagram elements are always in the lower-right quadrant of the coordinates system, and then the front can keep its simple behavior of showing the viewport on (0, 0).

In Sirius Desktop, the `elementView` variable (and all the `*View` variables actually) point to elements in the Sirius EMF model for diagrams (`DDiagram` and related). These do not exist in the same form in Sirius Web, so we do not provide the corresponding variable.
The most common use case for `elementView`, like yours, is to get the semantic elements at the source or target of the edge.
For this we provide the `semanticEdgeSource` and `semanticEdgeTarget` variables instead, which can replace the expressions `element.sourceNode.target` and `element.targetNode.target`.
You can uses these in your _Element Expression_ and it should work in Sirius Web, but unfortunately it will stop working in Sirius Desktop (which does not provide this variable, at least at the time).

1. in Sirius Web, ""cheat"" and provide the Desktop variables as fake objects which respond to the same kind of queries (e.g. here expose a `target` attribute which points to the semantic element). This would need quite a lot of work and would probably be very brittle.
2. in Sirius Desktop, add the same variables as mentioned above (`semanticEdgeSource` and `semanticEdgeTarget`), and maybe others as needed. This depends on what people are actually doing with `elementView` & co. in their VSMs: progressively identify the most common (and ""legitimate"") usage patterns/expressions, and expose the result of the expressions directly as variables that can be available in both versions of Sirius. At some point we could deprecate the direct `*View` variables in Sirius Desktop if we are confident we support all the legitimate use cases with more direct variables.

They are not incompatible but the second option seems preferable in the long term.

## Developer Guide

This sections describes the main APIs that are exposed by the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler to build custom modelers and extend the platform.

Every instance of the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler is a custom Spring Boot application built by using reusable frontend and backend components provided by the Open Source Sirius Components project. When running on the entreprise version of the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler, additional, proprietary components are available to provide more features, but the principles are the same.

The Sirius Web repository provides an example of a complete, ready-to-run studio based on the Open Source components. It can be used as a starting point to create your own modeler.
### 4. Business Domain Definition

While the architecture of the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler is not tied to the Eclipse Modeling Framework, EMF models are currently the first supported type of domain models.

If you have an existing EMF metamodel which represents your business domain, to use it in you modeler you need to:

1. Make sure the JARs for the metamodel itself and its .edit support are in your application’s classpath. Typically this involves publishing the two JARs in a Maven repository and adding their coordinates into your sample application’s POM file. Example in Sirius Web.

2. Register your metamodel in your application. This is done by creating a Spring @Configuration which provides your meta-model’s EPackage and AdapterFactory as Spring @Beans. Example in Sirius Web.

3. Provide an implementation of org.eclipse.sirius.web.api.services.IImagePathService which tells Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler in which folders (relative to the root of the JAR) the icons for your metamodel types can be found. Example in Sirius Web.

If you do not yet have an EMF-based domain model, you can use Ecore Tools to design and implement it, and then follow the same steps as above.
### 5. Sirius Desktop Compatibility

Modelers based on the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler can reuse Sirius Desktop modeler definition files (.odesign files). Only a subset of the Sirius Desktop features are currently supported, but you can safely use a complete odesign file in the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler. The features which are not supported at the moment will simply be ignored. Future versions of the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler will increase the scope of Sirius Desktop features supported. If you rely on specific features from Sirius Desktop, do not hesitate to contact us.

The Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler currently only supports a subset of Sirius diagrams and properties views. Tables, trees, and sequence diagrams are not supported at the moment.

For diagrams, the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler currently supports the main features of:

* nodes and containers;

* relation-based and element-based edges;

* border nodes;

* style customizations;

* creation tools, direct-edit tools, generic tools.

For properties view, the following widgets are supported:

* text fields and text areas;

* checkboxes;

* radio buttons;

* select/combos;

* lists (read-only).

To use an existing odesign modeler definition in the Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler:

1. Make sure the JAR which contains the modeler definition is in your application’s classpath. Typically this involves publishing the .design JAR in a Maven repository and adding its coordinates into your sample application’s POM file. Example in Sirius Web.

2. In your application, provide a Spring @Configuration which implements org.eclipse.sirius.web.compat.services.api.ISiriusConfiguration and tells the platform the path (inside the JAR) where the .odesign file is available. Example in Sirius Web

### Steps to reproduce

* On a diagram with an edge and a label, move one of the nodes attached to the edge.
* During the move, the edge itself moves correctly, and the label moves also.
* *However*,  at the end of the move, the edge's label position does not completely match the expected location. This is resolved automatically and one sees the label smoothly moving to its final location. This is not ideal, but worse is that during the animation the diagram is unresponsive. The animation is _relatively_ fast, and it's not that visible on the above video, but in practice it is rather annoying and breaks the flow.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new diagram on which there is an edge ""to self"", i.e. with the same node as both source and target.
2. The initial, automatic, layout is correct (see the first part of the video above).
3. Start moving any element on the diagram.

### Expected behavior

The routing of the edge and placement of its label should stay consistent.
In the example on the video, the edge and its label should keep exactly the same layout/routing and simply move along the node.

### Actual behavior

- The edge's routing is broken. It seems that at least one bendpoint is added, the the source/target anchors do not stay on the same side.
- The edge's label is completely off.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open a diagram.
2. Select an element to make the contextual palette appear.
3. Click & drag the diagram background to scroll/pan, or use the scroll whell (or the toolbar buttons) to zoom in/out.
4. The palette stays open at the initial position, which does not make sense anymore.

IMO it should simply be hidden as soon as the scroll or zoom starts.

### Steps to reproduce

- Initialise sample sirius-web app to use an odesign file that contains Acceleo 3/MTL expressions like `['vocab' + container.vocabularies->size() /]` ([source](https://github.com/eclipse/lyo.designer/blob/master/org.eclipse.lyo.tools.toolchain.design/description/ToolChainModel.odesign#L1507)).
- Create a new model
- Create a new representation
- Add an item to the diagram

### Expected behavior

- An item is created and added to the diagram with default values evaluated to some values.

### Actual behavior

- An item is created and added to the diagram with Acceleo 3 expressions as default values verbatim.

I see that in https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/master/backend/sirius-web-interpreter/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/interpreter/ExpressionConverter.java there is handling code for all kinds of expressions except Acceleo 3. Do we need to perform extra configuration to get them working or does Sirius Web not support Acceleo 3 at all?

The behavior of a concrete Sirius-based modeler (be it Sirius Desktop or Sirius Web) is defined by a _representation description_ which is interpreted at runtime. These contain (among other things) _tool definitions_ which define what modification(s) to perform on the model when the end-user triggers the tool. Most tools have a very simple beahvior (e.g. change the value of an attribute, create a new `EObject`, etc.) but they can actually perform (almost) arbritrary manipulations on the model.

If your modeler is defined using a Sirius Desktop `odesign` file, please refer to [the documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/Sirius%20Specifier%20Manual.html) on how to define the behavior of your tools (but note that Sirius Web does not currently support all features of Sirius Desktop modeler definitions.

If your modeler is defined directly using the Sirius Web APIs (i.e. you provide a `org.eclipse.sirius.web.diagrams.description.DiagramDescription` instance that you built programmatically), at some point you need to provide a `org.eclipse.sirius.web.diagrams.tools.CreateNodeTool` which has a handler of type `Function<VariableManager, Status>`. The Java function you provide here will get (through the `VariableManager`) information about the element (`EObject`) on which the user invoked your tool, and from there you can use classical Java/EMF APIs to perform the model manipulations you want.

Note that for diagrams we currently only support _CreateNodeTool_ and _CreateEdgeTool_, but the core does not really care what they do, and a _CreateNodeTool_ can actually do something else than creating a new node.

Right now I am using an .odesign file to define my representation. The problem i have with tools is that they are always triggered by end-user as you have written. I want them to be triggered from an external event or something similar. 
To give an example with the flow model: I do not want to insert the temperature of the system manually but from an external source (e.g. the ""real"" System).

Then the approach would be to extend our GraphQL API with custom mutations that correspond to the external events, and then invoke these mutations from the external system.
That's how the frontend asks the backend to perform operations, and the mechanism is extensible.

Have a look at the existing mutations like for example `org.eclipse.sirius.web.graphql.datafetchers.mutation.MutationCreateChildDataFetcher`. Adding a new one can be a little cumbersome but not complicated (at least if you are already familiar with GraphQL).

Basically you need:
* an input type which represents the parameters of the mutation (e.g. `org.eclipse.sirius.web.services.api.objects.CreateChildInput`)
* a data fetcher that GraphQL will invoke (with the input as argument) when it receives the mutation request (e.g. `org.eclipse.sirius.web.graphql.datafetchers.mutation.MutationCreateChildDataFetcher`
* make sure the mutation and new types you add are correctly registered in the GraphQL Schema
* in your data fetcher implementation, follow the pattern used by `MutationCreateChildDataFetcher` for example to dispatch the request to the `editingContextEventProcessorRegistry`, which itself will dispatch it to the `IEditingContextEventProcessor` that handles the target project (each project has a single event processor to manage it)
* create an actual event handler following the model of `org.eclipse.sirius.web.spring.collaborative.handlers.CreateChildEventHandler`; it will get invoked in the proper context where you can have access to the actual model instances.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTMxOTcwNTE=/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open a _Topography_ diagram on the _Robot Flow_ sample
2. Select a node, say ""Radar""
3. Start typing the string `""renamed""`
4. The direct edit behavior is triggered but the initial letter `r` was lost
5. Validate the edit
6. The final name is `""enamed""`

What's strange is more that it seems to work under macOS...

AFAICT, the process is:

* In `DependencyInjection.ts` we setup a `KeyListener` which does something like:
```js
if (event.code === 'F2') {
  return [{ kind: EditLabelAction.KIND, element }];
} else if (validFirstInputChar(event)) {
  return [{ kind: EditLabelAction.KIND, element }];
}
```
i.e. in both case we simply trigger Sprotty's edit label action, but without passing it any info about the event/char that triggered it.

* The action is handled in `WebSocketDiagramServer.tsx` by dispatching a `new EditLabelAction(label.id)` to Sprotty, which ends up calling Sprotty's `EditLabelUI`. This creates a new `input` element in the DOM to accept the new text, and during its initialization, `onBeforeShow` it calls `applyTextContents` which does `this.inputElement.value = this.label.text;`, i.e. it initializes the contents of the new `input` element with the current text of the label.

This seems consistent with the current behavior, except for 2 issues:
* under Safari, the new `input` seems to be initialized with the first char entered to trigger the label edition. I don't understand how (and don't have access to a mac to test further).
* if I pass the `firstChar` to the action we send to `WebSocketDiagramServer`, and there update the label's text value before calling Sprotty's `EditLabelUI`, the new text label is not the one used to initialize the `input` either.

The root of the issue is that when we delete model elements, we do not delete ""orphan"" representations which point to them (as their `targetObjectId`. These stay in the database, and because the onboarding area's query does not check for this it finds and displays them. 
Then on open in `DiagramCreationService.refresh(IEditingContext, IDiagramContext)`, the test for
```java
if (optionalObject.isPresent() && optionalDiagramDescription.isPresent()) {
```
is false because the `optionalObject` no longer exists. `refresh` returns `Optional.empty()`, and in `DiagramEventProcessor` we pass `null` to `DiagramContext.update()` in this case:

```java
        Diagram diagram = this.diagramCreationService.refresh(editingContext, diagramContext).orElse(null);
        diagramContext.update(diagram);
```

There are actually (at least) 4 issues:
* the two lines above in `DiagramEventProcessor` are broken: we explicitly transform an empty optional into `null` to pass it to a method which does not accept `null`;
* the onboarding area should be more strict in what it displays (but that is more of a workaround, and given that its content is not dynamic it could display a valid representation at a time _t_ which has become invalid at _t+n_ when the user tries to open it;
* the error message displayed in case an error occurs while opening a representation is probably too generic;
* the underlying issue is that we should remove representations which have become invalid because their target object no longer exists. When and how to do this without disrupting the user's workflow (which may have the representation opened at the time) will require some thought.

Whether this is indeed a bug is debatable. My own expectations was that the click would abort the edition, but maybe the current behavior is what we want. In that case it should be an explicit decision and propably documented (and this issue closed as invalid).

### Steps to reproduce
It needs two browsers.
- From _Browser 1_, the user creates a project, a _Robot flow_ model, and a _Typography_ representation.
- On _Browser 2_, the user should see the project he created in _Browser 1_, in the project browser.
- From _Browser 2_, the user deletes the project.

### Expected behavior
On _Browser 1_ there should be a notification the instant the project is deleted from Browser 2.
Then, the user should be redirected to the project browser.

### Actual behavior
On _Browser 1_, the Project Explorer, the Diagram Editor the Details View became empty.

An error is thrown in the console if the user closes the diagram editor.

* the initial witdh of the explorer is relatively small, and almost as soon as you has elements with ""reasonable"" labels 1 or 2 levels deep, their context menu (the vertical ""..."") is invisible until you resize it;
* the explorer shows a vertical scroll bar even when not needed, which does not help the point above as it takes additional horizontal space;
* both the explorer and the details view can be resized until they are completely invisible, and then it's not that easy to click on the border to drag it and make them visible again. While it could probably be useful to be able to hide these temporarily, some kinf of collapse/expand action would probably be better;
* both the onboarding area and the representation view have broken behavior when they do not have enoug horizontal space: the ""leak"" onto the other area (see screenshot below)

Some operations like deleting a representation or an element (and all its descendants) from the explorer are destructive, but currently they do not ask for confirmation before.
Deleting a whole document _does_ ask for confirmation, but there is no particular reason to treat documents differently from e.g. the root elements inside of them (deleting _them_ is as impacting as deleting the document).


### Solution

Make the confirmation dialog available on all concepts of the explorer (objects, representations, etc)

### Rabbit holes

### No-gos

* A large set of validation rules for specific DSLs
* Dynamic contributions of additional validation rules.

### Test

* [ ] Automated developer tests merged and pass (with reasonable code coverage)
* [ ] Automated End-to-End tests  merged and pass (Cypress)
* [ ] Feature/bug fix manually tested/validated by at least one person not involved in the implementation
* [ ] Collaborative tests passed by hand

I think now would be the right time to introduce a generic deletion confirmation modal and use it for relevant operations from the explorer:
* document removal;
* item removal;
* representation removal (Slightly less critical, the most you can lose at the moment is a custom layout. Other that than you can always recreate a structurally equivalent representation.)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add to `SampleSiriusConfiguration` from https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web a Sirius model configuration for [ToolChainModel.odesign](https://github.com/eclipse/lyo.designer/blob/master/org.eclipse.lyo.tools.toolchain.design/description/ToolChainModel.odesign). It will reference [vocabulary.ecore](https://github.com/eclipse/lyo.designer/blob/master/org.eclipse.lyo.oslc4j.adaptormodel/model/vocabulary.ecore).
2. Add a bean method for providing an `AdaptorFactory` to be an instance of `VocabularyItemProviderAdapterFactory` ([package](https://github.com/eclipse/lyo.designer/tree/master/org.eclipse.lyo.tools.vocabulary.model/src/vocabulary)).
3. Add a bean method for providing an `EPackage` to return `VocabularyPackage.eINSTANCE`.
4. Add a bean method to supply for LabelFeature and Editable switches.
5. Add a stereotype description to `StereotypeDescriptionRegistryConfigurer`.
6. Launch the sample web application.

### Expected behavior

When I try to add a new element to a model, the initial AQL expression for the element is evaluated correctly.

1. I add a new element to the model.
2. The element creation includes some actions that need to be evaluated using AQL. For example, setting the element name with `aql:'Class ' + container.classes->size()`.
3. The element name should evaluate to `""Class 3""` if there are already 2 elements in the model.

### Actual behavior

The element name is always evaluated to `""Class ""`, the AQL is evaluated incorrectly. AQL expression that do not rely on the `vocabulary.ecore` ECore model seem to run fine.

---

We have investigated the AQLInterpreter and found that it rejects our Vocabulary EPackage as invalid. 
We tried two possible fixes:

1. Replace the workspace reference to the .ecore from the .odesign to a URI reference just like in the Flow model.
2. Replace the implementation config in the genmodel from `MinimalEObjectImpl` to the default one.

Neither change seems to help (nor both together).

From what I see in the screenshot the first solution you mention (referencing the metamodel's nsURI from the odesign instead of a workspace path (which only makes sense in an Eclipse context) should work.
Maybe there is something specific in how you set up your projects and their dependencies. We never had this specific issue, but maybe by chance. Hopefully we will find the issue later today during the SiriusCon Clinic.

Note that the implementation class (`MinimalEObjectImpl` or other) should not have any impact here. This only applies to the actual instances of your metamodel, not to the `EPackage(Impl)` itself which is at issue here.

We can close this issue, the resolution is to:

1. Use a URI to reference an Ecore model instead of a workplace reference.
2. Make sure the URI reference terminates with the characters `#/` (no changes are necessary to the Ecore model Ns URI)

Also, as you have indicated, the right place to verify the fix was correct is after `resource.load()` in the [`ODesignReader`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/v0.2.19/backend/sirius-web-compatibility/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/compat/services/representations/ODesignReader.java#L96) (the metamodel shall contain real instances of the EPackages and not EMF proxies):

### Description
Using my own custom model, symbol connection breaks when vertical scroll bars appears in the properties side panel.

The connection issue usually appears if the browser window height is less than the height of the right side panel (causing vertical scroll bars to appear).

As the properties side panel for a symbol gets longer as more symbols are connected to, there (eventually) comes a point that connections stop working regardless of the browser size.

The issue appears on small screen, 13' or when simply using a smaller window. 

### Screenshots

### Steps to reproduce
 1. Create many symbols, say 25
2. Start connecting them to single symbol, the properties side panel this symbol gets longer as more symbols are connected to

If you can't reproduce the error, try moving the diagram, or set Chrome zoom to 200%, to force the scroll bar.

Sirius Web already uses Tomcat as its servlet enging, but indirectly via Spring Boot which does the heavy lifting for us.

I'm not familiar enough with Tomcat to help you directly, but it seems there are ways to deploy a Spring Boot app into Tomcat, see for example https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-war-tomcat-deploy
We use Spring Boot in a very ""classical"" way, so any general documentation on how to deploy Spring Boot apps into Tomcat should apply.

These are based on simple heuristics and may not work for all domains, and even if they do the studio maker needs to be able to provide his own tools with custom behavior.

The studio maker should be able to specify different kinds of tools in the same way he define diagram elements.

We will support the following kinds of tools:
* **node tools**: associated to a _node description_ element, accessible in the contextual palette of the node instances and triggered by a single click. The actual tool's behavior can be to _create_ a new (child) node, but this is not required.
* **edge tools**: associated to an _edge description_ element, accessible in the contextual palette of the node instances of the edge's source type, and requiring the selection of a target node (instance of the edge description's target type). Again, the actual behavior may be to create an edge between the two elements but that is nor required.
* **delete tool**: can be associated to a node or edge description, invoked on delete (via the keyboard of the ""Delete"" action in the contextual palette)
* **direct edit tool**: can be associated to a node or edge description, invoked on direct edit (via the keyboard of the ""Edit"" action in the contextual palette)

The actual behavior of a tool is defined in its _body_ which is made of a sequence/tree of _operations_ (as in a Sirius Desktop VSM). We will only support a limited set of operations at first, and improve that later.

### Expected behavior

Sirius Desktop supports `RoundedCornerStyleDescription` with separate `arcWidth` and `arcHeight` attributes for various of its styles.

We will support a single `borderRadius` property at first. In the compatibility layer, if both `arcWidth` and `arcHeight` are set we will take the highest value.

### Cuttings backs

Ideally we would support the whole [CSS `border-radius`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) features, to allow for different radius on each of the 4 corners. This is not directly supported by SVG's `<rect/>` element but it could certainly be implemented by combining/overlaying mutiple `rect` with different radius settings.

### Potential side effects

Edges which are connected to a rectangle or list container use the container's rectangular bounding box to compute their anchors, so with rounded corners the anchors can possibly looking disconnected. But this problem is already present with images for example.

In these tools we want to be able to invoke Java services to perform more complex computations, invoke web-based APIs, etc.
This requires having the corresponding Java code deployed in the backend  (and thus a rebuild/redeploy), and for the moment that's fine, but we need a mechanism to _bind_ such Java service classes to a particular Diagram definition.

In the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer, we rely on the `JavaExtension` element in the VSM to find the Java services classs needed and provide them to the AQL interpreter (see `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.compatibility.AQLInterpreterFactory.getJavaServices(Viewpoint)`.

For now we will follow the same pattern, and have an element in the View DSL equivalent to the `JavaExtension` element in Sirius Desktop.

We need to help end users find out the mistake that they can introduce while editing models.

### Solution

First, the current views of the workbench would have a tab indicating their name (Explorer and Properties). The workbench would then be improved in order to support multiple views in the right area with the arrival of the Validation view. This new view would be used to display validation results using a representation.

A new representation would be contributed to the backend in order to compute the validation results. As an example, some basic validation rules for the `Domain` and `View` DSL will be contributed, such as:

* Detect domains without a name or uri
* Detect node descriptions without a proper domain type

* A large set of validation rules for specific DSLs

We need to provide quick feedback on validation issues to the end users

Add validation results to all existing fields of the properties view. For that, the definition of a form will have some support for validation results. We will contribute an example for the `View` DSL which defines its own properties definition.

When we create new elements in the Domain or View DSL, most of the fields are empty. This helps creating invalid definitions.

### Solution

Populate some of the properties with relevant default values.

#### Domain DSL

- [ ] All elements should be created with an initial non-null name.

#### View DSL

- [ ] All attributes should be created with valid/non-empty values.
  - [ ] Styles currently have `rgb(0, 0, 0)` as both color and border color (which is used for text), meaning the default is an unreadble ""black on black"".
  - [ ] Conditions on conditional styles should be initialized with `aql:false`. Technically this does not change anything (an empty expression is treated as a false one), but it makes things more explicit.
- [ ] Object creation from the explorer delegates to EMF Edit's `collectNewChildDescriptors`, so be should customize this to automatically create required children elements. In particular both node and edge descriptions should be created with a default style already set.

We need to be able to open a dialog when a tool is used to select some elements before executing the behavior of the tool.

### Solution

Some information will be added to the relevant tools to indicate that prior to their ""real"" execution, they should start by displaying a dialog showing a ""Selection"" representation. This representation will be used to display a flat list of objects for the moment. The end user will be able to select some of those objects and validate the selection.

After that, the frontend will send the request to perform the execution of the tool to the backend along with the identifier of the selected objects. A small sample will be contributed with hard coded values for Flow as an example.

I'd have to test again to confirm, and see if there are other similar issues that could be fixed in EMF JSON directly to make the system more resilient to small changes like this.

Our APIs and some of our lifecycle operations are still tightly couple with the expectation of a project.

### Solution

Rename all occurrences of projectId to editingContextId and make sure we properly leverage the editing context indirection. For example in the GraphQL schema, the field `Project#representation` and `Project#representations` should probably move to the type `EditingContext`.

Worse, the actually important part (the object's name/label) is the one which is most likely invisible or truncated.
Because the context menu icon is at the right of the tree items, it too is almost always inaccessible with the default explorer width.

The type information can be useful in some situations (although to be *really* useful it should be completed with the containment feature name), but it could be moved to a tooltip for example so that it is only visible when needed.

* _As_ a studio maker,

* _so that_ my domain definition can match the actual domain more closely (and not have to map *every* concept into numbers, strings and booleans).

### Solution

I see 3 kinds of ""custom types"" we may want to support:
* custom enumerated types (mapped to EMF's `EEnums`);
* new types ""derived"" from the hard-coded ones (`number` / `string`) but with additional constraints. For example a `Percentage` which derives from `number` with an additional constraint (that would be used by validation) to be between 0 and 100.
* completely custom types mapped into Java types existing on the backend (equivalent to EMF's `EDataType`). We do not want to allow for the studio maker to allow for any random Java class from the backend to be usable here, so we would need an explicit mechanism for the backend to expose types that can be used like this. For example we may want an `instant` type which maps into `java.time.Instant`, custom types to represent colors, etc.

The main challenge is how to model this at the EMF level as the ""core"" types are defined at the ""meta"" level but the custom ones are in the instance.

### Solution

The easiest solution is to follow the same approach as EMF, with a `defaultValueLitteral` field on attributes definition, which will get parsed as an instance of the corresponding type. In case of parsing or typing error, we simply revert to the default value for the generic type (e.g. ""0"" for numbers, ""false"" for booleans, """" (empty string) for strings).

* _As_ a studio maker,
* _when_ defining my custom business domain,
* _I want to_ be able to set a custom icon and label expression for my types,
* _so that_ their instances are displayed in a more meaningfull way to users.

At the moment, all instances of dynamically defined domains use a generic hard-coded icon, and get their label (in the explorer) computed using a generic heuristic (use the first string-typed attribute).

### Solution

This is related to #563 as we need a way to:
* contribute images the can be used as icons (maybe not by the studio maker himself, this could be an admin-level operation);
* select one of the available icons (ideally not from *all the images* available on the server, as many will not be adapted) to associate with a custom `Entity` in its properties page;
* associate the proper image with instances of the `Entity` at runtime. Currently `ObjectService.getImagePath(Object)` relies on an EMF `AdapterFactory` to provide an `IItemLabelProvider`, so either `DomainConverter` must be extended to also provide such an `AdapterFactory`, or we need a custom mechanism.

For the labels, `Entity` could have a computed `labelExpression`, but the way labels and direct edition is currently handled in the explorer would make it difficult to integrate it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/595/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to reproduce

Sometimes (almost systematic for me), right after opening a project, the context menu on explorer elements does not open.
It's still possible to expand/collapse and select elements, but clicking on the 3 dots to open an item's menu does not do anything.
No error message shows up in the console (neither in the browser nor on the backend).

Refreshing the page in the browser fixes the issue.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new project `studio`. The studio definition feature must of course be enabled.
2. Create a new domain with two entities `Root` and `Child`
3. Add a containment relation `Root.child : Child`. Keep it single-valued.
4. Create a new project, `instance`.
5. In it, create an instance of `Root` and a `Child` inside of it.
6. Close the `instance` project. You might need to wait a little bit (unless you customized `org.eclipse.sirius.web.editingContextEventProcessorRegistry.disposeDelay` to a low enough value).
7. In the `studio` project, make the `child` relation multi-valued.
8. Re-open the `instance`: it would be natural to still have the `Child` element inside `Root`, but it is gone.

The backend's log shows this error:

### Analysis

When loading the previously saved document, Sirius EMF JSON sees that the `child` feature in the current definition of the metamodel is multi-valued, so it expects to read the values in a JSON array. But at the time the document was saved the feature was single-valued so it was serialized as a JSON object.

### Expected Behavior

* When reading a multi-valued feature, Sirius EMF JSON should accept (maybe only if a particular option is set) single values.
* Conversely, when reading a single-valued feature, Sirius EMF JSON should accept multiple values (arrays), and only consider the first one (or consider the feature not to be set if the array is empty).

- [x] add the same kind of support to references handling.
- [ ] make the new behavior opt-out via an option. It really changes the behavior and in some cases can lead to data loss (when loading previously multi-valued feature with a metamodel where they are now single-valued), and in some use cases clients might prefer a clear error/crash than a silent loss of data.
- [ ] bump the Sirius EMF JSON version, build/release it, and consume the new version in Sirius Components
- [ ] add some tests, at least in Sirius Components to validate the scenario described above

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new project.
2. Create two models M1 and M2 in it. They will (usually) be displayed in this order, M1 before M2.
3. Go back to the projects browser.
4. Re-open the project: sometimes M1 is still before M2, sometimes it's the other way around.

This is a relatively small issue, but quite confusing/annoying in practice.

Either the documents should have an intrinsic order inside the projects (the order of creation would be the most meaningful from and end-user point of view, but that requires schema changes; maybe ordering by their id could do at first), or there is no intrinsic order but the presentation layer orders them in a consistent way (probably by name, even though this means the order will change if the models are renamed).

2. if the corresponding attribute is optional, once a value has been set once, with a radio group it is impossible to unset it.

Moving to a `Select` (combo) widget would solve both issues:
1. it is more compact in terms of UI space used
2. it allows for a _None_ value to be added in the possible choices if and only if the underlying attribute is optional. (Yes, technically we could also add a _none_ choice to the radio group, but this means even more space taken, and IMO feels less clear when such a button would be selected).

First, there is a good reason for features like `org.eclipse.sirius.web.view.DiagramElementDescription.getDomainType()` to be plain strings and not single-valued references to `domain::Entity` elements (which would automatically produce the kind of UI we're lookong for here). If we did this, deleting an Entity which is referenced by a View definition in another project (and thus not saved together) would create dangling/proxy elements in the underlying EMF model (at best) or make them unloadable at all (and thus unfixable) at worst. In Sirius Desktop's VSMs, the choice to keep the ""domain class"" attributes plain string was made explicitly to reduce the coupling between the semantic metamodel and the VSMs. It has drawbacks (partial breakage of a VSM can happen silently), but with some validation on top the trade off has been rather successful.

Using strings instead of references would also in theory allow for ""special values"" and/or a mini-language to be more specific. For example, currently when we set the domain type to `SomeType`, all instances of that type _and any subtype_ will match. We could provide a special syntax to expression ""exactly this type and not a subtype of it"" (for example `=SomeType`). Or allow for multiple domain types (which could certainly also be done with multi-valued references), e.g. `TypeA | =TypeB`. I'm not saying these are good ideas :smile:, just that keeping this a string keeps thhings very flexible.

So assuming we keep these attributes as plain strings but want to present them via Select widgets:

* We need to provide whole custom details pages for the `DiagramDescription`, `NodeDescription` and `EdgeDescrition` types. As soon as we want to customize *one* of the widgets normally produced by the detault rules, we currently need to override and re-implement the whole page. See `ViewPropertiesConfigurer` which already does this for the Select widget for images.
* Finding all the valid candidate Entity types is relatively trivial, at least if we reduce the scope to domains defined inside the current editing context. Otherwise there can be several issues:
    * a potentiel performance issue if we need to scan all the domain definitions in all projects in the database to fill the combo;
    * a scoping issue: currently there is no way (at the moment) to prefix/scope domain types, so it's impossible to distinguish between types defined in different domains with the same name.
    * a UI issue: do we really want the studio maker working on his DSL to see possibly dozens of completely unrelated choices coming from domain definitions in other projects?
* Finally how to handle the lifecycle of the widget when the ""referenced"" (by name) entity has been removed of renamed. In this case the ""current"" value of the attribute does not correspond to any of the currently valid choices. The current value _must_ be among the possible choices for the Select widget to work, but we would like to make it clear that it is not valid. Would a simple suffix (e.g. ""(invalid)"") on the label and the accompanying validation rule be enough?

It has been decided the default value for the feature _Optional_ of _Relation_ has to be `true`, which is something Ecore is not able to do with ease. To do so, _DomainFactoryImpl_ has been modified.

There is two possible expected behavior:
- The project should be renamed if we consider the maximum of possible characters as valid (The frontend say so), and thus, the server should not return an error
- The server should return an error (as it currently does), but the dialog should be invalid

To summarize, the frontend and the backend should be consistent.

1. Export an existing project with diagrams with incremental layout
2. Delete the project
3. Upload the project : for diagrams with manual layout, their layout should correspond to the manual layout at the time of export. But it is not the case, the manual layout is lost.

I think that's why its current implementation is to only take the representation's metadata, wrap them in a `CreateRepresentationInput` and send that to `editingContextEventProcessor::handle`.

Note that this means that this issue seen here on diagrams is also very probably present in all other representation kinds which have an actual state: Portal, Gantt and Decks...

I think we would need either an `Optional<IRepresentation> stateToRestore` additional parameter to `CreateRepresentationInput` (and then use that in `CreateDiagramEventHandler` & co.) or a clearly disinct `ImportRepresentationInput` (or `CloneRepresentationInput` or whatever) and implementations for *all* representations we support.

There are two main solutions to build a GraphQL schema, using a code first approach in which the schema is an artifact derived from the source code, which is the approach that we have embraced until now and the schema first approach in which the schema is the main source of truth and the code is derived (manually or automatically) from this schema.

Both approaches have various advantages and drawbacks, one of the main advantages of the code first approach is to have the code perfectly synchronized with the schema but it is harder to reason about the schema and communicate with others about changes on the schema.

At scale, multiple companies have embraced a schema first approach to have a better medium to synchronize multiple teams. Such change will also enable us to use other GraphQL frameworks instead of our own custom framework which made sense when we first started but which make less sense today with new solutions such as Netflix DGS.

### Solution

We will provide a text based version of the core part of our GraphQL schema used by Sirius Components. This schema will contain at least the following concepts:

- EditingContext
- Diagram related concepts (data structure, mutations, subscriptions)
- Form and Properties related concepts (data structure, mutations, subscriptions)
- Tree and Explorer related concepts (data structure, mutations, subscriptions)
- Validation related concepts (data structure, subscription)
- Selection related concepts (data structure, subscription)

All the concepts used by the frontend parts of the workbench should be available.

In order to support some additional use cases, we may need to provide additional variables to apply some tools. We also need to document the variables available for the various functions.

### Solution

We will create a small document listing the variables available for the various functions starting with the diagram part and we will figure out which variable are missing (and why) and add them where it is necessary.

This document will serve as the contract between Sirius Components and those who which to reuse it.

The `Status` returned while executing some functions is not very useful. It would be better to be able to return a proper payload.

### Solution

We will replace progressively our usage of `org.eclipse.sirius.web.representations.Status` by instances of `IPayload` in order to be able to return an ErrorPayload for invalid operations with appropriate messages.

We will move slowly on this topic because, while it seems straightforward, it will open a powerful API to a lot of code which will have to use it in a very limited scope. It will make possible some things which are not possible today but may also prevent us from doing things that we are actually doing today.

We may change our mind on this topic while trying to change the actual code so we won't start by removing `Status` and trying to fix all compilation issues but instead we will try to replace it progressively in the diagram part with all its functions (editLabelHandler, tools handlers, etc).

In order to let other projects reuse our workbench more easily, we will remove some hardcoded concepts from the workbench, especially the explorer.

### Solution

We will remove some of our hardcoded modeling concepts from the explorer such as `Document`, `Representation` etc and make it easier for anyone to build a workbench for projects with a very different structure (no more CreateDocumentModal hardcoded as a dependency of the explorer).

Some projects want to add new views to the left and right sites of the workbench.

### Solution

We will add the ability to contribute new views to those sites. The views will be statically contributed at build time only. We will not try to perform any magical layout on those sites anymore (LeftSite only for now) since the combinatorial explosion will be massive.

Contributors will should only be able to provide the view with its name and content. A common TypeScript interface will be required in order to provide the same capabilities to all those views.

This issue should start with the contribution of an ADR and no development should start before the approval of said ADR.

Our GraphQL API provides too many ways to retrieve a representation. All those APIs are unused and not really useful either. Their existence for us to provide the ability to manipulate a complete representation are various parts of our APIs. Providing only the metadata would be more useful.

We will replace the manipulation of the representations at various places of our API by their metadata only.

Projects integrating Sirius Components can face difficulties with our constraint for UUID identifier which lack some contextual information for some use cases. There are two ways to solve this issue:

- We could provide additional information pretty much everywhere
- We could let other projects define their custom identification policy

The first approach would require us to synchronize a lot of information without need per se for Sirius Components so we will opt for the second approach.

### Solution

Some of our identifiers will switch from `UUID` to `String` to let others implement complex identifiers easily (think primary key created from multiple columns in PostgreSQL).

New use cases made it clear that these particular components are not _that_ generic and actually deal with ""how to integrate the reusable components into a full-fledged application (with application-specific choices)"", and different applications may want to do things differently.

They have now been moved into the `sirius-web` repo, which currently does not publish its resulting JARs.

Currently the best way to consume the latest version is to fork/copy the whole `sirius-web` repo and adapt it. You may only need to adapt `sirius-web-sample-application` to register your own metamodel and modelers, but now you can also extend/customize the other integration components which are there if needed.

One thing to be aware of is that if you have `sirius-components` master (say at 0.4.6) in your Eclipse/STS workspace and a version of `sirius-web` (or a fork of it) which declares in its POMs to depend on an earlier version of `sirius-components` (say 0.4.3), m2e will use the version declared in the POMs, i.e. your `sirius-web` projects will get resolved against `sirius-components` 0.4.3 JARs, *not* the version in your workspace. This can cause confusing behaviors.

As of this writing, the `master` versions of `sirius-components` and `sirius-web` are aligned: they are both at v0.4.6, and `sirius-web` depends on `sirius-components` v0.4.6.

### Screenshots

In Sirius Desktop, I am using typical variables normally provided in the context of the action or representation I am programming. For example, when creating an element, I can use the ""container"" variable in my AQL code.
Similarly, when defining the Source Path Finder on an Edge element, I can make use of the ""diagram"" variable.

**Example1: Action code upon Element Creation** 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7108694/131409232-6df09259-c521-4caf-8729-fe9d1e806360.png)

### Expected & actual behavior
While these variables are available in Sirius Desktop, I get exceptions in Sirius Web when this same code needs to be executed. 
For example,

`2021-08-30 23:28:53.803  WARN 24312 --- [81-6784f7c74463] o.e.s.web.interpreter.AQLInterpreter     : An error has occurred with the expression 'aql:diagram.containers->select(c | c.visible).target->select(c | c.oclIsTypeOf(adaptorinterface::Resource)).oclAsType(adaptorinterface::Resource)->select(r | r.resourceProperties->includes(self))': Couldn't find the 'diagram' variable
`
Besides ""self"" what variables are available for a given action? How can one work out what is available, and what is not. (In sirius desktop, I make use of the direct explanations in the interface).

This is similar to the closed issue #408, which was related to ElementView variable.

In the context of an diagram element creation tool, the `container` variable defined in Sirius Desktop is just an alias for the current element (`self`) at the start of the execution of the tool. We could define it, but for now there is only `self`. The thing is that from the screenshot, the place where you want to use the variable is inside a _Create Instance_ operation, which will redefine the value of `self`.

I have not tested, but a workaround would be to wrap the body of your _Container Creation_ tool with a _Let_ operation to capture the initial value of `self`  in your own variable, and use that new variable instead of `container` in the _Set_'s _value Expression_.

I'm not really fond of the historical name `container`, which does not clearly indicate what it represents, but we could provide it as a compatibility feature for diagrams which are defined from an `odesign` file. I'll prepare a PR.

### `diagram` variable

In Sirius Desktop, this variable points to a `DDiagram` element, which is the EMF-based data structure Sirius Desktop uses to represent diagrams. Sirius Web has its own, completely different and non-EMF data structure for this, and we do not want to expose it (it would become API and be very difficult to change/improve afterwards). It wouldn't be of much use to you anyway as it does not implement the same APIs at all.

In general, when people had to resort to using this ""internal"" model in their modelers it was often to workaround some limitations and/or to improve performance via ""tricks"". We'd rather directly support the higher-level use cases, and be fast enough that performance tricks like this are not needed.

Can you describe what your AQL expression tries to achieve functionnaly?

I am willing to modify the model to suit both. But I wonder even this will be a realistic approach. I am aware that Sirius-web is still under development, but would be good to know already if this is a wise approach altogether.

### Container variable
I have done some experiments now, and ""container"" is the same as self.econtainer() (not self).
but this can solve my problem, thanks. 

### diagram variable
I  normally rely on the documented variables (see figure below) and didn't think these are internal. But granted, i could not expect a ""diagram"" to be available in Sirius-web. Anyway, I'll explain what I am trying to acheive. I will make use of UML to avoid the unnecessary specifics of our own domain language.
* Consider that I want to model inheritance between classes. If Class A is a sub-class of ClassB, I want to show an arrow from A to B. 
* Now, each Diagram can represent one or more UML-Packages, within which the classes are graphically represented.
* My model consists of many such package diagrams.
* So, it is a likely scenario that a diagram contains a graphical representation of Class A but not ClassB (since ClassB is in another package that is not in the same diagram).
* In such a scenario, since there can be no arrow representation of this inheritance, I want to textually write ""Class A extends ClassB"" in the label of Class A.

For this to work, I needed AQL logic that can tell me which objects are visible. I believe this also worked in case the user happened to also ""hide"" some specific graphical elements.

These were not technically internal (in the OSGi-sense for example), but they expose the implementation details of how Sirius Desktop represents diagrams, which makes them impossible (or at least very difficult) to evolve once people start (legitimately) to rely on them. We do not want to reproduce that mistake in Sirius Web.

I understand the use case, and it is valid. We could probably expose a higher-level Java service to answer the actual question you want to ask, i.e. something like ""is the semantic element X represented somewhere on this diagram?"". We'd need to think a little at the details to avoid creating something too specific to this particular scenario (so that over time we do not multiply ad-hoc services likes this).

A possible approach would be:
* in Sirius Web, expose a `diagram` variable, but make it an opaque object (*not* the actual `Diagram` data structure used by Sirius Web). On that opaque object, register an AQL service which corresponds to your use case (maybe generalized a little). Say for example `represents(EObject semanticElement)` (name to be discussed).
 * in Sirius Desktop, we could register an equivalent Java service on the `DDiagram` type which is used there. This could be added directly in your own modeler definition until maybe it would be available directly into Sirius Desktop later on.

On your side, your `odesign` model could use a single expression like `aql:diagram.represents(someSemanticElement)`, which would work the same in both Desktop and Web, just using different implementations underneath.

Another related question is also "" ""is the semantic element X represented somewhere within this ""container!""?""."" I am not sure if the 2 questions can be generalized into 1 service or not. But sometimes one want to also know if the element exists within a containing element.

Otherwise, the suggested approach looks good to me. Currrently, I have created my own Acceleo query to do this, because the current query is relatively complex.
For what it's worth, see the method `visibleResources (diagram : DSemanticDiagram)` which is then used to identify which specific elements are visible or not.

Yes, there are probably useful variants depending on the _context_ (the whole diagram or a particular container) and the _kind_ or representation (to filter on mapping types). What's tricky is that even if we expose a pseudo ""diagram"" (which is really just an opaque handle), there is no way to denote other _containers_ from an expression. And neither is there a direct way (except by name) to denote mappings.

The most general predicate which would cover all the cases would have this kind of signature:

    isRepresented(what: semanticElement, where: diagram | container, how: child | borderNode, by: mapping)

These four properties being what [uniquely identify](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/master/backend/sirius-web-diagrams/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/diagrams/components/NodeComponent.java#L249) an element on a diagram. But this is probably overkill for a first step, especially given that we do not have a good way for the specifier to denote containers and mappings.

AQL services support overloads, so starting with a much simpler version which only considers the diagram and semantic element would not prevent adding alternatives later. I'll have to think a little more about and maybe propose a first patch to discuss with the rest of the team. In particular, I'd like to see if such a service could be made efficient or if it will have to do a full walk on the diagram structure (which would be bad for an expression that can be invoked many many times during a single refresh depending on where it is used).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc42xVpb/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I was wondering if there is any planned progess on this issue?
We are also thinking if the following short term solution would be of benefit (until bug is fixed):
When uploading a model with a proxy object, instead of loading the missing/referenced EMF resource, simply remove that proxy reference? (and preferably mark the object as missing).
This means that one can still upload a model with proxy objects. Even if not 100% perfect, it can still be of value to have a less complete model.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5CvG0E/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently `CreateDiagramEventHandler.handle(IEditingContext, IInput)` uses that service to create (and refresh) a new diagram, and explicitly saves the result.
The second save is redundant (maybe it's optimised away by Hibernate, I don't know, but I don't think we should rely on it).

If the `save()` is removed from `DiagramCreationService`, it should be called from `DiagramEventProcessor.refresh()`.

Technically we could get the same result by keeping the `save()` call in `DiagramCreationService` and removing it from `CreateDiagramEventHandler`, but in terms of responsibility it seems cleaner to make `DiagramCreationService` side-effect free, and let both `CreateDiagramEventHandler` and `DiagramEventProcessor`, who explicitly deal with the lifecycle of diagrams, call `save()` themselves.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new project and upload the sample ""Flow"" model from this archive: [Big_Guy.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/7154371/Big_Guy.zip). It a synthetic Flow model created by duplicating the sample ""Robot.flow"" many times.
2. Open the top-level element of the model in the  explorer, and try to create a ""Topography"" diagram on it.

After waiting several minutes for the backend to create the diagram, I had to abandon and kill the server.

Measruing the CPU usage with YourKit reveals the issue is that the (initial) layout computation gets stuck inside `OverlapsUpdater`. I have not looked at the code but I suspect we're using a quadratic (or worse) algorithm there.

Note that creating a [_Topography with auto-layout_](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/Flow-Designer/blame/18454ea7c84a3bdd621fbf06c30ea29e7d98c13a/plugins/fr.obeo.dsl.designer.sample.flow.design/description/flow.odesign#L363) diagram instead, on the same element, is slow too but ends up finishing (after a few dozen seconds). Because that diagram has auto-layout enabled, we invoke `ILayoutService.layout()` instead of `ILayoutService.incrementalLayout()`, and thus bypass `OverlapsUpdater` completely.

The issue is that `ViewConverter.convert(View)` does not pass the `EPackage`s to the interpreter it instanciates.
It is relatively simple to pass _equivalent_ `EPackages` by using `this.editingContextEPackageService.getEPackages(editingContextId)`, but for packages corresponding to `Domain` definition, this will produce logically equivalent but distinct `EPackage` instances on every invocation.
In particular, this will produce `EPackages` which are distinct from the ones used by a project/editing context, and AQL expressions like `filter(domain::Type)` will always fail to match the actual objects inside a project.

    @Override
    public Flux<Boolean> canBeDisposed() {
        return this.canBeDisposedSink.asFlux().delayElements(Duration.ofSeconds(5));

It seems to work in practice, but feels quite _ad hoc_ and ""smelly"":
- which delay to use, and why?
- should the apply to all dialects?

It feels like there should be a more reliable way to detect that the event processor is *really* no longer needed, but I'm not sure as the front (and the network) can have an arbitrary lag and in theory we could receive events targetting an ""inactive"" event processor at any point in the future.

If we can not to better than adding a delay, we should also send some feedback to the client telling it the the request was dropped (and let it surface the info the end-user if relevant). AFAICT currently we simply log a message on the backend (""No representation event processor found for event"") and send a generic ""unexpected error"" to the client (maybe).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc43EylK/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I don't think that we can solve this problem in 100% of the use cases because of possible network lag but I think that adding a small delay would solve 90% of the occurrences of this problem. The current error message could be replaced by a more specific message indicating that the representation has maybe been disposed. or something like that. I think that we can have this issue with all representations but it's just visible with forms since it's very easy to reproduce it there.

A small variation of the code proposed above could make it work for all representations. By adding something like this:

representationEventProcessor.canBeDisposed().delayElements(Duration.ofSeconds(5))

Currently to id of the `IRepresentationDescription` this produces (in `ViewConverter`) only depends on that name, but that id is supposed to be globally unique.
If two dynamic representation descriptions have the same names, they will have the same id, and which one is returned at a given moment by `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService.findById(IEditingContext, UUID)` is undefined, which can lead at the very least to surprising behaviors or to crashes.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new studio project with a basic domain definition (say a Root entity containing Items).
2. Inside the same project, create a diagram description on Root which displays Items as blue rectangles.
3. Create an instance of the domain and diagram on a new project.
4. Create another project with a new diagram description on Root which displays Items as red rectangles. Give the diagram description the same name as the first one.
5. Go back to the instance project and reload: the blue rectangles turn red as the new diagram definition with the same name is picked up instead of the opriginal. (This may not happen every time as part of the behavior is not completely deterministic).

We can not (easily) have the same interactive behavior as Sirius Desktop, as the expressions can only be evaluated on then backend, and getting the same behavior would required requests to the backend every time the end user moves the cursor on a different element.
We *could* probably however let the creation request pass to the backend but check for these before actually executing the tool, and report a message to the end-user if the tool was not applied because of these.

This sounds like a logical solution :+1: 

I understand it will take some time to implement and may not be a priority at the moment. Is there any way I can replicate this functionality (disallowing edges to be created under certain conditions) in Sirius Web?
I am in control of the metamodel and the Sirius Web app, so I can modify both and hardcode the condition somewhere.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc44pUX0/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Cuttings backs

I don't know what this section means.

### Potential side effects

Not sure.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Users can delete the edge and create a new one, or change source/target in the _Details_ pane. The former solution results in subpar UX, the latter does not leverage the UI and requires picking an element from a potentially long list.

### Model
The model owns somewhere an entity with an attribute of type string. There is currently not the information about if the string is mono or multiline.
So let's consider that or line return is serialized with `\n`
The end-user '\n' string will be serialized escaped with '\\n'

### Representation
Every representation of a string attribute should manage the mono or multiline information based on th `\n` character

### Form representation
By default, the form representation represents a string with a textField. But a string could also be represented by a textArea

The textField will display `\n` with `\n` and `\\n` with `\\n`

The textArea will display `\n` with a carriage return and `\\n` with `\n`

### Sprotty

The label will display `\n` with a carriage return and `\\n` with `\n`
Idem when editing the text

As a second step, we could configure a maximum text length for the label display. That means that if the label is longer than the maximum length, a line is cut and returned as many times to comply with the maximum length

### backend layout
The ELK and incremental layout should adapt to mange the fact the a label can be displayed on many lines.

### Steps to reproduce

Add an image larger than 16x16 px as an icon for a node

### Expected behavior

The icon is moved to the left so that there is a gap between it and the node label.

Here is how it would look if the `x` property for that node was `-36` (it was `-20` initially, and `-20 - (32/2) = -36`)

### Actual behavior

The icon is rendered assuming its size is 16px.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/782/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Here the node at the top and its border node are plain nodes and their border size and color is correctly represented.
At the bottom, both the image node and its own border node have the same border configurations as the ones above, but neither have a visible border.

The issue is that the border (size, style, color) is completely ignored for image nodes (whether they are border nodes or not):

* `org.eclipse.sirius.components.compatibility.diagrams.WorkspaceImageDescriptionConverter` does not consider the border-related properties of the `WorkspaceImageDescription` (color, line style, size computation expression);
* `org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.ImageNodeStyle` does not support them anyway;
* the corresponding types (and code) on the frontend also needs to be made aware of these properties.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a _Label Expression_ for a node (maybe only a bordered node?)
2. Edit the label

Editing the label is not allowed since it is produced by an aql expression (which could be arbitrary).

Editing the label is allowed, but doing so leads to no visible change.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/784/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Looks like the code is pointing there: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/0fe4572463080222683ae698f7fe15719a178bea/backend/sirius-web-emf/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/emf/compatibility/modeloperations/RemoveElementOperationHandler.java#L67

The exception does not happen in Sirius Web after adding _If_ `aql:self != null`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/138227191-8b3103ae-feb2-4a90-adcf-fd23d2525e3a.png)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a Delete Tool for an object that deletes a referenced object while deleting the main object.
2. In the model in Sirius Web, add that element, but don't set the reference (so it is set to `null`)
3. Try to remove the main object

You can use my metamodel [CAL-web](https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/tree/fbc800a49c8218a6fa6142034e9a3a8020f68766/backend/model). It has 2 Delete Tools that cause NPEs. The workaround is adding `If` `aql:self != null` https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/commit/9f6d13747c44c2bcedc297e70a88b2d4647d68e0

### Expected behavior

The object is removed and there is no exception.

### Actual behavior

The first time I try to remove the element, it is not removed and there are logs from that NPE. The second time I try to delete it, the element gets removed.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/791/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Summary

When deleting referenced objects when deleting another object from the diagram using a _Delete Element_ tool with a _Remove_ operation, there is a `DanglingHREFException`

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a Delete Tool for an object that deletes a referenced object while deleting the main object.
2. In the model in Sirius Web, add that object and set the reference to another object
3. Try to remove the main object

You can use my [CAL](https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/tree/https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/tree/9f6d13747c44c2bcedc297e70a88b2d4647d68e0/backend/model/backend/model) metamodel. Create 2 application data pins, connect them together via a `DataFlow`, and then remove one of them. The `DataFlow` should be removed when removing the application data pin (unless https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/791 happens).

### Expected behavior

Both objects are removed and are no exceptions.

### Actual behavior

Both objects are removed and there is a `DanglingHREFException`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/792/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It used to be that moving any element on a diagram (in manual layout mode) would reset all (or at least most) edge to single segments with no bendpoints, even if the edge was between elements which were not moved at all.
The fix for https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/550 improved the situation, be we still reset the edges connected to a moved element to single segments, losing any previous routing information.

### Summary

When a containment reference is marked as `readonly` and not `changeable`, when trying to change the reference (in the child object properties, change the property that points to the parent) (`ComputedDataPin`'s `call` in this case), the input is not disabled, but trying to change it results in the following error:

> Invalid input type, ""EditSelectInput"" has been received while ""EditSelectInput"" was expected

### Screenshots

### Steps to reproduce

1. Mark a containment reference in the metamodel as `readonly` an uncheck `changeable`
2. Edit that property in Sirius Web

### Expected behavior

The input field for that property is `readonly` or `disabled`

### Actual behavior

The input field for that property can be changed in the UI, but changing it results in a toast message and an error in the server's logs:

### Summary

References that are marked as _Readonly_ in the model's Generation tab still can be changed in Sirius Web.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/140173125-09fe6a7d-6cb4-4c3d-adbc-e564395bb237.png)

Making the property not _changeable_ breaks the deserialization of the model, so it's not possible.

Probably related to https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/813

### Steps to reproduce

1. In the Generation tab in Sirius Desktop, mark a reference as readonly
2. Edit it in Sirius Web

### Expected behavior

The field is `readonly`/`disabled`.

### Actual behavior

The field is editable.

### Sirius Desktop compatibility

The property cannot be changed in Sirius Desktop's _Semantic_ tab:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/140173423-1ea9f322-f6f6-4525-bed2-ed2b7bfac38a.png)

But it can be changed in the _Main_ tab:

### Expected behavior

When a tool in the odesign file has dialog that lets the user perform an action with greater convenience, it would be great to also render the same dialog in Sirius Web.

My tool for creating a new node has a dialog inside

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/140173853-e743de2d-e1d2-4472-b5f7-a3c432d53854.png)

It works well in Sirius Desktop.

When trying to invoke that tool in Sirius Web, I get the following errors shown in the browser

> Invalid input type, ""InvokeNodeToolOnDiagramInput"" has been received while ""InvokeNodeToolOnDiagramInput"" was expected

Server logs show:

```sh
e.s.w.e.c.m.ModelOperationHandlerSwitch : The model operation DialogModelOperationImpl is not currently supported
```

### Cuttings backs

No clue what to write here.

### Potential side effects

The dialogs API seems quite robust, so supporting it can be tricky.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Alternatively, instead of using the dialogs from the odesign file, we could add dialogs by writing React components in the frontend application. They would not be metamodel-specific, though.

### Summary

Results of semantic model validation rules defined in the odesign file are not shown in Sirius Web.

I created a couple of semantic validation rules in the odesign file:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/140175207-ab120a1c-1247-4cef-82bb-08caee1de2a0.png)

When they are violated, the errors are shown in Sirius Desktop:

But the list of validations is empty in Sirius Web:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/140175289-4ab5fc89-99f4-4606-837a-2f33a383811c.png)

Even a semantic validation rule that is always aql:false is not shown in Sirius Web, and is always visible in Sirius Desktop.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a semantic validation rule in the odesign file
2. Make the rule fail in Sirius Web

### Expected behavior

There is a diagnostic shown for that semantic validation rule.

### Actual behavior

There are no messages from that semantic validation rule. It is as if the rule was not picked up by Sirius Web at all.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/816/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You can debug the code of the backend of Sirius Components by having it in your workspace with the backend of Sirius Web and launching all the server at once. For the frontend, we are relying on [Yalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc) to consume a locally built version of Sirius Components. We change Sirius Components, build it and publish it locally on Yalc and then refresh Sirius Web.

We could probably improve this workflow to run both parts of the frontend code at once but we did not have the time to explore such improvements for now.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc45Zf3c/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Expected behavior

Today, all diagram elements have a delete tool. This tool delete the element from the diagram and also from the model.
For a specific mapping, if a delete element tool has been defined in the odesign, then the behavior of the delete element tool is called instead of the generic delete. 

The goal is to have two generic delete tools: one for the graphical deletion (only on unsynchronized mappings) and one for the model deletion.
If a delete element tool has been defined in the odesign for a mapping, then the generic delete tools are not available anymore. Only the specific delete element tool is available.

From that, when you will need to provide the fan image using a regular Spring Controller, you can create / customize it programmatically.

Sirius Components allows that but Sirius Web does not offer the way to do it. In Sirius Web, we would need to allow specifiers to provide an image for the requested path (regardless of how the image is retrieved / created) in the `ImageController`. Right now, Sirius Web will only look for the image in the class path (`new ClassPathResource(imagePath)`) so Sirius Web expects that the image is a static resource.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc45objD/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Summary

I have added a new GraphQL mutation that programmatically creates specific model objects. The handler of that mutation uses `EditService` to create objects:

https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/blob/e07b62a15964b362b4d3805a9e76a1b5f3add7e8/backend/sirius-web-services/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/services/unitcalls/CreateUnitCallEventHandler.java#L130-L131

I can create those objects once without any issues:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/141338401-f8e891bc-a6bf-42f4-82d0-5049316d06aa.mp4

However, running the same mutation again results in the diagram being broken (there is a message ""The diagram does not exist"", but the model explorer tree is updated correctly - there is one new entry, as expected):

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/141340846-bd2a16e7-21d5-4a99-bd0a-e7d829175a92.mp4

There is also an exception in the console:

</details>

I suspect it has something to do with the pins (border nodes) appearing outside of the `UnitCall` (the white node). After moving the pins just slightly, the creation works mostly fine:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/141341113-e761225d-fcbc-40dd-932c-857c84b57982.mp4

But it is not very reliable. As you can see at the end of the video, the problem happened even though I moved the border nodes.

It would be nice if the exception did not happen. Perhaps I am doing something wrong in https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/blob/main/backend/sirius-web-services/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/services/unitcalls/CreateUnitCallEventHandler.java - let me know if that is the case and I can fix it on my end.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Add multiple objects programmatically (probably multiple times)

I know it may be hard to reproduce using a fresh instance of Sirius Web. You can use my fork (https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web) if you want - sending the following mutation multiple times in a row always reproduces the error (at least as far as I checked):

<details>

```graphql
mutation {
  createUnitCall(input: {
    	id: ""cfcce8ef-47e3-4f5e-9ecc-847deba46219"",
    	rootObjectId:""9e778a79-c5bb-484d-9867-86d4caddec18"",
      editingContextId: ""a7fdb460-e342-42a6-924e-d31cbb53db69"",
    unitRelease:{
      id: ""110f65c2-3fc6-411c-9ded-8c8cf96db52d"",
      name: ""Bounding Labels"",
      version: ""0.11"",
      pins: [
        {
          id: ""c915d7a5-dec5-4b60-9fdb-00eed6591cc4"",
          name:""Input"",
          binding:REQUIRED,
          tokenMultiplicity: SINGLE,
          dataMultiplicity: SINGLE
        },
        {
          id: ""76c05ac4-4b34-4053-97e5-8d65748d1485"",
          name:""Output"",
          binding: PROVIDED,
          tokenMultiplicity: SINGLE,
          dataMultiplicity: SINGLE
        }
      ]
    }
  }) {
    __typename
    ... on CreateUnitCallSuccessPayload {
      id
      createdUnitCall {
        id
        kind
        label
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to change the inputs:
* `rootObjectId` to the ID of the root object in the model (`ComputationApplicationRelease`)
* `editingContextId`

</details>

You can get the JAR from https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/actions/runs/1449876408. It is a drop-in replacement for the one from the https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web repository - it will use the same database credentials and will expose the same port.

### Expected behavior

Objects are created and shown on the diagram without any exceptions.

### Actual behavior

There is an exception and the diagram (and the model) stop being functional - the diagram cannot be displayed after that exception.

The only thing that helps to show the diagram again is removing all objects from the model and starting from scratch - so basically, the moment the exception happens, the model is no longer usable.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/828/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Expected behavior

I want to customize the `Workbench` component by adding new panels to it. I see it does not accept any props (it is suggested in https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/693), thus, the way for me to customize it would be to copy the code to my project and edit it manually. However, this can be problematic, because not all components are accessible to consumers of the library. [`index.ts`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/master/frontend/src/index.ts) exports a limited set of components. Accessing other components individually is not possible.

For example, if I wanted to reuse the `RightSite` component in the `Workbench` copied to my repository, I would like to do:

```ts
import { RightSite } from '@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/build/workbench/RightSite';
```

but, at the moment, the `build` directory bundles everything into `index.js` / `index.es.js`.

Thus would probably require modifying rollup's `output` configurations:

https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/0fa68a46463e41d17853ce3a04f614c0bd9bedec/frontend/rollup.config.js#L25-L35

[`output.preserveModules`](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#outputpreservemodules) looks like the option to use here, probably combined with [`output.entryFileNames`](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#outputentryfilenames) to use different extensions for ES and CJS modules.

### Cuttings backs

N/A

### Potential side effects

1. Consumers of the frontend package will need to watch out for breaking changes.
2. Consumers' bundler will do more work (depending on the approach - if the main `index.js` does not contain bundled code, but only exports other components)


### Describe alternatives you've considered

There is https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/693 already reported, but, in my view, exposing all components will be simpler and give more control to the consumers of the library.,

Material UI component names are not minified, which you can see on the screenshot. As a result, it is much easier to see the purpose of each component.

> Anyway, when developing I usually use `npm run build:dev` as it does not have this issue and is faster (to build).

I would be worried this assumes engineers working on Sirius Web forks are expected to work with a locally-built development build of `sirius-components` if they want to see component names.

---

The main point I wanted to make here is that this is not ideal for a components library (and IMO `sirius-components` is a component library, with `sirius-web` being a consumer of it) because it makes consuming it while developing an application based on Sirius Web more difficult.



In my view, an easy solution here would be adding `displayName` to publicly exposed React components (those that are exported in the main `index.ts`). This way the public API is well named. The internals can remain unnamed.

This is a minor issue for me and I can work around it. Being one of the first consumers of Sirius Web (or so I think, looking at the list of forks) I wanted to report issues with the development experience I am facing so we can improve it for everyone

CreateView have a ""variable name"" attribute.

The problem seems have deep impacts because the CreateView operations are all executed on diagram refresh and not in the CreateViewOperationHandler#handle method.

I have gotten to a point that I want to enable authentication and authorize users so they only see projects they own. I am using JWT-based authentication, but I don't think that should matter.

I have successfully added authentication to regular REST endpoints, as well as the GraphQL query/mutation endpoint (`/api/graphql`). I have trouble adding authentication to WebSocket connections (GraphQL subscriptions using the `/subscriptions`) endpoint.

So far I found that the `Authorization` header (or any other custom header, for that matter) is not passed when using WebSockets ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4361173/http-headers-in-websockets-client-api/41521871)). WebSocket authorization has to be done in other ways, usually through sending the authentication information in one of the initial messages.

This leads me to believe that authenticating WebSocket connections is at the moment not possible without modifications to `sirius-components`. To be concrete, from what I found I would either need to:

1. Register a `HandshakeInterceptor` for the `WebSocketHandlerRegistration` in https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/ab8097c6c3593f10fdd16f9212762624a3639ccc/backend/sirius-web-spring-graphql/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/spring/graphql/configuration/WebSocketConfiguration.java#L63-L64 and somehow set the `Principal` there. Some related StackOverflow questions on this
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28567146/how-to-set-a-principal-within-a-handshakeinterceptor
    * https://stackoverflow.com/a/27765688/4874344

    The problem here is that custom headers are not sent by browsers in WebSocket connections, so the HTTP connection itself will be void of any authentication data, so the interceptor won't be able to set anything. The authentication data would come in a subsequent WebSocket message, but that's already past the interceptor's job.

2. Extract the `Authorization` token from the payload sent in the `connection_init` initial WebSocket message, but that happens in `GraphQLWebSocketHandler`, which I believe I cannot modify from Sirius Web: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/ab8097c6c3593f10fdd16f9212762624a3639ccc/backend/sirius-web-spring-graphql/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/spring/graphql/ws/GraphQLWebSocketHandler.java#L243-L256

    This would seem like the most correct solution.

From what I could tell, in Sirius Web the WebSocket connections work fine due to [the `SiriusWebAuthenticationFilter`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/backend/sirius-web-sample-application/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/sample/filters/SiriusWebAuthenticationFilter.java), which appends `Authorization` headers to **all** requests (both regular HTTP API requests **and** WebSocket connections). This seems like a hack that hides the fact that WebSocket requests **cannot** have such headers because browsers just don't send them ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4361173/http-headers-in-websockets-client-api/41521871)). I expect that if we removed `SiriusWebAuthenticationFilter` and instead attached the `Authorization` header to all API requests, the problem with WebSocket connections missing authentication information would be surfaced.

If it is possible at the moment to authenticate WebSocket connections and I have missed something, let me know. If not, I would appreciate making the changes to allow passing authentication data to those connections

My authentication-related work is generally described https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/issues/96 (see https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/issues/96#issuecomment-980572837 for a description of the problem) and implemented so far in https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/pull/97.

GraphQL queries and mutations now correctly expect the header to be sent via the frontend and result in 401 errors if the header is not present. GraphQL subscriptions seem to work without any headers. This is not what I observed on https://github.com/Gelio/CAL-web/pull/97 where I was getting `connection_error` responses via WebSocket:

The workaround is to always supply the `Authorization` `principal` for the `/subscriptions` GraphQL endpoint.

This is flawed because there is no authentication/authorization for that endpoint and anyone can get read-only access to any model via GraphQL subscriptions.

This makes my priority for fixing this issue lower, but I would still like to have JWT authentication enabled for GraphQL subscriptions too.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc46efsO/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

> This leads me to believe that authenticating WebSocket connections is at the moment not possible without modifications to sirius-components. 

There are a couple of proprietary product which integrate the GraphQLWebSocketHandler with an authentication system without issues. Since they are proprietary solutions, I cannot share their code source but here are a couple comments.

> From what I could tell, in Sirius Web the WebSocket connections work fine due to the SiriusWebAuthenticationFilter, which appends Authorization headers to all requests (both regular HTTP API requests and WebSocket connections). This seems like a hack that hides the fact that WebSocket requests cannot have such headers because browsers just don't send them (source).

The GraphQL API over WebSocket works in Sirius Web only because of the SiriusWebAuthenticationFilter (overwise it would fail since we wouldn't have any principal as you have noticed). This class is a big hack that I have created quite quickly to solve this simple issue.

Sirius Components needs to be Spring Security aware and it needs to manipulate Principal instances at some locations. Honestly, I'm quite convinced that we could even remove that requirement entirely and it would be a great improvement. Yet at the same time, Sirius Web will not try to cover the topic of authentication and authorization. My goal was to quickly to have an Authentication instance in all use cases without having to think about it. I haven't found the time to go back and look at this old hack to see how I could improve it or even remove it entirely to replace it with a more simple Spring Security configuration.

Since Sirius Components will need a Principal, we have made it a requirement at the very top of the GraphQLWebSocketHandler instead of discovering that something is missing deep down below (it also comes from the fact that we used to do stuff with this principal there but that part of the code has been removed since it was useless anyway).

That being said, the core part of your question remain, how is this principal given to the WebSocket connection to work with the current user afterwards? As I said, I can't share proprietary code here but in some projects that I have manipulated that is just plainly handled by Spring Security itself. There's no magic, there's nothing special.

https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.7.RELEASE/reference/html/websocket.html#websocket-authentication

> 24.2 WebSocket Authentication
> WebSockets reuse the same authentication information that is found in the HTTP request when the WebSocket connection was made. This means that the Principal on the HttpServletRequest will be handed off to WebSockets. If you are using Spring Security, the Principal on the HttpServletRequest is overridden automatically.
> 
> More concretely, to ensure a user has authenticated to your WebSocket application, all that is necessary is to ensure that you setup Spring Security to authenticate your HTTP based web application.

You just need to properly setup Spring Security.

To conclude, we have created our own integration of GraphQL Java in Spring at a time when mature and popular solutions did not exist in the Spring / GraphQL community. Our solution comes with both the GraphQLWebSocketHandler and the GraphQLController as the two entry points (WebSocket and HTTP respectively).

We now have popular solutions such as [Netflix DGS](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/) or even the official [Spring GraphQL](https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql) project for example (which seems to converge with [Netflix DGS which may reuse Spring GraphQL](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-framework/tree/spring-graphql-integration/graphql-dgs-spring-graphql-bridge)). We may completely remove both entry points and all of our custom GraphQL integration in favor of a standard solution like that in the future. We just did not have the time for that over the past few months. We have no interest in maintaining a custom GraphQL / Spring framework for our project which is why the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/54f3ae3e461c9291db3bfbf093d46a97cd52415f/CHANGELOG.adoc#deprecation-warning-1) of the v0.5.0 had some deprecation warning for our GraphQL integration.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc46oaJB/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

> You just need to properly setup Spring Security.

I believe I did that. All my regular HTTP requests for GraphQL queries and mutations are authenticated correctly, because I am able to pass the authentication token in the HTTP connection headers, which is safe. For WebSockets, there is no way that I know of to provide custom headers.

A way to circumvent that would be to pass the token in as a query parameter to the `/subscriptions` endpoint (e.g. `/subscriptions?token=...`) and then extract it in a security filter. This is not great, though, because many servers/proxies print the whole URLs in their logs, which means auth tokens would be stored in the logs.

As far as I have researched the problem of authenticating GraphQL subscriptions ([here](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-servlet/discussions/134#discussioncomment-225970), [here](https://betterprogramming.pub/understand-graphql-subscriptions-in-java-with-a-tic-tac-toe-game-832ba2729e6d#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20way%20to%20handle%20a%20subscription%20authentication%20is%20using%20the%20payload%20transmitted%20with%20the%20GQL_CONNECTION_INIT%20message.), and [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-subscriptions/authentication/)), the standard way is to provide the token using the [`connectionParams`](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/a8bbabfe375090b44d4a8bd028356ec53d48a23a/src/client.ts#L62) of Apollo WebSocket Link, which includes the token in the `connection_init` message, which is the first to be sent to `/subscriptions`. Then, the server should unwrap that message, and as I see, some Java GraphQL solutions allow registering custom interceptors that get access to those `connectionParams` and are able to set the principal in Spring Security context (like [this one](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/samples/blob/e0918ce7f15599c1040a35d6e9b9c2f1a1584e0a/subscription-with-authentication/src/main/java/subscription/AuthenticationConnectionListener.java)).

I find this last piece to be missing in the proprietary GraphQL server that is implemented in `sirius-components`.

If I understand correctly, you're saying that you're going to focus on removing the proprietary implementation of a GraphQL server that `sirius-components` has, and instead use a ready-made solution like Netflix DGS or Spring GraphQL. If that allows registering custom interceptors that could intercept the token from `connectionParams` - great. Until that is done, however, I don't see a way to authenticate GraphQL subscriptions in `sirius-components` that does not involve providing the token in the query parameters.

As a workaround, I suppose `sirius-components` could allow registering a custom service that would be invoked with the contents of the `connection_init` message, and could set the necessary principal in Spring Security context based on the `connectionParams`. It could be invoked next to https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/ab8097c6c3593f10fdd16f9212762624a3639ccc/backend/sirius-web-spring-graphql/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/spring/graphql/ws/GraphQLWebSocketHandler.java#L255-L256

That requires a brief refactor of that `handleTextMessage` method, though. I understand it may not seem worth it given the fact you're planning on removing this code anyway. From my side, that seems like the only safe solution to authenticate GraphQL subscriptions given the current stack.

Let me know if there is a solution I am not seeing. I understand you cannot share the source code. I would appreciate even a brief description of the idea.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc46rQ9W/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Honestly everything is in the Spring Security documentation link that I have provided. If the security of the HTTP layer is properly done and if it requires some authentication, then this authentication is provided for the WebSocket layer by the HTTP handshake request of the WebSocket connection.

Sadly, I did not find any concrete answer to this that would not involve intercepting the `connection_init` message, which I don't think is possible with the existing GraphQL implementation in Sirius Components.

When trying to enable authentication in Sirius Web I noticed the SQL queries used by the `IProjectRepository` do not restrict access to projects based on the `username`

https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/4b91a66492ea1302c222a24c069389a4a207aede/backend/sirius-web-persistence/src/main/resources/db/sirius-web-named-queries.properties#L1-L4

I understand Sirius Web is using a single hardcoded `system` user at the moment, so the username does not matter. On the other hand, there seems to be no harm in verifying the username in the queries, because the `system` account is still created, so all queries should return the same results regardless of whether they check the username or not.

Having the username be verified in those SQL queries by default would mean there are fewer changes needed to enable authentication for anyone wanting to develop their own modeler based on Sirius Web.

The code in question has been contributed to Sirius Web quite recently (in August) when we moved all those projects from Sirius Components to Sirius Web:

- sirius-web-persistence
- sirius-web-services-api
- sirius-web-services
- sirius-web-graphql-schema
- sirius-web-graphql
- sirius-web-spring

While those projects were in Sirius Components, their goal was to provide everything to support applications built on top of Sirius Components. We quickly realized that Sirius Components was being used in applications with very different lifecycles and architectures. As a result, we made some massive changes to Sirius Components to reduce its scope to focus it around representation management. This is why we have removed from Sirius Components any persistence related code or most of our GraphQL specific code too. As a result, you can now more easily reuse Sirius Components with the database you want or the GraphQL framework of your choice.

When we have started all those projects (when it was closed source), there weren't a ton of good solutions to integrate GraphQL Java with Spring for example, so we came up with our own solution which we are in the process of removing piece by piece. We have removed the data fetchers and type providers from Sirius Components, pretty much everything in `sirius-web-graphql-utils` will be removed soon. In order to let consumers used solutions such as Netflix DGS if they want to.

We have also removed a lot of the complexity from those projects in order to stop trying to support all those different use cases since there are so many of them. Sirius Web is a simple web application showing Sirius Components in action. The goal of Sirius Web is not to be an enterprise ready application to be deployed on the cloud for anyone to use. As such, we do not try to provide authentication or authorization support. We tried in the past in Sirius Components and we had so many different authentication strategies used by some of our users that we just stopped trying to support everything and instead gave them more freedom to just do what they want. Another issue related to that was our strategy to persist account information. Some of our users wanted to have a different database schema of even a remote service to retrieve said account informations etc. You can still find some remnants of this code here and there in Sirius Web such as this username argument in the `IProjectRepository` but those are parts of the code that should have been removed.

Sirius Web is not a web application on top of which every application trying to integrate Sirius Components should be built (We tried that when the code was in Sirius Components).

Sirius Web is meant to be a simple web application integrating Sirius Components to show:

- what Sirius Components can do since most of the core behavior is in Sirius Components
- how to build your own web application on top of Sirius Components

It is meant to be used as is to manipulate Sirius Components as an end user or It is meant to be forked, heavily modified as you which, change the database schema, add anything you like, plug the authentication / authorization strategy that you need etc if you want to build a more advanced version of Sirius Web. We will not try to restrict access by username, we will instead remove even more of those remnants of code which can still be found here and there but for your use case, you can do as you please, change anything you want in your fork.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5WnlGZ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

- [x] Handle dot style for bordered nodes (supported with the same technique as in the core, i.e. set a rectangle node with a large enough border radius)
- [ ] ~~Add support for computed icon URL on labels~~: abandoned (for this version)
- [ ] ~~Add support for tool sections (with label and icon), and generally better control on which tools are available where in the palette~~: abandoned (for this version)
- [ ] ~~Add support for (configurable) icons on tools~~: abandoned (for this version)
- [ ] ~~Add support for configuring recursive structures (reuse/reference of node descriptions): this may require changes in the core~~: abandoned (for this version)
- ~~Add support for configuring drop tools~~: implemented as part of #884

### Actual behavior

This is used to support migration participants by post-processing the recorded information.

Sirius Components does not setup these options. The result is that some `odesign` files which, while technically invalid, work perfectly fine in Sirius Desktop, cause an exception when loaded in Sirius Components, and are thus unusable. For example:

> Caused by: org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.FeatureNotFoundException: Feature 'initialOperation' not found. (example.odesign, 1239, 33)

While we do not plan to support the migration mechanism in Sirius Components, we could probably be a little more flexible here by setting the proper EMF options. Of course we may want to log a message in the cases where the loaded odesign was technically invalid.

### Screenshots

Some of my style customizations in the odesign file use AQL. An example style customization:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/144719096-24eef6b4-472f-4c76-b76c-48ac6098c54c.png)

`getDataPinIconPath` is defined in my metamodel's `Services`.

It works well in Sirius Desktop:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889383/144719112-3b3c1a25-006e-46b7-9113-5b22c0daa577.png)

But there are no images shown in Sirius Web:

The image path that Sirius Web wants to load is:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/images/eu.balticlsc.model.CAL.edit/icons/computed-data-pin/'%20+%20self.declared.getDataPinIconPath()
```

whereas it should be:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/images/eu.balticlsc.model.CAL.edit/icons/computed-data-pin/single-data-single-token.png
```

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a metamodel style customization using AQL for the `workspacePath` of an image of a node

### Expected behavior

The image is loaded correctly using the same logic as in Sirius Desktop.

### Actual behavior

The image is not loaded due to a malformed URL.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/865/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Screenshots

Sirius Desktop automatically generated icons for each object in the metamodel. They are in the `.edit` package, in the `icons/full/obj16` directory. I have modified those icons. They are correctly shown in the model tree in Sirius Desktop:

For more complex cases, studio makers have to rely either on our Java APIs and/or to our Sirius Desktop compatibility layer, creating their Ecore-based metamodel and odesign configuration files from e.g. Obeo Designer and then importing them into Sirius Web.

It should be possible to create non-trivial modeling studios without using Sirius Desktop at all.
The studio maker should be able to define as much as possible of his/her studio without leaving his/her browser. For the more complex cases where that is not possible (e.g. to call complex operations which only make sense to define in Java), there should be a (documented) way to do this without using the Eclipse EMF tooling or Sirius Desktop / Obeo Designer (it's OK to use the Eclipse-based STS for example, but it should work with other tools).

This issue will be refined in more specific tickets as needed, for example #851, to add the features and fix the bugs which prevent the goal to be achieved.

Examples of studios that it should be possible to define: 
* component diagrams similar (but simpler of course) to what it available in Capella
* entity diagrams similar to the ones in [IS Designer](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/InformationSystem)
* state machine diagrams

Currently, When performing any manual layout, the backend service will calculate every element to the wanted status like size and position. and send it to the user. which makes many unexpected issues(see below cases). and lead to a bad experience.

## Case1
### Steps to reproduce
Moving a node with a labeled edge 
### Expected behavior
The edge label change to the right position on the fly.
### Actual behavior
The edge label had an inconsistent position between moving and finished.


## Case2
### Steps to reproduce
Moving a node frequently.
### Expected behavior
The node moves to the mouse release position without further changes.
### Actual behavior
After finishing the consecutive move actions, the node will continue to move. Which is demanded by the incremental layout service.

## What's the incremental layout logic I expected:

The incremental layout should only record which diagram element has changed then the backend saved the changes. No calculation should be performed. As though the user is patching changes and the backend service is recording.

In Sirius Desktop, we had lot of difficulties coming from the fact that the diagram engine did not control every parts of the diagram rendering especially the size / position of the nodes. In Sirius Components, the backend is in charge of those properties and the size / position of the diagram in the `DiagramEventProcessor` is the sole source of truth regarding the full layout of a diagram while it is being edited. This has been done on purpose based on our experience in Sirius Desktop and I don't see us change from that approach to something with a frontend computed layout in the foreseeable future because it makes some use cases almost impossible to handle. We even started Sirius Web (before it was open sourced) with some frontend computed layout and moved it all to the backend.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc467e90/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, in SVG the `rx` attribute [*can* be a percentage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/rx#rect), but in our case `RectangularNodeStyle.getBorderRadius()` is an `int` which we always convert as a plain length.

I guess we could embrace the fact that we will render as SVGs, make `RectangularNodeStyle.getBorderRadius()` a string and return `""100%""` in this case. Which would offer more flexibility to programatically defined modelers to chose between absolute lengths and percentage. Or add a ""hack"" to interpret negative values as percentage in `RectangleView.tsx` and return `-100` here.

### Steps to reproduce

In the screenshot above, trying to reduce the size of the ""New Component"" node from the right border (in the direction of the red arrow) does not work. It is blocked by the presence of the border node, which is considered ""inside"" and enforces a minimum size (which is the correct/expected behavior for actual children nodes).

Note that of course the same behavior occurs for all the sides as soon as they have at least one border node on them.
In  the extreme case, a node which has border nodes on all sides can not be made smaller from any direction (expect by moving some border nodes elsewhere, doing the resize and then resetting them).

### Expected behavior

The presence of border nodes should not block the resizing.

This is a little extreme to make the problems obvious, but when using a large border width on a node:

1. the resize handlers appear ""inside"" the element, when they are supposed to be attached to the selection outline.
2. the starting and ending points of the edges also appear in the inside
3. depending on the font size and border size, the label can overlap with the border

The issues are present even when using pretty normal border widths, but of course are less obivous there.

- Create a custom service class with a flux
- Use it in a listener while loading the EditingContext using the IEditingContextSearchService to react to an event and send a payload
- Leverage it from a Subscription datafetcher (included but not limited to a SubscriptionEditingContextEventDataFetcher like in Sirius Web)

The service class could be as simple as this:

```
@Service
public class EditingContextFlux {

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open a model that has border nodes

### Expected behavior

Border nodes appear on the edge of their container, just like in Sirius Desktop



### Actual behavior

Border nodes appear inside of their container, not making them _border_ nodes anymore.

I thought https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/359 was supposed to fix it, but it seems I was wrong.

Sprotty's SPorts are not SNodes. It's a different type of element, which in particular does not have children. It seems designed more as ""anchor points"" for incoming/outgoing edges, but in Sirius border nodes have all the capabilities of other nodes (they can have their own children, and even their own border nodes). The only thing that makes them special is that their location is constrained to the (rectangular) bounding box of their parent.

Sprotty's type hierarchy seems to match [ELK's metamodel](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation/tooldevelopers/graphdatastructure.html#graph-data-structure):
* `SConnectableElement` <-> `ElkConnectableShape`
* `SNode extends SConnectableElement` <-> `ElkNode extends ElkConnectableShape`
* `SPort extends SConnectableElement` <-> `ElkPort extends ElkConnectableShape`

ELK has the same limitation.

So it seems there are two options:
1. Use the `SPort` mechanism anyway, and accept that Sirius Components will only support a subset of what Sirius border nodes can do (granted, it's the most common use case, but our APIs are more generic than that: ` {oes}.components.diagrams.Node.getBorderNodes()` is a generic `List<Node>`, which can themselves have children & border nodes). It might not be that simple as `SNode` does not extend `SPort` (so, code duplication or dynamic type checks to handle both cases with the same code).
2. Continue to use `SNode` to represent border nodes, but make the code (frontend, ELK, incremental layout) aware that their position is constrained compared to plain child nodes (e.g. extending [SiriusDragAndDropMouseListener#getValidPosition()](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/d9f07a2202c34735e76eaffa3d4731d2a10d89fe/frontend/src/diagram/sprotty/siriusDragAndDropMouseListener.ts#L107) for the front-end/interactive move part).

I wonder if it's worth trying to support border nodes as nodes. We could simply convert border nodes to `ElkPort` on the backend and `SPort` on the frontend and while the diagram API could theoretically support border nodes with border nodes or child nodes, in practice it would not be supported for now.

Technically the Sirius Desktop support for sequence diagrams is almost entirely based on that capacity (lifelines are border nodes of the participant nodes, and all executions on a lifeline are border nodes of the lifeline or of their parent execution). But that is a very special case.

I don't have other concrete examples, so I guess we can decide to only support the common case.

There's still the issue that SPorts are not SNode, so going this route, while being more in line with how Sprotty and ELK work, may require some duplication or refactorings to get the same behaviors we have on nodes available on ports (styling, tool application, direct edit, etc.). We'll see when I start concretely (soon).

Already started on that, but currently stuck with `GraphFactory` creating plain Nodes for my BorderNodes/Ports. I'm not very familiar with the part of Sprotty, but I'm investigating. I'll keep updating here with what I find.

Note that one limitation of `SPort` is that they can not have children, which (from what I understand) means no labels. Not supporting the complex ""border nodes on border nodes with nodes inside them"" case is OK, but not supporting labels not so much. Sure it's probably possible to add it, but not sure how much work that would involve.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc49VmvT/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It's possible for the calls to `refresh` to return an `Optional.empty()` (for example if the diagram points to a diagram description which does not exist anymore). In this case we blindly pass `null` to `DiagramContext.update()`, which throws an NPE in this case.

I'm not sure what's the proper fix is.

The domains are presented using their technical ids (nsURI), which is not very user-friendly (to say the least).
This is made worse by the pseudo-random names used currently for dynamic domains, which are completely unrelated to what is actually inside the domain.

The primary name exposed to end-users for domains should be a human-readable one.
For statically registered EMF domains, we could improve the way we register them.

Instead of:
```java
@Configuration
public class SampleEMFConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public EPackage flowEPackage() {
        return FlowPackage.eINSTANCE;
    }

we could allow for registering richer domain definitions as consitent whole (instead of separate pacakge/adapter-factory/etc.

Something like:

```java
@Configuration
public class SampleConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public DomainDefinition flowDomain() {
        return DomainDefinition.newEMFBasedDomain(""Flow"") // a user-friendly name

* [x] **I have checked that this bug appears on Chrome**
* [x] **I have specified the version** : 2021.12.12
* [x] **I have specified my environment** : Linux

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add precondition expression containing `self` variable for a representation specification in odesign-file
2. Try to create the representation

### Expected behavior

The representation kind is available in the new representation dialog and successfully created.

### Actual behavior

The representation kind is not available in the new representation dialog. The following exception is raised: ""An error has occurred with the expression 'aql:self.getModelKindMnemonic() = 'EventDrivenProcessChain'': Couldn't find the 'self' variable""

### Details

Class `org.eclipse.sirius.web.emf.handlers.EditingContextRepresentationDescriptionsEventHandler` contains the following code:
```
VariableManager variableManager = new VariableManager();
variableManager.put(IRepresentationDescription.CLASS, optionalClazz.get());
Predicate<VariableManager> canCreatePredicate = description.getCanCreatePredicate();
boolean canCreate = canCreatePredicate.test(variableManager);
```
Only `class` variable is added.

I guess the problem is that `org.eclipse.sirius.web.spring.collaborative.dto.EditingContextRepresentationDescriptionsInput` has only a `kind` parameter. The selected object is not even send in a GraphQL query.

However property forms support preconditions with `self` variable. `org.eclipse.sirius.web.spring.collaborative.forms.dto.PropertiesEventInput` has `objectId` parameter instead of `kind`.

Maybe behaviour for representations should be aligned with the behaviour for forms? Both of them should support `self` in preconditions?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1014/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Expected behavior

1. Sirius Components are localizable
2. Doesn't contain duplicated strings
3. Supports plurals for strings

### Cuttings backs

No.

### Potential side effects

No.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

There are several localization frameworks, but https://react.i18next.com/ seems to be optimal.

### Some notes

1. At first I tried to create separate localization files for each React component, but it's very unhandy. Because there are a lot of files, it's hard to find them, to edit them. Much easier to have one localization file per-module.

2. You can use any string as a key in localization file. For instance ""Arrange all elements"". But I guess that it's better to have short keys in camelCase, for instance just ""arrangeAll"".

3. I think it's a good idea to unify keys. For instance here is a fragment for project creation form:

```
{
  ""siriusWebApplication"": {
    ""project"": {
      ""create"": {
        ""title"": ""Create a new project"",
        ""description"": ""Get started by creating a new project"",
        ""name"": {
          ""label"": ""Name"",
          ""placeholder"": ""Enter the project name"",
          ""helperText"": ""The name must contain between 3 and 1024 characters""
        },
        ""submit"": ""Create""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `siriusWebApplication` is a name of module
  - `project` is a name of entity
    - `create` is a name of action for that entity
      - `title`  is a form title
      - `description`  is a form description
      - `name` is a name of an entity attribute
        - `label` is a field label for the attribute
        - `placeholder` is a placeholder for the field
        - `helperText` is a helper text for the field
      - `submit` is a name of submit button
      - `cancel` is a name of cancel button
      - `close` is a name of close button

I find this template very useful, it allows to unify form localization.

4. Some of the strings are duplicated now, for instance, `rename`, `delete`, ... Probably they can be moved to some common section. But I guess it will complicate localization, maybe I'm wrong.

5. If you don't want to bother with ru locale, I can remove it and add on the application level. But maybe it will be useful for someone","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1028/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open an existing (non-empty) diagram
2. Open the browser devtools and make sure the console is visible
3. Refresh the browser page, and immediatly after, click on a node in the diagram

The contextual palette opens as expected (and everything seems to work fine), but we get a React warning in the console:

```
index.js:1 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique ""key"" prop.

Check the render method of `ContextualPalette`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.

This works fine for relatively simple diagram descriptions, but does not scale well for more complex ones.
For example for a diagram with, say 20 different kinds of nodes which can all contain each other with no depth limit, [the GraphQL query](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/pull/960/commits/e3a37e883cb7ab5c3712c190926cd06e5e9f54f9#diff-3c6a2180a0b55ca6fdeaec04c280c9df0239a1d7ffd15ed7523019c9b7b69fd8R363) to retrieve the diagram description's structure, even if it is limited to a depth of 4, will return at least 20×20×20×20 = 160000 elements! With 30 different kinds of node, 30^4 = 810000, etc.

Note that the changes planned for https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/779 may indirectly solve this by replacing this whole static query with on-demand queries about the tools and properties of a node only when it is selected, which will not be recursive.

### Steps to reproduce

- I have two root nodes, A { size: 200x300, position: 10;10 } (in blue) and B { size: 200x300, position: 500;500} (in orange)
- I click on (100;100) (inside A, red dot) and send a creation event
- The editing context actually creates the new node in B

### Expected behavior

- A { size: 200x300, position: 10;10 } 
- B { size: 200x300, position: 500;500 } 
- Child { size: 150x70, position: 510;510 } 

A is not resized. B is not resized either, since it is big enough to contain the new node. The new node is created in B, since it is a son of B.

### Actual behavior

- A { size: 200x300, position: 10;10  } 
- B { size: 600x700, position: 231;231 } 
- Child { size: 150x70, position: 231;231 } 

A is not resized. The new node is created in B...but not at the right coordinates, which forces B to be resized

 } 
```

### Expected behavior

Only one runnable is created, computing the first queryBasedObjects along with its sub requests.

### Actual behavior

### Current behavior

Both nodes and border nodes are considered as node.

Currently the the two types of label positioning are
* label:inside-center: the label is inside the node. It is centered horizontally and on top vertically
* label:outside-center: the label is outside and right above the node. It centered horizontally.

cd `org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.components.NodeComponent.doRender(VariableManager, String, Optional<Node>)`

LabelType nodeLabelType = LabelType.INSIDE_CENTER;
if (NodeType.NODE_IMAGE.equals(type)) {
    nodeLabelType = LabelType.OUTSIDE_CENTER;

The label may overlap its node whatever its type. So the *node size does not depends on its label*

The label for the border node must support both `label:inside-center` and `label:outside-center` types
The behavior is the same than nodes's.

The padding and margin are those used for ELK layout 

ELK layout must have the same behavior than the incremental layout

If Bob and Alice are working on a diagram. Bob creates an element then Alice creates a new reference to this element. Bob wants to undo the last change, what is undone? His change or Alice change? What if there are 5 persons working on the diagram and new changes are coming very quickly so while Bob wants to undo something others are adding new changes again and again? Since they are working on the same project, now let's consider that they are both manipulating the same data but using different diagrams for example.

While it may not be an issue for most use cases, it prevents us from having the ability to distinguish how a representation description has been created.

Without this ability, we can't know in a stateless manner which part of the code should be in charge of supporting a feature for a given representation description id (the view support, the compatibility layer or a regular programmatic API). For example, we could easily encode the origin of the representation description in the identifier while still keeping a relatively opaque identifier.

#### Compatibility layer

In the compatibility layer, we could thus encode the odesign and the representation description used. Something like this `siriusRcp://ODESIGN#REPRESENTATION_DESCRIPTION`. Using this approach, we would produce identifiers such as `siriusRcp://b0d9929d-10a4-4e5c-9020-fd85412b6070#7638d850-52e0-4c14-8290-83a2d11c9509`. Currently, only the last part of the identifier is used as the identifier `7638d850-52e0-4c14-8290-83a2d11c9509` in our example.


#### View

In a similar fashion, we could encode the origin of the representation description from the view DSL with something like `view://RESOURCE#REPRESENTATION_DESCRIPTION`. This would produce a fairly similar identifier as the previous one with things like `view://b0d9929d-10a4-4e5c-9020-fd85412b6070#7638d850-52e0-4c14-8290-83a2d11c9509`. In an application like Sirius Web, it would give us quite easily the identifier of the document which contains the representation description. It would thus remove the need to look everywhere in every projects to find where a representation description is coming from.

Anything else would be used for representation descriptions created programmatically","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1088/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

To calculate edge IDs we are using the edge description id, the source id, the target id, and the index of the edge in its container, which is the diagram itself.

Starting from a diagram without any edge. If we create an edge its index will be _0_ and will give `id = a`. If we create another edge the renderer could consider the new edge has the index equals to _0_ which gives `id = b`. The renderer will consider the existing edge index will be _1_ which gives `id = c`, and thus, the renderer will not be able to retrieve layout data from the existing edge which has been stored with `id = a`. This is a problem since we are using IDs to retrieve layout data of existing element to let the layout engine computes the layout from the rendered diagram.

So, after the second render the layout engine will consider that both edges are new and use data to create the second edge to also create the first edge ""again"", which gives the _Actual behavior_.

I want to edit bpmn2 diagrams in sirius-web. After a small effort, I displayed your Travel Agency sample bpmn2 diagram pretty well. But I have 2 problems:
1- in the details pane, attribute labels are blank
2- in the context menu for actions, majority of actions are not available, so new objects can be created with the treeviewer only

I ' ve attached the screen capture below about those problems.
For the first problem I have tried to add ILabelFeatureProvider Bpmn2LabelFeatureProvider() bean into SampleEMFConfiguration, but nothing happened. I think those beans are for objects (i.e. displayed as boxes or arrows) instead of attributes.

Can you provide some hints for how I can overcome those problems?

For that, we want to stop using the `<Accordion />` component from MaterialUI and instead use a vertical bar which will display the icons of the various views to display. When the user will click on one of those icons, the selected view should be displayed.

On a `<Site />` located on the right, the vertical bar should be located on the right and on the left for a `<Site />` located on the left. Each view should thus come with an icon (from MaterialUI) in order to identify the view in the vertical bar.

This change should not involve any change on the backend. The only difference in behavior will come from the fact that the views which are not displayed will be unmounted and as such they won't subscribe to the relevant subscription. This will help lower the CPU and Memory footprint of the `<Workbench />`.

Should it be a new kind of structuring construct like pages and groups? Some kind of ""composite widget""?

Currently we have `Properties` > `Page` (one per selection entry, organized in tabs) > `Group` (in general we have a single ""Core Properties"" one) > `XXXPropertySection` (one per widget).

To limit the impacts one option would be to extend `Group` with a new attribute, say `displayMode`:

```
export interface Group {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  displayMode: GroupDisplayMode;
  widgets: Widget[];
}

export type GroupDisplayMode = 'LIST | 'TOGGLEABLE_AREAS';
```

It's trivial (and can be made without breaking compat) on the backend, and on the front only [`Group`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/master/frontend/src/properties/Group.tsx#L57) would need to change with something like:

```js
if (group.displayMode === 'TOGGLEABLE_AREAS') {
    return <ToggleableAreas title={group.label} widgets={propertySections}/>;
} else {
  // do as before (plain divs)
}
```

So,
-  It is sufficient that you can load the images in folder once, i.e., no need to use  [CustomImagesLoader](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/backend/sirius-web-sample-application/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/sample/configuration/CustomImagesLoader.java) by setting the system property in **each** app start.
- After a while, you may want to change the resources and want not-to-use the old images. In that case, I think that you may purge the unwanted images from the `customimage` table.

### Expected behavior

Based on, https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1149 (new FormDescription in View DSL), it will be possible to open a WYSIWYG editor on FormDescription model elements.
In the editor, users (specifiers) would drag & drop widgets from a list of widgets to create the future form representations.
Widgets placed in the editor would have the values and styles defined in the details view.
The placement/layout of the widgets in the editor would follow the order defined in the explorer view.

### Expected behavior

Based on https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1149 (new FormDescription in View DSL), it will be possible to open a WYSIWYG editor on FormDescription model elements.
In the editor, users (specifiers) would drag & drop widgets from a list of widgets to create the future form representations.
Widgets placed in the editor would have the values and styles defined in the details view.
The placement/layout of the widgets in the editor would follow the order defined in the explorer view.

I want to use Node Tool in Sirius Web. I downloaded current sample app jar, and created new schema, then followed the Stickies example demonstrated in Melanie' s youtube video.  Lastly, I created Node Tool for Member domain object. I have attached the image for the definitions. When trying the tool a blank gray toaster displayed and no message displayed in the application console. I think I am missing some point, but I could' t figure out. If I could be successful then I will try create a composition of objects in a single action. 
Many thanks in advance for your interest.

In the View DSL, it is now possible to create form descriptions, in addition to diagram descriptions.
A form description contains a set of widgets (textfields, checkboxes, radio buttons...).
We would like to be able to add styles and conditional styles on those widgets, the same way it is done for nodes and edges on diagram descriptions.
The style of a widget would allow to customize the background/foreground color, font style, ... depending on the widget.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new project
2. Add a ""Robot Flow"" and a ""View""
3. In the view, create a diagram description and a node description
4. Expand elements in the explorer so that both the node style and some (any) element of the Robot flow are visible.
5. Select a semantic element from the Robot, and Ctrl-click on the node style to *add* it to the selection => :boom:

`NodeStylePropertiesConfigurer` which only tests for the type of the first element in the selection in its `canCreatePagePredicate`. If the first element is a NodeStyle, the page will be instanciated, and then its `semanticElementsProvider` will be invoked for every element oin the selection, but that provider assumes *every* element in the selection is a NodeStyle (there used to be only one, so that was always the case if `canCreatePagePredicate` had returned `true` earlier. This explains the second crash above.

The first stack is unrelated to multi-selection, but caused by https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1033 not having created the `_UI_BorderStyle_borderColor_feature` key (and probably others) when regenerating the metamodel. It is not visible in ""normal"" usage as `NodeStylePropertiesConfigurer` does not use this to create the label for the ""Border Color"" attribute's widget.

However since the first element in the selection is an element from Flow, `NodeStylePropertiesConfigurer`'s `canCreatePagePredicate` return false, which triggers the use of the default generic/reflective rules, which use EMF's item providers.

Another related issue seen while analysing this: even after fixing the invalid `semanticElementsProvider`, there is an incorrect behavior when selecting first a NodeStyle and then a Flow element. Because the first selection element returns a non-empty form, the use of the default provider for the other elements in the selection where it may apply is completelyn bypassed in `PropertiesEventProcessorFactory.createRepresentationEventProcessor()`:

```java
Optional<FormDescription> optionalFormDescription = Optional.empty();
if (!formDescriptions.isEmpty()) {
    optionalFormDescription = new FormDescriptionAggregator().aggregate(formDescriptions, objects, this.objectService);
}
FormDescription formDescription = optionalFormDescription.orElse(this.propertiesDefaultDescriptionProvider.getFormDescription());
```

Here `FormDescriptionAggregator` finds at least one match (the custom page for the NodeStyle), so it does not try to apply the default rules for the other parts of the selection.

I'm trying to find out if Sirius-web is mature enough to use for a few of our models. 

An example EMF model is shown below, where the `InPort` and `OutPort` classes are used as bordered nodes on the `Model` node.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2264267/170002889-24b4af9f-e749-4975-a76f-a47624911fbd.png)

In Eclipse-Sirius this is visualized as follows: (with an example model instance):

When trying to deploy this in Sirius web, the `Port`s are not shown and the log says when trying to create border nodes:
`The representation with the id 00d9eef6-0961-35c4-a7eb-535e87620512 does not exist`

Any idea how to solve this? Are bordered nodes supported at all?

Border nodes are normally supported. It's difficult to know what's going wrong in your case without more details:
* Given the example from Sirius Destkop, I assume you are using an existing odesign file? How is it defined? In particular the border nodes mapping and their creation tool.
* You mention ports are not showing, I assume this means the Model and InputFiles are correctly displayed?

Thanks for the quick response. 
Yes: Model and InputFile are correctly displayed.

I am using an existing odesign file. I've attached the odesign for reference (as a txt file). I read that reused bordered node mappings currently don't work. This is actually the case for the InputFile class (where I reuse them from the Model class), but I'd expect that adding bordered nodes to `Model` should still work (and is ignored for InputFile). The behavior I see when I add an InPort to a Model, the model object in the tree on the left is replaced by the InPort in the visualisation.
Manually adding an InPort to a Model in the tree does not visualize it either (but gives the same error in the log)

We just need to provide the default Spring MVC implementation somewhere else in a dedicated projects where we can isolate this dependency.

The second one can also easily be mitigated since the `ImageRegistry` does not have any interfaces, applications integrating Sirius Components cannot replace its behavior without having to fork it. Extracting this class in such a project would simplify the use of Sirius Components.

### Screenshots

I am inducing an error in the palette by disabling the network before using a tool, after enabling the network again we can see that the palette is successfully fetched on different elements but the error still appears.

- Make the palette go into an error state
- Invoke another palette

The ""Create View"" operation (for example inside a ""Drop Tool"") correctly creates a _Create View Request_, but when actually trying to render the corresponding nodes, `ViewDiagramDescriptionConverter.getUnsynchronizedSemanticElements(VariableManager, NodeDescription)` is called to find the actual semantic elements for which (unsynchronized) nodes should be rendered. `getUnsynchronizedSemanticElements()` is supposed to return the list of these semantic elements (used [here](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/blob/master/backend/sirius-components-diagrams/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/components/diagrams/components/NodeComponent.java#L81)), but since 9947fcd9dee740fa3d8b1d21780cad0b40295b71 it returns a list of `Optional` wrapping these elements.

I have a design question regarding sirius-web.

Do you maybe have an idea how I could realize the concept? I thought of choosing the node type in the properties tab, but the problem is that one node type should be represented by a container. I also dont know how I can change the domain class of an element dynamically at runtime. Therefore I would be very thankful if you could help me.

### Steps to reproduce

When an Enum has a literal not equals to its name, then in the PropertySections the name is used by default for the label and for the new value. 
It causes two problems:
- The label displays the name (the literal is meant for that as it allows values with special characters)
- When trying to apply a new value, it causes an error.

By using literal instead of name in both label provider and new value handler, there are no more problems.

1. I added the ""/resources/images"" to the list, but it does not change anything
2.  how can I check that?
3. the url is ""localhost:8080/api/images/resources/images/application.svg"". It does not show the image, when i try to go to the link. 
I think it should be ""http://localhost:8080/api/images/images/application.svg"", because there I can access the image. When I change the workspace-image path manually to /packagename.design/images... instead of /packagename.design/resources/images it also works

### Steps to reproduce

There is no specific scenario. This is a wrong coding issue in the ViewFormDescriptionConverterSwitch following methods:

- getMultiSelectNewValuesHandler
- getNewValueHandler
- getSelectNewValueHandler

Each time, the ""newValue"" variable is put in the global variableManager scope, and not in the child scope (variableManager.createChild()) 
...

### Expected behavior

We should use variableManager.createChild() before putting the ""newValue"" variable.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Import the project [Broken Egde Studio.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/9027734/Broken.Egde.Studio.zip)
2. Create a project, a model, and the root entity based on the `brokenEdge` domain
3. Create a new diagram based on the `Broken Edge Description`
4. Create three entities
5. Create an edge between two of them
6. Create another edge between two different entities
7. Try to move each entity separately

### Expected behavior

When the second edge is created, the first created edge should not be moved.
When entities are moved separately, edges should follow their ends.

### Actual behavior

When the second edge is created, the first created edge is moved to the same location as the newly created one (they overlap each other).
When entities are moved separately, some edges seem to fly.

1. Create a topography diagram
2. Click on `CaptureSubSystem` and expand the tool section, the default tool should be a _Fan_
3. Create a processor using the processor creation tool
4. Click again on `CaptureSubSystem`

### Expected behavior

The default tool should be a _Processor_

### Actual behavior

The default tool is still a _Fan_","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1305/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For more complex operations it is possible to drop down to Java using service classes/methods invoked from AQL expressions and registered with an `IJavaServiceProvider`.

However, the way these Java service classes are currently instantiated means they can not have access to the APIs the platform defines (e.g. `IObjectService`) and thus their power is very limited.

If the element was dropped on a *node*, the drop handler has access to the `selectedNode` variable which points to it (a `Node`). If the element was dropped directly on the diagram's background howewer, the `selectedNode` variable is not defined at all.
This is fine for drop handlers which are defined directly in Java, as they can inspect the `VariableManager` they are passed to see in which case they are and choose the appropriate behavior.

For drop handlers which are defined using the View DSL however, their is no way to do this. There is no operation to test if some variable is defined, and if an AQL expression uses the `selectedNode` variable and is invoked in a context it is not defined, this raises an error.

One possibility would be to define the variable to `null` when dropping on the diagram's background, but it feels like a hack.
In addition, the name `selectedNode` is not very well chosen IMO. There is nothing ""selected"" (in the sense of the workbench's selection) here.

Another approach would be to define a new variable with a more explicit name, say `dropTarget`, which is always defined but will be either the `Diagram` or the `Node`. This way an AQL expression can refer this variable and e.g. pass it to a Java service:

`aql:dropTarget.onDrop(self)`

```java
public EObject onDrop(Diagram diagram, EObject self) {
  // Dropped on the diagam background
}

public EObject onDrop(Node node, EObject self) {
  // Dropped on a particular node
}

If we go this way, the `selectedNode` could be deprecated, or completely removed.

Inside the Java service you may need to reference instances of `org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.description.NodeDescription` (for example to build a `ViewCreationRequest`).
Inside that service, if you need to locate ""the `description.NodeDescription` which corresponds to the `view.NodeDescription` named 'MyDomainClass_Description'"", the easiest way at the moment is to find it in this map with something like:

```java
convertedNodes.entrySet().stream()
  .filter(entry -> entry.getKey().getName().equals(""MyDomainClass_Description""))
  .map(Map.Entry::getValue)
  .findFirst();
```

There might be other ways to do this without the map, searching inside the converted `DiagramDescrition` and relying on how `ViewDiagramDescriptionConverter.idProvider` currently works, but its even more convoluted and seems brittle.

Ideally, https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1328 would provide injectable APIs that hide all this complexity from the studio makers and render this variable useless, but in the meantime this variables enables these scenarios.

### Expected behavior

In such case, I would expect no error to appear.
I don't see the reason why a service should always return an object.

The workaround is to always return an object but it often ends up with odd code in the service.

### Actual behavior

An error message appears saying that something went wrong with the execution of the tool.

But my main problem that it makes my code inconsistent.

I have a creation service that should return the new instance. However, in some cases the creation might fail (for some business reasons). It seems a bit strange in that case to return _self_.

I found it a bit strange to document the return value of my service like this,  ""Return the new instance or self if the creation fails?""
Moreover, what happen if there is another operation using that service result. Returning self would maybe do unwanted stuff and hide a bug.  Returning null would fail and make it clearer.

### Screenshots

Migrating to 2022.7.14  (from 2022.7.7) my representations contributed programmatically using _IRepresentationDescriptionsProvider_ can no longer be created. The representations already created are still working, but I can't create new one.

### Steps to reproduce

* Provide a new _IRepresentationDescription_ using a _IRepresentationDescriptionsProvider_ service
* Try to created it in a project


### Expected behavior

This representation should be available for creation.

### Actual behavior

The representation is missing.


### Workaround

Contribute a _IRepresentationDescriptionsProvider_ that specifically handles the contributed representation

```java
@Service
public class XXRepresentationDescriptionProvider implements IRepresentationDescriptionsProvider {

    private final Set<String> contributedRepresentationIds = new HashSet<>();

    public XXRepresentationDescriptionProvider() {
        super();
    }

    public void addReprensetation(String id) {
        this.contributedRepresentationIds.add(id);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean canHandle(IRepresentationDescription representationDescription) {
        return this.contributedRepresentationIds.contains(representationDescription.getId());
    }

    @Override
    public List<RepresentationDescriptionMetadata> handle(IEditingContext editingContext, Object object, IRepresentationDescription representationDescription) {
        return List.of(new RepresentationDescriptionMetadata(representationDescription.getId(), representationDescription.getLabel(), representationDescription.getLabel()));
    }

}
```

And then programmatically add the ids of the contributed representation using _addRepresentation(String id)_ method.

### More details

In my specific use case I'm creating a View using View metamodel API.
Then converts it to _IRepresentationDescription_ using the converter.

By switching from Spring Boot 2.7.x to Spring Boot 3.X, we will directly move from Spring Security 5.7.x to Spring Security 6.x and thus encounter the API breaks in question.
- We are extending `PagingAndSortingRepository` in multiple interfaces in `sirius-web-persistence` and this interface will now longer extend `CrudRepository` so any piece of code using things like `IProjectRepository` or `IDocumentRepository` would stop having access to methods such as `findById`, `delete`, `save`. To restore this behavior, our various repositories will have to switch to `extends PagingAndSortingRepository<XXX, YYY>, ListCrudRepository<XXX, YYY>`.

We may also encounter some changes in websocket support or method security, but I haven't evaluated those parts yet.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5PHabs/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

After multiple tests, hibernate cannot work with anything less than Antler 4.10 and AQL does not work with this version. It's a bit surprising since AQL, which requires Antler 4.7.2 was working fine with Antler 4.8 at least (with a red warning in the console).

### Steps to reproduce

#### Create View

1. Create a Diagram Description in a new View Model (domain type: `flow::System`)
2. Add a Node Description (domain type: `flow::CompositeProcessor`)
3. Add an Edge Description (domain type: `flow::DataFlow`)
4. Add two edge Tool for the Edge Description (no need to make them actually do something)

#### Reproduce

1. In the same project, create a robot flow model
2. Create a new diagram based on the created diagram description above
3. Create an edge using the connector tool (first tool in the palette)

### Expected behavior

A sub-menu should display the two edge creation tool defined in the edge description.

### Actual behavior

An error is raised instead of displaying available tools and, the edge creation feedback is still activated.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1378/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That will not be enough (I tested). If the handler returns an empty list of candidate tools, the frontend never displays the context menu, so no edge tool is invoked.
1. The end user gets zero feedback about what is wrong.
2. The `edgeCreationFeedback.reset()` is never called on the frontend (it's normally invoked after we call a tool), so the edge creaation feedback stays active.

### Screenshots

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28688370/195862192-04f04c22-f97f-4b06-ad76-d3da972a1cc5.png)


### Steps to reproduce

```
cd vscode-extension
npm ci
npm run compile
vsce package
```
Import the resulting `.vsix` file as extension in VSCode.

### Expected behavior

The image is displayed.

### Actual behavior

Error 404 due to the fact that VSCode is looking for the image in the repository instead of packaging it in the `vsix` file. Since the image is not in `/images` but in `/vscode-extension/images`, VSCode cannot find it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1411/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is a known issue.
Since the prettier v2.0.0, the _end of line_ option changed from `auto` to `lf` (https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#end-of-line)

We have a fix being addressed here https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/pull/1380
In the meantime you can execute `npx turbo run format` before `npx turbo run start`.

That being said, windows users may meet another build issue without a proper npm `script-shell` configuration.
To build the package `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-diagrams` the command `mkdir` command is required.
According to the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/config#script-shell) the default value for `script-shell` configuration on windows is `cmd.exe` which does not support the `mkdir` command.

You can set the `script-shell` configuration with the following command:
`npm config set script-shell ""path\\to\\bash.exe""`.

We should document this in the `README.md` for Windows users.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5MV4SZ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* [x] **I have checked that this bug appears on Chrome**
* [x] **I have specified the version** :
- latest
* [x] **I have specified my environment** : 
- my computer: Windows

### Steps to reproduce

0- You should run at least sirius-web v2022.9.7
1- Import the project [bug view.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/9801347/bug.view.zip)
  - If the import failed the project may have been created

2- Wait 6sec the imported `View` model to be converted
3- Open the imported project
  - If the project import has failed earlier create a new model
  - Create a _Root_ object based on `sanderson` domain
  - Create a _Class_ object in _Root_
  - Create a `New sanderson Representation`
  - The class should be displayed with a small blue rectangle

4- Remove the `RectandgleNodeStyle` from the only node description in the `View` model
5- Return to the _Project View_
6- Wait 6sec the `View` model to be converted
7- Open the project
8- Display `New Sanderson Representation`

### Expected behavior

The node without node style is still displayed but with a default rectangle style. 

### Actual behavior

It will tell you the diagram does not exist and there is an NPE in the server logs:

This should be optional, only enabled on _Textfield_ widgets which explicitly provide a completion proposal provider. Ideally, there should be some visible affordance on such widgets to tell the end-user that completion is available on this widget.

The user-experience should be globally similar to what is customary in editors and IDEs like VS Code or Eclipse, but without all the bells and whistles:

* triggered on some key combination (Ctrl+Space if possible), which sends a request to the backend;
* upon receiving the possible completion proposals from the backend, open them in a list at the cursor's position;
* if the user selects one of the proposals (using the mouse or, ideally, using the arrow keys), insert the proposal's text.

Basically in this use case I would like to express for a Parametric Image of type ""Note"" set the width of the figure always X pixel bigger than the label. 
I'm not sure it if it is related but in the case of a Package, I would like to express the fact that the children should not be moved in the top box header.

I see two options:
1. we pass some generic structure with all the style properties, determined reflectively/dynamicaly, and re-interpret this generic ""style map"" on the front in each widget (e.g. `sirius-components-formdescriptioneditors/src/LabelWidget.tsx`) to display them.
2. we create specialized types of components/props (on the back) and widgets/widget props (on the front).

```java
String diagramDescriptionURI = EcoreUtil.getURI(viewDiagramDescription).toString();
return DiagramDescription.newDiagramDescription(UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes(diagramDescriptionURI.getBytes()).toString())
```

i.e. the id of the resulting DiagramDescription is based on the View model element's URI... which includes its index. Something like `sirius:///d79a46d4-272b-49f9-b1a5-747f778853ea#//@descriptions.1`. This index is *not* stable.

1. Create a View model with two diagram descriptions D1 and D2 (they can be empty).
2. In another project, create an instance of D2.
3. Go back in the View model, and delete D1. It was not used anywhere so this should not have any impact.
4. Try to reopen the instance of D2:

```
java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at java.base/java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(Objects.java:221) ~[na:na]
	at org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.diagrams.DiagramContext.update(DiagramContext.java:53) ~[sirius-components-collaborative-diagrams-2022.9.8.jar:2022.9.8]

```

Indeed, we try to find the diagram description for D2, but it does not exist anymore at the expected id. Because we re-convert the current version of the View model on-demand, `DynamicRepresentationDescriptionService.findDynamicRepresentationDescriptions(IEditingContext)` will return, for the same D2 description, a Java DiagramDescription with a different id.

Note that in this particular case the id we search for does not exist anymore.
I think it is also possible (though I have not tested) for a diagram to ""change its nature"", for example if in the View model I had a D3 *after* D2. Once D1 is removed, D3 ""steals"" the id previously used by D2. Re-opening an existing D2 instance would transform it into a D3...

In particular they have no `name`, which causes an NPE in `ViewFormDescriptionConverterSwitch.casePieChartDescription(PieChartDescription)` or `ViewFormDescriptionConverterSwitch.caseBarChartDescription(BarChartDescription)` (on `.label(viewPieChartDescription.getName())`).

Once one of these widgets have been added, and until the user configures them properly, the resulting Form Description is invalid. It can not be instanciated, and existing instances of the form can not be re-opened: `ViewConverter.convert()` catches the NPE and returns nothing for this form description.

This is related to https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/pull/1449#issuecomment-1303624548: the way `AddWidgetEventHandler` creates instances of the Widget Description classes can not ensure they are well-formed.

For this particular issue we could try and initialize the `BarCharDescrption` and `PieChartDescription` with non-broken values in `AddWidgetEventHandler` but that is rather _ad-hoc_.
Note than setting a non-null name is not enough: it fixes the conversion but produces a Form which crashes when rendered.

### Expected behavior

When building programmatically the view model, it would be nice to have directly access the constants for variable used in expressions. Some are already public, some others aren't.

### Already exported

```java
public static final String EDGE_SOURCE = org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.description.EdgeDescription.EDGE_SOURCE;

    public static final String EDGE_TARGET = org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.description.EdgeDescription.EDGE_TARGET;

    public static final String SEMANTIC_EDGE_TARGET = org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.description.EdgeDescription.SEMANTIC_EDGE_TARGET;

    public static final String DIAGRAM_CONTEXT = IDiagramContext.DIAGRAM_CONTEXT;

    public static final String DELETION_POLICY = DeleteFromDiagramEventHandler.DELETION_POLICY;

    public static final String SELF = VariableManager.SELF;
```

`CustomImageLoader ` allows to store images from an a Path folder. this Path folder is taken by environment variable and should be gieven when starting the application.
Moreover this Path is absolute so it is not possible to provide the image in projects

### Expected behavior

The path is provided by Spring property and the images can be provided in the bundled projects

1. Import the following project in sirius-web [reconnection-issue.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/10083462/reconnection-issue.zip)
2. Create a `New Representation root` diagram on _instance/Root_ element
3. You should see two edges, they are defined as followed:
  a. Reconnecting _increase_ from _t0_ to _t1_ should increase the _Entity_ counter by 1
  b. Reconnecting _decrease_ from _t0_ to _t1_ should decrease the _Entity_ counter by 1
4. Reconnect _increase_ from _t0_ to _t1_ then reconnect _decrease_ from _t0_ to _t1_

### Expected behavior

The _Entity_ counter should be equal to `0`

### Actual behavior

The _Entity_ counter is equal to `-2` or `2`, it will depend on which one of the reconnection tools has been converted from View DSL.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1485/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Expected behavior

Today, the `BarChart` widget in form/form description editor has a fixed size (width: 500, height: 250).
If it is configured with a lot of data, the rendering can be ugly.
Allow users to configure `width` and `height` could be useful, in order to get a nice `BarChart` render in any case.

### Cuttings backs

...

### Potential side effects

Users will be able to configure `width` and `height` with values like `0` which will lead to `BarChart` rendering problems.

1. Create a view with a diagram description
2. In another project, create an instance of that diagram
3. Export the view project and the instance project in two zips
4. Either delete both projects or switch to a different instance of Sirius Web
5. Import the project with the view definition (should be OK)
6. Import the project with the diagram instance: this fails.

The backend shows in its logs that the representation stored in the instance project's archive could not be recreated.

What happens is that the `diagramDescriptionId` is computed like this:

```java
String diagramDescriptionURI = EcoreUtil.getURI(viewDiagramDescription).toString();
return DiagramDescription.newDiagramDescription(UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes(diagramDescriptionURI.getBytes()).toString())
```

i.e. it depends on the URI of the `viewDiagramDescription`, which is of the form:

```
sirius:///4553afdc-10bb-452c-a06e-85f7aa288e80#//@descriptions.0
```

and thus depends on **the enclosing document id**.

When the exported view is re-imported the second time, it is in a new document which will get a different UUID. The diagram description created from this re-imported version will get a `diagramDescription` which *can not* match the one stored in the diagram instance.

Note that the issue will occur even if the view and diagram instance are exported/imported in the same project. `ProjectImporter` adjusts explicit id references to the id changes but here the reference is not directly to the modified document id but to a UUID derived from it.

When implementing a source reconnection tool of a feature base edge, we are missing a way to access the semantic target of the edge.

* editingContext - Like it is done in other tools (since we now have access to IObjectService in ALQ services)

### Screenshots

![ToolNoIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/717752/207323270-7412de3c-7d04-42fc-b29d-75360c39739b.png)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Your SiriusWeb instance should not have the Domain package, only View package
2. Create a View model 
3. Create a Diagram Description that applies on an existing class from a metamodel (not from a Domain)
4. Create a valid Node that applies on an existing class from the same metamodel
5. Create a Diagram from the Diagram Description
6. Click on the diagram background: a creation tool is provided by default, based on the Diagram Description and the View.

### Expected behavior

The canonical creation tool provided by default should have an icon, ideally the icon associated to the EClass/DomainClass.

### Actual behavior

The canonical creation tool provided by default doesn't have any icon.

### Help resources

The problem comes from `ViewDiagramDescriptionConverter.java`. `String NODE_CREATION_TOOL_ICON = ""/img/Entity.svg"";` & `EDGE_CREATION_TOOL_ICON = ""/img/Relation.svg"";` refer to SVG coming from Domain package.

### Solution proposed

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a `View` model
2. Create a `Diagram Description` that applies on an valid class. No auto layout.
3. Create a valid `Node` that applies on a valid class. Its default style is `RectangularNodeStyle`. Check `Header` style option.
5. Create a `Diagram` from the `Diagram Description`
6. Add an element in the `Diagram` to display a `Node`.

### Expected behavior

The created `Node` can be resized.

### Actual behavior

The created `Node` can't be resized.
The problem only occurs when the `Header` style option is applied on the `Node`.

If I use an image of size 50×50 for a node, it will be created with this size, and keep it when I move the node (or other nodes on the diagram). Assuming we are not in auto-layout.
However when I launch an ""Arrange All"", ELK resizes my image nodes to get the same default size as a basic rectangular node. *Then* when I move something again, they get back to their 50×50 size.

1. create View
2. create Diagram Description and a domain based Edge with a begin label and an end label
3. create a model and a Diagram based on step 2
4. create elements to get two diagram nodes and a diagram edge between the diagram nodes
5. try to move one of the diagram nodes

### Expected behavior

The begin label and the end label are moving smoothly while the node is moving. When the user finishes to move the node, the begin label and the end label locations are near the nodes.
It seems to already work for the ""middle"" label of an edge. May be applying the same algorithm for the begin label and the end label would be enough.

The begin label and the end label are moving weirdly while the node is moving.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Creates a new Robot flow model.
2 .From the System Robot, create a new Topography representation.
3. Check all edges are properly routed in a rectilinear style to avoid crossing nodes.
4. Move some element on the diagram (any one).
5. Check that only edges connected to the moved element have been re-routed

### Expected behavior

Edges are properly re-routed

### Actual behavior

Edges are not properly re-routed

The frames of the classes are ok, except those that touch the outer border of the exported image.
It seems the image frame is exactly on the lines of the class frame, hence it appears to be thinner compared to the others.

Currently we have a single expression which is expected to return a single number that is used for both dimensions: `size = Size.of(computedSize, computedSize)`

Options:

1. replace `sizeComputationExpression` with separate `widthComputationExpression` and `heightComputationExpression`: simple to understand and implement, makes it possible to specify one dimension of not the other, but breaks existing diagram modeles and adds yet more elements in an already crowded details view.
2. allow `sizeComputationExpression` to return full-blown `Size` objects, either as a string representation (`aql:'150,' + self.computedHeight()`) or with a new globally acessible service: `aql:self.makeSize(150, self.computedHeight()`). Feels cleaner but more costly to implement and brittle in the case of a string-based representation (need to define the syntax, to parse it properly).

This is useful to provide richer details view with widgets more precisely chosen/configured than what the generic choices would make.

There are other kinds of attributes which are currently encoded as raw `EString` or `EInt` but could benefit from being more precise:
- `Color` (EString): could be represented with a color picker when we get support for that.
- `Dimension` or `Length`: currently any string, but if we (the widget) knew it is supposed to represent a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) we could provide some [client side validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types#numeric_field).
- `Feature(Name)` (EString): this is similar to `DomainType`. It is supposed to reference the name of a meta-model element feature (for example in `CreateInstance.referenceName`) and could benefit from some completion/validation support with a more precise definition than ""a string"".

Note that adding these data types would be useful even just in terms of documentation if we do not exploit them immediatly.

### Expected behavior

We want to speed up the creation of a basic project with some data and representations.
For that, we will introduce project templates, created by a specifier, in order to have a one-click solution to get started.
Project templates will be displayed in the `/projects` page.
Each template will be displayed using an image statically provided by the backend and a label.
Clicking on the template on the frontend should redirect the user to the workbench with everything properly initialized.

### Expected behavior

Today, in diagrams, nodes' inside labels are displayed on a single line (except if the text includes line breaks), no matter the size of its node. The label may exceed the size of its node.
Also, in case of diagrams with manual-layout, when the user clicks on ""arrange all"" button, the size of nodes sometimes adapt to the size of their labels, sometimes not.
Furthermore, the nodes inside a container node are not overlapping the container node' label after the arrange all.

The goal is that inside label of a node should never exceed the size of its node.

When we are creating objects using a dedicated tool from the view DSL with some model operations, they are created using the EPackages available in the package registry of the editing domain.

Let's consider a click on `New Operational Entity` which comes with a dedicated node tool using the view DSL.

<img width=""2048"" alt=""03 - New object from view with createInstance model operation"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/422587/213420115-8ddc9666-490b-405c-90e9-7b5a2426aa5b.png"">

As a result, it is quite easy to create a model in which the root object and objects created using the view DSL do not share the same EPackage. For some reason, this does not seems to create any issue in my case.

<img width=""2048"" alt=""05 - Incompatible EPackages"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/422587/213420355-d8d4d822-21ca-45fe-bf0e-a3a5373ecf42.png"">

The problem becomes obvious since, when we are creating objects using the view DSL thanks to a canonical tool, the EPackage used is the EPackage of `self` and thus the source of the metamodel to use may change depending on the target of the tool.

Let's consider a click on `New Operational Actor` which rely on the canonical behavior.

```typescript

const contextualPalette: Palette = {
      palettePosition,
      canvasBounds: bounds,
      edgeStartPosition,
      element,
      renameable: !(element instanceof SGraph),
      deletable: !(element instanceof SGraph),
};

```

But everywhere we use the palette we are manipulating sprotty objets :

```typescript

if (renameable) {
      invokeLabelEditFromContextualPalette = () =>
        diagramServer.actionDispatcher.dispatchAll([
          { kind: HIDE_CONTEXTUAL_TOOLBAR_ACTION },

}

if (deletable) {
      invokeDeleteFromContextualPalette = (deletionPolicy: GQLDeletionPolicy) =>
        deleteElements([element], deletionPolicy);
}
```

Since we are manipulating Sprotty objects we could rely on Sprotty features - set in `convertDiagram.tsx` - instead.
We could change `if` statements by:

- `if (isWithEditableLabel(element)) {`
- `if (isDeletable(element) {`

Thus, `renamable` and `deletable` `Palette` attributes are entirely avoidable.

### Current behavior
Currently, when a node with a parametric svg is resized, the image proportion is kept and so the feedback will let appear large empty areas on top/bottom or left/right depending on the resize direction.

### Expected behavior
During the resize the image should be resized ti fit the rectangle size. It would provide a better resize feedback

- Delete `IDataFetcherWithFieldCoordinates`

After that, add a dependency to 

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```

in the various `graphql` projects such as:

- `sirius-components-diagrams-graphql`
- `sirius-components-forms-graphql`
- `sirius-components-selection-graphql`
- `sirius-web-graphql`

And change all the data fetchers from this:

```
@MutationDataFetcher(type = ""Mutation"", field = MutationCreateProjectDataFetcher.CREATE_PROJECT_FIELD)
public class MutationCreateProjectDataFetcher implements IDataFetcherWithFieldCoordinates<IPayload> {
    @Override
    public IPayload get(DataFetchingEnvironment environment) throws Exception {
        // ...
    }
}
```

to this:

```
@Controller
public class MutationCreateProjectDataFetcher {
    @MutationMapping
    public IPayload createProject(@Argument CreateProjectInput input) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Once this is done, you will also need to remove the dependency to `subscription-transport-ws` to use `graphql-ws` instead on the frontend.

When everything is over and the code compiles, use the following configuration properties in the application{-dev}.properties of Sirius Web:

- `spring.graphql.path` for the path of the GraphQL API (something like `/api/graphql` should do the trick for Sirius Web)
- `spring.graphql.websocket.path` for the path of the subscriptions (I think that we are using `/api/subscription` currently in Sirius Web)

After that a release will be needed to let consumers of Sirius Components adapt to this sizable API change.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1630/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* [X] **I have checked that this bug appears on Chrome**

### Actual behavior

The schema location is not persisted in the JSON Resource
So when the schema location is used to resolved specific 


Example for an UML resource serialized in JSON

schemaLocation is used to resolve URI using nsURI. Here see `profileNotGenerated`
```

  ]
}
```

### Steps to reproduce

It is reproducible only with application using UML
There is no reproducible scenario in Sirius-web
The valdiation is checking that the serialization of the JSON resource still works. (There are existng tests to check that ;) )

### Expected behavior

the schema location should be serialized when needed

1. Clone and build sources
```
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components.git
cd sirius-components
npm ci
npx turbo run build
cd packages
mvn clean install
```
2. Fix bug in docker-compose.yml
```
cd sirius-web/backend/sirius-web-sample-application
```
Add build context to app in docker-compose.yml:
```
  app:
    image: siriusweb
    build:
      context: .
```
3. Run sample application:
```
docker compose up --build
```
4. Open http://localhost:8080 in browser. Get 404 error
5. Open http://localhost:8080/graphiql/index.html in browser. Works fine. So it seems the application is started. There are no any errors in log as well

If I run it without docker, then I get the same error.

That is not related.

About the behavior:

- Using the creation tool initialize the node with the minHeight possible.
- Using the resize to decrease the container height does not resize children since they are already at their minimum size.
- Then, using the resize to increase the container height also increase the child nodes' height. I choose to implement the resize like this without having this case in mind.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5URVQS/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

And I can resize their parent any way I want, they never seems to stick to the bottom of their parent to grow as their parent grow. The only reasonable approach I can think of is to let this behavior be configurable using something like `ListLayout#justifyItems` which could take `start` and `stretch` as values because both behavior have their use.

So in the end, it seems that we want both kinds of behavior while not giving any way to choose the expected behavior. We both need to make this configurable and explicit in our algorithm.

The `future.get()` call has no timeout, so if for some reason the handler does not terminate (infinite loop, deadlock...), the http handler thread which executes `EditingContextEventProcessor` stays blocked indefinitely. If enough http requests trigger the offending handler, we can get to a point where enough threads are holding server resources (e.g. JDBC connections) that new requests can not be handled at all.

We can't do much to prevent buggy event handlers to run forever, but we can probably avoid the blocking to affect the `EditingContextEventProcessor`'s thread.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a Robot Flow model
2. Create any kind of representation on any semantic element
3. Rename the newly created representation with a very long name without spaces  

### Expected behavior

The close button (cross) should be available on the opened representation tab.
An ellipsis should be added to the tab title to avoid problems.

### Actual behavior

The close button (cross) is not available on the opened representation tab.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Use the Robot Flow model
2. Select the System item in the Explorer View
3. Create a new representation on the system element with name > 50 characters

### Expected behavior

The new name is taken into account or is not taken into account but an error message appears in the snackbar.
It is possible to rename any other tree item or any field in the details view after that.

### Actual behavior

All files have similar errors.

I have tried generic solution that I found for the encountered errors, but could not succeed to make it work.
I tried on another machine as well, thinking there might be a problem with my computer's configuration, but got the exact same result. 
Maybe I did something wrong while following the steps to build, but as of now, I can not find what. I apologize in advance if this issue was already tackled in the documentation, I tried to look for it but could not find anything.

### Frontend Error

`Warning: fragment with name labelFields already exists. graphql-tag enforces all fragment names across your application to be unique; read more about this in the docs`

### Proposition

There are two graphql fragments with the same name `labelFields`: one in `packages/diagrams/frontend/sirius-components-diagrams/src/representation/operations.ts` and one in `packages/forms/frontend/sirius-components-forms/src/form/FormEventFragments.ts`.

The one from `FormEventFrgaments.ts` should be renamed to `labelWidgetFields` to avoid name collision.

### Expected behavior

Project template cards may lead to have the sirius web projects page larger than the  web browser full screen width.
So, we suggest to all templates are equally distributed along a grid.
Furthermore, if a template name exceeds its card size, the name is wrapped on several lines.
We suggest to let the template name on one line with an ellipsis if it exceeds its card size. A tooltip will also be added to be able to read the full name in every case.

How could we both ""compute the size of a node to give it enough room to display its label on one line"" and ""keep the size of the node stable and wrap the label instead""? Shouldn't we just says that a node has always a requested size which can be requested by:

- the application (think about the default sizes of the new nodes)
- the specifier (think `widthExpression` / `heightExpression`)
- the end user (think about the end user having resized a node in the past)

In some cases the information given by the label (or at least some of them) is only really useful when focusing on the edge itself, or maybe the source and/or target node.

Proposal: allow each of the 3 labels of an edge to be configured so that it is not displayed by default, but only made visible when the edge itself is selected. Optionally we may want to also reveal the labels if its source node or target node are visible.

You first need to tell NPM that these packages are to be found on GitHub Packages. This is done  by adding `@eclipse-sirius:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/eclipse-sirius` into your `.npmrc` (either global in your `HOME` or local to your project).

Then, even though `eclipse-sirius` is a Open Source & public project, GitHub requires that you use a token when accessing the corresponding GitHub Package, see https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages. So you need to create a personal token as mentioned by Axel, and again tell NPM to use that token to authenticate on `npm.pkg.github.com`.

1. Start from an empty server (probably not necessary, but easier to analyze).
2. Import [created-before.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/11234774/created-before.zip). Its a basic project with a ""Robot Flow"". Select the ""Robot"" element and note that all the expected representations can be created on it.
3. Go back to the projects list (do *not* keep ""created-before"" open in a tab/window) and import [studio.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/11234779/studio.zip). It contains a View with an empty diagram definition which applies to `flow::System`.
4. Go back to the projects list and import [created-after.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/11234800/created-after.zip). Except for the name, it's identical to ""created-before"" and just provided for convenience.
5. In ""created-after"", select the ""Robot"" system element. The ""NewDiag"" (defined in the studio) should be available. Create it. *Sometimes* the stack appears then, but most of the times I tested, there was still no error at this point.
6. Go back to the projects list and re-open ""created-before"" (it should have been closed for at least 6 seconds at this point, the longer the better).

This can happen without the exception above even occuring. I'm not sure yet, but maybe the exception is a symptom after the fact, and the root cause occurs before.

1. Create a project which takes a significant time to load. For example create 3 or 4 ""Big Guy"" flow models in it.
2. Go back to the projects list, and wait for it to be released.
3. Click to re-open it, and *as soon as the project edition page becomes visible* (with the explorer still empty as the editing context has not yet loaded), go back to the project list.

This systematically reproduces the stack trace for me, but still the project/editing context gets released properly after a while.

In Sirius Desktop, the `input` variable is an instance of `org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core.api.SiriusInputDescriptor` (see [here](https://github.com/pcdavid/org.eclipse.sirius/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/api/SiriusInputDescriptor.java)).

It represents the selection/context which triggered the display of the properties view.
It can be seen as a more structured/richer version of `self` with additional services.

It is created in `org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties.internal.tabprovider.SiriusTabDescriptorProvider.get(IWorkbenchPart, ISelection, IEEFTabbedPropertySheetPageContributor)` from the Eclipse `ISelection` and then exposed as a variable to ""everyone"" inside the EEF-based view:

```java
variableManager.put(EEFExpressionUtils.INPUT, input);
```

### In Sirius Web

We need to expose a variable named `input` of a *new* type (it can not be the Sirius Desktop `SiriusInputDescriptor`, which is tied to Sirius Desktop itself, EEF and the Eclipse platform).

The variable must be available in all contexts where View expressions originating from the converted `umlProperties.odesign` will need it.
All ""core"" services (methods from `SiriusInputDescriptor`) must be implemented in the Web version of `input`.

Further analysis is needed to characterize more precisely the actual usages.
For example, it seem all 238 occurences of `input.getContextSelections()` are actually to test if `input.getContextSelections()->size()>1`.
It would be enough to some ""dummy"" singleton collection, even through `getContextSelections()` in Sirius Desktop actually returns a `List<SiriusContext>`, but `SiriusContext` is itself specific to the desktop version, and given the usages we do not care about the actual content of the list returned.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1913/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This would result in a functional regression if we replaced the existing `NodeStylePropertiesConfigurer` with a more limited version.

Instead, we chose to provide a slightly customized _Details_ view for the Attribute elements in the Domain DSL.

Before, with the default/generic rules applied:

![screenshot-2023-05-24_16-45](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/assets/10608/676dec56-975d-488c-92c5-a42b221dc21f)

Differences:
- the page's title shows the attribute's type
- the type is displayed before the cardinality
- the type is selected using a Select/Combo instead of a radio group
- the type names are ""Capitalized"" intsead of ""FULL_UPPER_CASE""
- an additional read-only label shows the cardinality corresponding to the optional/many flag combination.

1. Create a new studio and upload the View model in this zip: [ViewNewModel.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/files/11561872/ViewNewModel.zip). It defines a Form on `flow::System` with two groups, each with one button.

2. Create a new ""Flow"" project, and create an instance of the Form above on the top-level System.
3. Make sure the System is selected in the explorer so that its details are visible.
4. Click on the first button: the System's weight increases (OK)
5. Click on the second button: the System's **temperatrure** should increase, but instead it's the weight (**KO**). Clicking on the second button actually invokes the behavior of the first one (more precisely: clicking on the _N_th button on *any* group invokes the _N_th button of the *first* group

When I select _None_ (which does not make sense as a choice here), I end up (on the backend) calling `attribute.setType(null)`, which sets the type to the default (here `STRING`):

It should be possible to add this with an optional AQL expression.
Maybe we could provide some helper Java services to manipulate/create `CompletionProposal` instances directly from AQL, but it might not be necessary. Most actual completion code would probably require to drop directly into a Java service, where manipulating these is trivial.

### Implementation

* In `view.ecore`, add `Textfield.completionProposalExpression : InterpretedExpression`
* In `ViewFormDescriptionConverterSwitch.caseTextfieldDescription(TextfieldDescription)`, if the `TextfieldDescription` has a non-blank `completionProposalExpression` create a `.completionProposalsProvider()` that invokes it.

### Usage

* In the View-based `TextfieldDescription`, setup a `completionProposalExpression` like `aql:self.getCompletionProposals(currentText, currentPosition)`.
* Implement (and register) the actual `getCompletionProposals()` like so:
```java
public List<CompletionProposal> getCompletionProposals(EObject self, String currentText, int currentPosition) {

This stacktrace can be reproduced using the `feedbackMessageService` in the function returned by `ViewDiagramDescriptionConverter#getSemanticElementsProvider` and then, displaying a diagram.

A solution to prevent such stacktrace to be raised will be to check before the call of the service if it is in the scope it is supposed to be thanks to, a try-catch or, in a case of a request scope: `if(RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes() != null){} ` or equivalent.

My understanding is that Sirius **Components** hard-codes in `ViewReconnectionToolsExecutor.execute()` the logic to locate the `EdgeDescription`. This hard-coded logic happens to work in the context of Sirius **Web**, but for other applications which manage their View instances differently, we should delegate to `IViewRepresentationDescriptionSearchService.findViewEdgeDescriptionById(String)` so that their own implementation of `IViewRepresentationDescriptionSearchService`, consistent with their View models integration, is used instead.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a Form Description with multiple pages.
2. Create/Open a FormDescriptionEditor.
3. Select a page on the explorer view => the FormDescriptionEditor selection should be updated to select the selected page.

### Expected behavior

The synchronization from the explorer view to the FormDescriptionEditor should work on pages.
(the same way as the synchronization from the FormDescriptionEditor's pages should work on the explorer view)

### Actual behavior

The synchronization from the explorer view to the FormDescriptionEditor don't work on pages.

### Steps to reproduce

- Create a new studio project using the ""Studio"" template.
- Download the studio project.
- From the projects page of Sirius Web, click on ""upload project"" and choose the downloaded studio.

### Expected behavior

A studio project uploaded via the ""Upload project"" button on the projects page must be imported into Sirius Web.

### Actual behavior

When uploading a studio project into Sirius Web, the project is never imported and the upload query receives from the backend an error payload: ""An unexpected error has occurred, please contact the server administrator"". No feedback is displayed in the UI about this error.
On the backend, no errors but the logs indicate that no documents have been loaded:

- The API should be renamed to something like DocumentDescription, DocumentStereotype, or DocumentTemplate since it is now only used by the NewDocumentModal
- The useless documentName field should be removed since it is specified by the end user
- This API should be called at runtime in order to compute the document to create using the editing context

```java

        VariableManager pageVariableManager = new VariableManager();
        pageVariableManager.put(VariableManager.SELF, objects);
```

Whereas in EditingContextRepresentationDescriptionsEventHandler

```java
 private List<RepresentationDescriptionMetadata> findAllCompatibleRepresentationDescriptions(IEditingContext editingContext, Object object) {
        List<RepresentationDescriptionMetadata> result = new ArrayList<>();
        var kind = this.objectService.getKind(object);

This cause issues when evaluating the _PreconditionExpression_ since the same service can *not* be reused in both cases.

*Moreover*, it seems the _Domain Type_ of the _FormDescription_ is not used to filter the _PageDescriptions_ available in the _Detail View_. If we want to reuse the _org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.emf.form.ViewFormDescriptionConverter.canCreateForm(FormDescription, VariableManager, AQLInterpreter)_ method it seems that the implementation does not expected a list of element here.

There are normally rendered with a yellow background and have completion support enabled, but this is not the case for Slider.
This is because the test to detect these `InterpretedExpression` fields is too strict and assumes all widgets are defined inside the `View` EPackage itself.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new FormDescription.
2. Add a Slider widget inside a Group.
3. Select the widget in the explorer.

In the _Details_ panel, the 4 expression attributes should be rendered with a yellow background and support completion.

This should mean ""no candidate"", but because of how `ViewFormDescriptionConverterSwitch.getMultiValueProvider(String)` is implemented this results in a non-null and non-empty list of candidates/items, with a single `""""` (empty string) item.
This causes NPEs later when when e.g. trying to determine the id/label/kind of `""""`.

Basically, an empty expression should mean ""no candidates"" (`List.of()`), and not as is the case now ""a single candidate that is the empty string"" (`List.of("""")`).

It's quite annoying because it means these widgets are not ""ready to use"" (even in an empty but valid state) on creation, and one always has to provide explicit configuration for them.

The lack of interface makes it hard for an application to override this implementation (it is directly used in _EditingContextSearchService_ ).

It could be great if it could implement an interface such as:

```java
public interface IEditingDomainFactoryService {
    AdapterFactoryEditingDomain createEditingDomain(String editingContextId);

     * Implementation which does nothing, used for mocks in unit tests.

#### Problem

The current layouts face difficulties when handling complexity, such as compartments, multiline text, and edges.

#### Key Result

We have successfully achieved correct rendering of the Papyrus Web class diagram and state machine.

#### Current State

The layout computation is performed on the backend and rendered using Sprotty.

#### Solution

To address this, we propose shifting the layout computation to the frontend of each user. We adopt React Flow and stay true to the principles and spirit of React Flow. This approach allows for more flexibility and customization in handling complex layouts. We have implemented a specific layout known as the ""incremental layout."" This layout ensures that when an element is moved close to another one, the first element automatically adjusts its position to create space between them.

#### No-go

We have ruled out the option of having a specific electron process managed by the server to compute the layout once for everyone.

The frontend can not compute this type compatibility by itself, and we do not want to query it each time the user selects an element.

Instead we will add a new flag to `TreeItem`, named `selectable`.
It will be `true` by default so that the current behavior does not change.
When rendering a Tree, the backend will be able to set the flag individually for each item.

On the frontend, the non-selectable items will have a different style.
They will still be focusable/expandable/collapsable and have a context menu (if relevant for them).
The only behavioral difference is that they will not participate in the selection.
In other words, they will never invoke the provided `setSelection` callback.

### Steps to reproduce

Just open any properties View

### Expected behavior

When widgets have no defined style, then their style properties should not be set to 'inherit', but to undefined.

### Actual behavior

When widgets have no defined style, then their style properties are set to 'inherit', which could lead to get wrong default values.
For example:

### Problematic 

Meta models expressed with EMF specify their features with a `changeable ` flag. This means that if this flag is `false`, the feature won't be editable and should be displayed as read-only.
The default form description provider should take into account this changeableness when it provides all widget descriptions for features of the selected element.

Papyrus web Advanced page of Details panel leverages this default form description provider in order to display agnostic widgets for all features of the selected element. This is confusing that a feature that is declared as read-only can be changed in that page.

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/assets/128463513/55ab5c9e-2ac9-443f-8ffe-29d087ee62cb)

Impact on:

- `org.eclipse.sirius.components.compatibility.emf.properties.EStringIfDescriptionProvider`
- `org.eclipse.sirius.components.compatibility.emf.properties.EBooleanIfDescriptionProvider`
- `org.eclipse.sirius.components.compatibility.emf.properties.EEnumIfDescriptionProvider`

- `org.eclipse.sirius.components.compatibility.emf.properties.MultiValuedNonContainmentReferenceIfDescriptionProvider`

### Steps to reproduce

Using the UML meta model for instance:

1. create a Class element
2. Select this node in the Explorer
3. Open Details panel if needed

### Expected behavior

 In Advanced page, `Qualifed name` should be read-only:

### Actual behavior

### Expected behavior

Today, to register a new validator, you have to declare a new @Configuration as it is done for `org.eclipse.sirius.components.domain.emf.configuration.DomainEMFConfiguration`.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to register a package coming from a Domain with this registration method.
For example, if I declare a new `Family` domain, then I want to add a new Validator on it, I can't do this:
`this.eValidatorRegistry.put(getFamilyPackage(), new FamilyValidator());`
because the `FamilyPackage` is created by `org.eclipse.sirius.components.domain.emf.DomainConverter` each time it is needed.

So, even if I succeeded in retrieving my `FamilyPackage` using `IEditingContextEPackageService` then it will not be the same instance of the `FamilyPackage`.

- Support for multiple labels

## Decisions

### Remove GQLNode#type in ReactFlow and don't fetch this info in the GraphQL fragment `nodeFragment`

### Feature parity between rectangular and image nodes

Combine both `RectangularNode` and `ImageNode` into a `FreeFormNode` in the frontend. In a similar fashion, we should thus have only a `FreeFormNodeLayoutHandler`. We may change the GraphQL API / Programmatic API later but this is not an issue for now. It will allow image nodes to have children and to support the drop of semantic elements. The image could be connected to the node by using CSS background property.

See:
- `background-image: url(""../img/blog.png"") no-repeat center center;`
- `background-size: contain;`
- `background-repeat: no-repeat;`

Test with an image node with child nodes to see the result

### Inside Label

#### Optional labels

There will be two kinds of labels, 0..1 label inside (and 0..12 labels outside, will be done later).
The inside label should be optional. An optional label is not an empty label, there are no direct edit support (double click, typing, F2, direct edit tool in the palette)

In the View DSL, the inside label should be a dedicated concepts `InsideLabelDescription` contained by a `NodeDescription` with the `labelExpression` it should not change anything on the label style properties contained by NodeStyle.

- Papaya should be updated in order to display nodes without an inside label
- ReactFlow should also be updated to support nodes without an inside label
- List nodes support should be updated to handle the lack of a label

#### Position

The inside label can be positioned on:
- TOP_LEFT
- TOP_CENTER
- TOP_RIGHT
- LEFT_CENTER
- CENTER
- RIGHT_CENTER
- BOTTOM_LEFT
- BOTTOM_CENTER
- BOTTOM_RIGHT

The label needs to contain its location. We need to add the following concepts:

```
public enum InsideLabelLocation {
  TOP_LEFT,
  TOP_CENTER,
  TOP_RIGHT,
  LEFT_CENTER,
  CENTER,
  RIGHT_CENTER,
  BOTTOM_LEFT,
  BOTTOM_CENTER,
  BOTTOM_RIGHT,
}
```

```
// Rename the existing LabelDescription to InsideLabelDescription
public class InsideLabelDescription {
  private Function<VariableManager, InsideLabelLocation> location;
}
```

```
// Rename the existing Label to InsideLabel
public class InsideLabel {
  private InsideLabelLocation location;
}
```

```
public class Node {
  private InsideLabel label;
}
```

At this point in time, we will not be able to have outside labels anymore. In the odesign compatibility layer the inside label will be configured to `TOP_CENTER` while it will be configurable in the View DSL.

This should be tested with list nodes

### Header

A header can be used to prevent child nodes from overlapping the label area. The header can be located at the top for TOP_XXX labels, the bottom for BOTTOM_XXX labels and on the left for LEFT_CENTER and on the right for RIGHT_CENTER labels.

A CENTER label cannot have the property header -> This should not be possible in the creation of the InsideLabel#build() and we should thus throw an IllegalArgumentException here to prevent this use case from ever reaching the frontend. Add the class in a whitelist for the GeneralPurposeTests class. In the view DSL, always remove the header option, when converting, even if the option is true when the label's location is CENTER.

In a node with a list layout strategy, the label must be a header. Throw an exception if that's not the case. In the view DSL, always set the header option to true if the parent node has a list layout strategy even if the option is set to false.

`org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.RectangularNodeStyle#withHeader` should move to `InsideLabelDescription`.

### Outside label

- Add the ability to have multiple outside labels:
  - TOP_{BEGIN | MIDDLE | END}
  - RIGHT_{BEGIN | MIDDLE | END}
  - BOTTOM_{BEGIN | MIDDLE | END}
  - LEFT_{BEGIN | MIDDLE | END}

For example, create a dummy project an import [Voltron.zip](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/files/12452013/Voltron.zip) (after unzipping it) a few times.

Then create a new, empty project. You'll notice a delay, and in the backend logs something like:

```
SlowQuery: 441 milliseconds. SQL: 'HikariProxyPreparedStatement@1672484306 wrapping SELECT * FROM Document document
WHERE length(document.content) > 0
AND document.content::jsonb @> ('{ ""ns"": { ""' || 'domain' || '"": ""' || 'http://www.eclipse.org/sirius-web/domain' ||'"" } }')::jsonb
'
```

This is because to detect the available Domain & View models we scan all existing documents *as JSON*. For large models, most of which will not be Domains or Views, but we still pay the cost of their conversion to JSON by PostgreSQL so it can make a precise query.

Adding a `AND document.content LIKE ('%' || ?2 || '%')` clause before attempting the JSON conversion improves the performance quite a lot, although it's still not perfect (I get down from ~400ms to ~40ms in my case).

I've tried `AND SUBSTRING(document.content FROM 1 FOR 512) LIKE ('%' || ?2 || '%')` to only scan the beginning of the documents (where the `ns` clauses are), but it's actually counter-productive (about twice as slow in my case, i.e around 80ms).

We should probably also store this kind of ""document nature"" outside of the document itself, but that is a more involved change for later.

In the current implement of Reference widget the operation that modify the model (Add/Set/Remove) are hard coded in _EditReferenceEventHandler.editSetting_. It could be great to extract those behaviors in a Service(ex: IReferenceWidgetService). It would offer a easy way to customize the behavior on those operations. I think this is already done for the creation of an element by using _IEditService_.

### Expected behavior

As an Application integrator, I would like to control how the reference widget handles the reference. 
For instance, I would like to control how the candidate list is built or how the widget's actions are performed.

The goal is to provide a more detailed widget EMF model that provides all AQL expressions that guarantee fine control over each operation and property.

For instance, candidatesExpression might be introduced to control the way the compatible reference objects are retrieved.
At the moment, the reference widget is inferring this candidate list through an EMF search which may be insufficient in certain situations.

```java
Stream.concat(node.getBorderNodesDescriptions().stream(), node.getChildrenDescriptions().stream())
```

This ignores reused (sub, border) nodes.

In ""normal"" cases, where we only reuse nodes defined from the same `DiagramDescription`, it does not cause any issue because the recursive walk on the `DiagramDescription`'s content will end-up finding the element.

In a case where the reused node is defined in another `DiagramDescription`, `findNodeDescriptionById` can return `Optional.empty()`. 
Clicking a such a node (which is correctly rendered) then causes an NPE:

```
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at java.base/java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(Objects.java:208) ~[na:na]
	at org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.diagrams.dto.GetPaletteSuccessPayload.<init>(GetPaletteSuccessPayload.java:30) ~[classes/:na]
	at org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.diagrams.handlers.GetPaletteEventHandler.handle(GetPaletteEventHandler.java:117) ~[classes/:na]
```

`GetPaletteEventHandler` is not ready to handle the case where `findDiagramElementDescription` is empty. In that case it leaves `palette` to `null`, and `GetPaletteSuccessPayload` rejects it.

Note that (I think) we can not ""simply"" do:

```java
List<NodeDescription> nodeDescriptionChildren = Stream.concat(
        Stream.concat(node.getBorderNodesDescriptions().stream(), node.getChildrenDescriptions().stream()),
        Stream.concat(node.getReusedBorderNodeDescriptions().stream(), node.getReusedChildNodeDescriptions().stream())).toList();
```

This could cause infinite loops if e.g. A reuses B and B reuses A (even indirectly).

### Steps to reproduce
- Have a tool/widget with three operations `A`, `B` and `C` with B child of A and C following sibling of A. By default, the self is a model element `foo`. `A` changes the context from `foo` to `bar`. `B` sets a value of `bar`. `C` sets a value of `foo`.
- Create a model based on the initial metamodel and a representation and execute the tool/widget.

### Expected behavior
The correct attributes of `foo` and `bar` have been modified.

### Actual behavior
Only `bar` has a modified attribute. If the attribute the language designer wants to modify for `bar` is also present in `foo`, the attribute of `foo` is modified instead of the `bar` attribute.
The `changeContext` doesn't introduce a new context where the value of `self` is only modified for its children. This has side effects on the next siblings.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2399/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The exception is thrown by `UUID.fromString(String)`. 

Note that `ObjectService#getId(Object)` can return a non-UUID String (e.g. a URI fragment), and the `getAncestors` method can handle non-UUID IDs in the following line:

- `IObjectService#getId` lets specifiers provide any kind of String. `ObjectService#getId(Object)` can indeed return something other than an UUID but in Sirius Web right know, I don't think there's a single valid use case which should return something other than an UUID. It should only happen in applications derived from Sirius Web.
- `ExplorerNavigationService#getAncestors` does not support anything other than UUID, that's not what the input can be (any string is a valid input here) but in Sirius Web, as of today, we should only have UUIDs here too.

While Sirius Components allows any String, Sirius Web uses UUID all the time. In order to match more closely what can be expressed with Sirius Components, we should support `String` instead of `UUID` as the identifier of the representation (even if we keep storing a UUID in said string). We should thus change `RepresentationDescriptor#id`, the repository, the database schema etc.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5n3xCW/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

To make them explicit and be sure we don't forget any:

- [ ] distinguish between the ""create connection"" handles displayed on the nodes 4 faces to _start the edge creation process_ from the ""edge source/target handle"" displayed on an existing edge's extremity to trigger a reconnection;
- [ ] only display the ""create connection"" handles (resp. ""edge source/target handle"") on a node (resp. edge) when it is selected;
- [ ] the ""create connection"" handles should appear ""greyed out"" when their parent node is selected, but highlighted when hovered (to indicate they are active elements);
- [ ] while in the process of dragging a ""create connection"" handle (so during the edge reconnection process), highlight the compatible nodes and fade the incompatible ones. This should be consistent with the feedback we have for the graphical DnD.
- [ ] for both edge creation and reconnection, allow the user to point anywhere inside the target node, not only on a tiny target/handle;
- [ ] distribute the endpoints of multiple edges which share the same side of a node so that they are visually distinguished. This includes the case where a single edge ""to self"" has both its endpoints on the same face of the same node.

If it ends up being too complex to handle all of this in this issue/PR we'll open a new one to finish the work, but all of these *must* be handled in 2023.12.0

Let's consider the following pseudo-code of a  diagram description:

```
DiagramDescription {
  name: 'Class Diagram'
  domainClass: 'code::Package'

  nodeDescriptions: [
    NodeDescription {
      name: 'Package Node Description'
      domainClass: 'code::Package',

  edgeDescriptions: [
    EdgeDescription {
      name: 'Relation Edge Description'

    },
    EdgeDescription {
      name: 'Extends Edge Description'

    EdgeDescription {
      name: 'Implements Edge Description'
      from: ['Class Node Description']
      to: ['Interface Node Description']
    }
  ]
}
```

This description is for a class diagram like representation with packages, classes and interfaces on the background of the diagram. You can also have subpackages, classes and interfaces inside of packages. You can also have a class extending another class or implementing an interface. A very basic use case for a Sirius Web diagram.

We want to define tools that can act on multiple diagram elements. Here are a couple of use cases that we want to support:

- I want a tool to create a package from multiple classes at the same level. I select multiple Classes on the background of the diagram and create a new root package or I select multiple classes in a package and create a subpackage.
- I want a tool to create a package from multiple classes and interfaces at the same level. I can select classes and interfaces on the background of the diagram to create a new package. The tool has thus to consider diagram elements created from different descriptions.
- I want a tool to create relation edges instead of Extends / Implements by selecting multiple edges at once.
- I want a tool to be applied on both classes and implements edges.

Now that we have our use cases, here are a couple of questions that needs to be answered:

- Where can we define the tools in the View DSL?
- Where will the palette appear in case of multiple selection? (maybe on the last selected element when the user will Ctrl+click on various diagram elements)
- What should be displayed in the palette in case of a multiple selection? (probably only the tools relevant to the entire selection and the delete and show / hide tools)
- We would need various improvements to the GraphQL API with a `SingleClickOnMultipleDiagramElementsTool` / `invoke SingleClickOnMultipleDiagramElementsTool`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2450/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In the example above, assume we have 10 classes on the diagrams and one interface in the middle (that he may not notice). The user selected all the classes with a zone/rectangle selection tool, but _just because_ there is a single interface in the selection, the tool he wanted to use (which only handles classes) is nowhere to be seen in the palette, with no feedback about why.

For example, when a user try to Drag and drop an element in an other one, the user should be informed that the DnD is not possible or user could be informed of additional information.

To inform user, we would like to use `org.eclipse.sirius.components.representations.Message`. Unfortunately the DropOnDiagramSuccessPayload cannot encapsulate Message. Only failurePayload could display Message. 
But `org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.diagrams.handlers.DropOnDiagramEventHandler` return failure only if `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.emf.diagram.DiagramOperationInterpreter.executeTool(Tool, VariableManager)` return a failure. The DnD  AQL expression is evaluated with no error so there is no failure.

It would be interesting that DropOnDiagramSuccessPayload  can encapsulate Message to display to the user. For example, on EditTextField request, we can see that the successPayLoad can encapsulate Message (see screenShot).

Several successPayload could be completed with Message : 
- DropOnDiagramSuccessPayload 
- DeleteFromDiagramSuccessPayload
- SucessPayload from ReconnectEdgeEventHandler

It appears each time the IEditService tries to create a new instance in a mono containment reference feature that already contains a value. It can be reached either using the + icon on the widget reference or when using the _Create new element_ menu in the _Explorer_ view.

There is two solution to that problème.

1. Delete the previous value before adding the new one.

Something like this in _org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf.services.EditService.createObject(AdapterFactoryEditingDomain, EObject, CommandParameter)_

```java
  private Optional<Object> createObject(AdapterFactoryEditingDomain editingDomain, EObject eObject, CommandParameter commandParameter) {
        Optional<Object> objectOptional = Optional.empty();

        // NEW CODE START
        if (commandParameter.getEStructuralFeature() instanceof EReference ref && ref.isContainment() && !ref.isMany() && eObject.eGet(ref) != null) {
           delete(eObject.eGet(ref));
        }
        // NEW CODE HERE

        Command createChildCommand = CreateChildCommand.create(editingDomain, eObject, commandParameter, Collections.singletonList(eObject));
        editingDomain.getCommandStack().execute(createChildCommand);
        Collection<?> result = createChildCommand.getResult();
        if (result.size() == 1) {
            Object child = result.iterator().next();
            if (child instanceof EObject && EcoreUtil.isAncestor(eObject, (EObject) child)) {
                objectOptional = Optional.of(child);
            }
        }
        return objectOptional;
    }
```

This solution can be a bit hard on the delete element and its subtree

2. Send a message to the fronted to notify that the element can not be created because the feature is fulle

Something like this in _org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf.services.EditService.createObject(AdapterFactoryEditingDomain, EObject, CommandParameter)_

```java
  private Optional<Object> createObject(AdapterFactoryEditingDomain editingDomain, EObject eObject, CommandParameter commandParameter) {
        Optional<Object> objectOptional = Optional.empty();

        // NEW CODE START
        if (commandParameter.getEStructuralFeature() instanceof EReference ref && ref.isContainment() && !ref.isMany() && eObject.eGet(ref) != null) {
            this.feedbackMessageService
                    .addFeedbackMessage(new Message(""Unable to create a new instance of "" + commandParameter.getEValue().eClass().getName() + "" in "" + this.objectService.getLabel(eObject)
                            + "" in feature "" + commandParameter.getEStructuralFeature().getName() + "" because it has reach its upper bound cardinality."", MessageLevel.WARNING));
            return Optional.empty();
        }
        // NEW CODE END

        Command createChildCommand = CreateChildCommand.create(editingDomain, eObject, commandParameter, Collections.singletonList(eObject));
        editingDomain.getCommandStack().execute(createChildCommand);
        Collection<?> result = createChildCommand.getResult();
        if (result.size() == 1) {
            Object child = result.iterator().next();
            if (child instanceof EObject && EcoreUtil.isAncestor(eObject, (EObject) child)) {
                objectOptional = Optional.of(child);
            }
        }
        return objectOptional;
    }
```

### Expected behavior

From specific diagram, a root node Description is always displayed on the diagram and the user can only create element inside this root node description. If the user ""hide"" this root element and open the diagram several weeks later, he could be lost because its diagram will be empty and no tool will be available on the diagram. The user will not have the reflex to look at the list of hidden items.

Tools Hide and Fade should be removed from given node description to avoid this behavior. 
If user display tools on a node Description Hide and Fade tools should be absent. 

It could be driven from the DSL view with AQL precondition expression to explain when tools should be removed or some check box ""isHideToolDisplayed""/""isFadeToolDisplayed"".

### Cuttings backs

Checkbox are acceptable to simplify development.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a View Diagram Description
2. Create a Node Description
3. Check its default size

The problem with w1,h:1 as default size is that when the end user wants to test its view then the diagram doesn't show anything because 1,1 is too small.
The default value for nodes should be 150,70.

### Expected behavior

The default value for nodes should be 150,70.

### Actual behavior

The problem with w1,h:1 as default size is that when the end user wants to test its view then the diagram doesn't show anything because 1,1 is too small.

4. In the explorer, select the _standard_ DataFlow element inside _WiFi_: the selection is changed in the explorer and the _Details_ view, but *not* on the diagram (KO).
5. Select _WiFi_ again in the explorer, and then select on the edge connecting _WiFi_ to _DSP_. The ""standard"" DataFlow is correctly selected everywhere, which confirms that the edge is indeed representing the DataFlow element.

### Expected behavior

It should be interesting to have Documentation/description field on Node/edge description in the DSL view. This text field area could be used to explain the role of some node/edge description, its behavior... something like documentation tab in VSM from Sirius Desktop. 

### Cuttings backs

--

### Potential side effects

The DSL view could be a little more crowded.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

For now, some documentation is added in the developer guide of our application, but it will be more comfortable to have information in the DSL view.

### Expected behavior

The sirius-web frontend project contains a lot of things (index, modals, contributions, papaya, widgets...).

Developers who want to create a Sirius Web based application don't want all these things.

Developers who want to create a Sirius Web based application need a minimal `sirius-web` frontend module.

Thus, developers may create their own Sirius Web based application by creating their own `sirius-web` frontend module with a minimal effort.

### Cuttings backs

...

### Potential side effects

`sirius-web` frontend module will have a new dependency: `sirius-web-core` module.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

1. Create a (React Flow) diagram with (at least) two nodes _N1_ and _N2_ (which can not be dropped on each other);
2. Select _N1_ and hide it (using the ""hide"" tool in its palette). Remember its position/footprint before.
3. Select _N2_ and try to move it to a position that overlaps the footprint occupied by _N1_ before it was hidden.

**Expected result**: it should be possible to move _N2_ to said position, as it is visually ""free"".

**Actual result**: _N2_ is reset to its initial position.

This is because the node DnD code considers that the new request position overlaps a node which is not a compatible drop target, so it cancels the position change. Hidden nodes should not be considered when computing DnD targets & node overlaps.

When a node is moved only partially outside of its parent, we currently leave it there.

For rectangle/image/list nodes, this is voluntary as in such a case we want the parent to expand to include the new node's position (this will be handled as part of a more general work on node resize and overlap handling).

For list items however this never makes sense. It should be possible to DnD list items, but not to change their position inside their parent like this:

It's that React Flow de-selects the node, and *that* triggers the disappearance of the palette. In every node component we have somehting like:

```jsx
{selected ? <DiagramElementPalette diagramElementId={id} labelId={data.label ? data.label.id : null} /> : null}
```

But when it's the diagram that is selected, hiting ""Esc"" does not ""unselect"" anything.

So we got the expected behavior for elements ""for free"" but also by chance, and we need to do something specific for the case of the diagram.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2567,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2567,sirius-web,1991485630,2567,Fix the inconsistency in the typing of the custom widget API,sbegaudeau,422587,Stéphane Bégaudeau,,CLOSED,2023-11-13T21:06:32Z,2024-03-29T13:36:07Z,"In the API of the form property section, some parts of the API are relying on generics but they cannot possibly work. They appear to work because they have not been applied to existing property sections and the only place where they have been applied have very lax typeScript settings and thus pretty much anything would appear to ""work"". The issue comes from interfaces introduced for the support of custom widgets like `PropertySectionComponent` and `PropertySectionComponentProps`. They look nice with their generic signature but they do not really work. Here are the interfaces in question:

```
export type PropertySectionComponentProps<W extends GQLWidget> = {
  editingContextId: string;
  formId: string;
  widget: W;
  subscribers: GQLSubscriber[];
  readOnly: boolean;
  setSelection: (selection: Selection) => void;
};

export type PropertySectionComponent<W extends GQLWidget> = (
  props: PropertySectionComponentProps<W>
) => JSX.Element | null;
```

In `PropertySection.tsx`, we are not using generics at all because nothing in the existing API is based on generics so the type of `widget` is `GQLWidget`:

```
const CustomWidgetComponent = propertySectionsRegistry.getComponent(widget);
```

The property section registry is not leveraging generics in its function `getComponent` at all, which is the start of our problems:

```
export type PropertySectionComponentRegistry = {
  getComponent: (widget: GQLWidget) => PropertySectionComponent<GQLWidget> | null;
};
```

Which brings us to the code which reveals the issue:

```
const propertySectionsRegistry: PropertySectionComponentRegistry = {
  getComponent: (widget: GQLWidget) => {
    if (widget.__typename === 'Slider') {
      return SliderPropertySection;
    } else if (widget.__typename === 'ReferenceWidget') {
      return ReferencePropertySection;
    }
  }
}
```

Here, we can return a `SliderPropertySection` in case of a `SQLSlider` but the `SliderPropertySection` has to follow the signature of `PropertySectionComponent<W extends GQLWidget>`. As a result, its props have the type `PropertySectionComponentProps<GQLSlider>` which indicates that it can only work if it receives a `GQLSlider` but the signature of `PropertySectionComponentRegistry#getComponent` requires a `PropertySectionComponent<GQLWidget>` which would indicate that every single widget contributed using this API should have a props typed with `PropertySectionComponent<GQLWidget>` and not `PropertySectionComponent<W extends GQLWidget>`.

One could say that the fix is quite easy, the registry should be updated to have the following signature:

```
export type PropertySectionComponentRegistry = {
  getComponent: <Widget extends GQLWidget>(widget: Widget) => PropertySectionComponent<Widget> | null;
}
```

Unfortunately this does not work since we stumble on this error:

```
Type 'PropertySectionComponentProps<Widget>' is not assignable to type 'PropertySectionComponentProps<GQLSlider>'.
      Type 'Widget' is not assignable to type 'GQLSlider'.
        Type 'GQLWidget' is missing the following properties from type 'GQLSlider': minValue, maxValue, currentValue
```

And there starts a great adventure fighting TypeScript typing system with generics...","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2567/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

TypeScript cannot possibly work like Java. Unless proven otherwise, I think the API should change and remove generics because it is invalid.

If we were to move in this direction:

- The interface `PropertySectionComponent` should not use generics
- The interface `PropertySectionComponentProps` should not use generics either
- The code of our custom widgets should change to stop considering that `widget` can be a `GQLSlider` or a `GQLReferenceWidget` but instead a `GQLWidget`. This can be done with minimal impact on the existing code base with some sort of wrapper like this:

```
export const SliderWrapper = ({ widget, ...props }) => {
  if (isSlider(widget)) {
      return <Slider widget={widget} {...props} />;
  }
  return null;
}

The reconnection of an Edge on an incompatible source/target mapping is forbidden.

### Actual behavior

The reconnection of an Edge on an incompatible source/target mapping is allowed.
The backend raises an exception.

The fix should probably be done in `ReconnectEdgeEventHandler` or `ViewReconnectionToolsExecutor`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2587/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Until now, only tooltip is displayed when the cursor is over the tool section. Around twenty tool sections can sometimes be displayed on some diagram. Waiting for the display of tooltip is not really productive in this case. Moreover it is complicated to describe content of tool section with just few word.
It would be more convenient to automatically unfold the toolsection when the user cursor is over the tool section icon (ant not only the arrow)

- display tool section name close to the icon,

From full filled compartment, it will be useful to have some space after the last element of the list.
This space could be used to create an other element for example or to drag and drop something in the compartment when this one is full filled. Indeed, you cannot have the compartment palette tool from a full filled compartment because you always click on element from the compartment instead of the compartment. 
Goal : add free space left to access the tools for children creation.

### Steps to reproduce

1- Create a project and a representation with entity domain
2- Create entity1 and entity2 on the diagram
3- Close and open the diagram
4- Select entity1 from the explorer view : entity1 node is selected on diagram but no palette tool is displayed
5- Click on entity1 node from diagram 
6- Click on entity2 from explorer view : entity2 node is selected and palette tool appears

### Expected behavior

Palette tool should appear when entity1 is selected after opening the project and selected it from explorer view. 

### Actual behavior

Palette tool does not appear when entity1 is selected after opening the project and selected it from explorer view.

I strongly disagree on the expected behavior, here the user as not performed any interaction with the diagram, the palette should be closed if the selection is changed from the workbench, not opened on the second element.

Ok with the behavior that you describe. In this case, palette should not appear when I click on Entry2 from the Explorer (after clicking on entity1 node on diagram) because I click from Explorer so I do not interact with diagram","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5soxZH/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The useDropNode hook is responsible for several pieces of behavior related to dragging and dropping nodes. As a result of this complexity, it has many responsibilities which do not work properly.

- It contains a function named `onNodeDragStart` used by the `DiagramRenderer` to know which node is being dragged
- It contains a variable named `dropFeedbackStyleProvider` used by the various nodes to know how the style of the various nodes should be impacted
- It contains a GraphQL query used with `useQuery` to retrieve compatibility information

As a result of all those responsibilities, this hook is used at several location in the code such as:

- `DiagramRenderer`
- `ImageNode`
- `ListNode`
- `RectangularNode`
- `EllipseNode`

By the way, it seems a bit odd that it is not used in `IconLabelNode`...

With the multiplication of those responsibilities, the hook has now three ways to store pieces of informations with `setDropData`, `setDraggedNode` and `setDropNodeCompatibilityData`. The lifecycle of those individual pieces of state is invalid and creating bugs.

The multiplication of `useState` / `useContext` to store things here and there is creating very subtle issues.

#### Dragged node

If we were to inline the code of this hook to understand its impact a bit better, we have at least five locations in the code which are each storing what they think is the currently dragged node. So in memory, for a diagram displaying ""n"" nodes, we will have this information stored in ""n+1"" location and ""n"" of those will have the wrong information since only the instance of this hook used by the `DiagramRenderer` will be properly updated.

#### Compatibility query

We will also have ""n+1"" location trying to perform calls to `useQuery` to retrieve the compatibility data, ""n"" of those are useless since the query depends only the editing context id and the representation id.

### Solution

The hook `useDropNode` should be separated in smaller hooks with a proper lifecycle. The hook `useDropNode` should only be used by the `DiagramRenderer` and it should provide the following API:

```
export interface UseDropNodeValue {
  onNodeDragStart: NodeDragHandler;
  onNodeDrag: NodeDragHandler;
  onNodeDragStop: (onDragCancelled: (node: Node) => void) => NodeDragHandler;
  dropData: NodeDropData;
  diagramBackgroundStyle: DiagramBackgroundStyle;
}
```

- It should be the only one performing the retrieval of compatibility data
- It should not have any `useState<GQLDropNodeCompatibilityEntry[]>([])`, it's not necessary
- It should not have both a `DropNodeContext` and a ` useState<Node<NodeData> | null>(null)`, the `draggedNode` state should probably be removed since it's not necessary

A second hook, which would not perform any GraphQL query nor store any state named `useDropNodeStyle(nodeId: string)` should be introduced with the following API:

```
export interface useDropNodeStyleValue {
  style: React.CSSProperties
}
```

This hook should only request the relevant data from the `DropNodeContext`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2615/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Log something in the DiagramElementPalette or DiagramPalette composant.

### Expected behavior

When the palette is closed, we should not see any logs.

### Actual behavior

Since we're using the useViewport(); hook, the palette re renders when the viewport changes, meaning the palette gets re rendered a lot during a move.

### What to do

We should get the value of the viewport directly from the store instead of using the useViewport() hook.

Today, the navigation bar border color is the `theme.primary.main` color.
The navigation bar background color is the `theme.primary.secondary` color.
`theme.primary.main` and `theme.primary.secondary` colors are also used for many others parts in the UI.

An enhancement could be to add dedicated colors properties for the navigation colors in the Sirius Web theme.

In the first version of DnD, we considered a DnD to be ""in progress"" only when React Flow had called `onNodeDrag` on our node. See [here](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/commit/591ddb493cf4a5920a62370c72fbc0f0e69ac1bd#diff-304b6768613ae0428dba2ab4709d1f857ff8816e6a71020094c202cbedcc3d15L198) where we set `draggedNodeId` to `null` in `onNodeDragStart` and only set it to `node.id` in `onNodeDrag`.

After the refactoring done in https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/pull/2620 we now consider a DnD to be ""in progress"" as soon as React Flow calls `onDragStart`. However this happens even on a plain click to select a node without moving. `onDragStop` is called when the mouse is released.

The consequence is that when clicking on a node, we temporarily fade all nodes which are note compatible drop targets, which causes ""flickering"" on the diagram.

The integration tests of the `sirius-web-persistence` module need a running Docker to launch a containerized PostgreSQL database.

Check https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ for installation instructions for your OS.

You can also pass `-DskipTests` to the Maven invocation so that the tests are ignored if you do not want (or can not) install Docker.

I want to upload the metamodel EMF and the system allows to:
1. Create a new model instance from metamodel 
2. Upload a new existing model
3. Edit model 

In attachments the files obtained from Eclipse Epsilon:
- the metamodel (.ECORE and its diagrams rappresentation)
- One example model created from metamodel

### Actual behavior

The metamodel doesn't load.

While part of the issue may come from our new integration with ReactFlow, the fact that the diagram panel can take a couple seconds to be displayed makes me believe that something may be going on on the backend side of the application.

The first goal of this issue is to ensure that we have the proper monitoring capabilities, based on on micrometer on the backend, in order to evaluate the time spent on the various steps of the following use cases:

- with a simple syson project, when I open an empty diagram, then I want the diagram to be loaded quickly
- with a simple syson project, when I switch from one diagram to another (after more than six seconds on the current diagram), then I want the diagram to be loaded quickly

The following steps should be monitored to have some timing data:

- loading of the editing context event processor
- loading of the diagram event processor
- refresh of the representation
- sending the diagram refresh event payload to the frontend
- time to process each input (to detect that an input is being processed while another one has been sent)
- rendered of the diagram on the frontend (using something like console.log on the frontend)

We should be able to retrieve monitoring data from an instance of syson running locally using prometheus and grafana and after that monitor how things are running on the real demo instance on AWS. Once we will have those data, we will see how to proceed to fix the issues detected.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2784/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In order to be usable from pretty much anywhere, all monitoring code should be located in `sirius-components-core`. Using this pseudo-code, we should be able to log various kind of measurements that have occurred while using a diagram. Contrary to my example, it will be critical to be able to keep the correlation id in mind for the relevant tasks (diagram refreshed event payload + layout + new diagram refreshed event payload).

The goal of this task is not to build a massive monitoring system, but just to setup the relevant bricks to be able to monitor various things in the frontend. This code should be as simple as possible.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5uPacP/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to reproduce

Open a diagram and click on button ""Export to SVG"" from the main toolbar. 

### Expected behavior

The SVG image should be usable without any browser.

### Actual behavior

It exists  ""Export to SVG"" action in the main toolbar on reactflow diagrams. This action export the diagram in SVG. While the SVG image can be opened with a browser to display the diagram, the SVG image is not usable outside of  a browser. For example, if user opens the SVG image with inkscape or if he wants to insert image in document, the result is a blank image because of html content inside the SVG image.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2807/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This tree is defined by a list of roots (using _IReferenceWidgetRootCandidateSearchProvider_ service) and the type of the target. This might not be enough in some use cases.
For example, the candidates might need to match an extra criterion to be selectable.

### Expected behavior

It could be great if in the widget description we could define the tree to be displayed in the modal.
For example, by creating the ""treeId"" using an expression. That would allow the user to create its own tree or define its own ""isSelectable"" expression.

To avoid duplicating code from _org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.widget.reference.browser.ModelBrowsersDescriptionProvider_ it could be great to extract method _org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.widget.reference.browser.ModelBrowsersDescriptionProvider.getModelBrowserDescription(String, Predicate<VariableManager>, Function<VariableManager, Boolean>, Function<VariableManager, List<?>>)_ in its own class. So it would be easy to create a _basic_ tree and only customize the _selectableProvider_.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

In the use cases we have for now, we only need to customize the _isSelectable_ feature. So it could be possible to only provide this by an expression. However, it gives less extension capabilities.

### Actual behavior

Currently `sirius-web-sample-application` owns a lot of spring `@Configuration`. It implies dependencies to every representation and various meta-models.(charts, diagram, gantt, deck etc)

### Expected behavior

We should split those configuration and put them in starter module so that an application would have just to choose the starter

Example  of Gantt & Deck:

`ViewGanttDescriptionBuilder` is an example of Gantt view which depends on Gantt and Task meta-model
Gantt and Deck should be used independantly from the Task meta-model and independantly from each other
Using Task for Gantt or Deck should not imply respectively the usage of Deck or Gantt

For such reasons we could imagine having 
* a module containing the Bean for Task
* a module, depending on gantt(`sirius-components-view-gantt` `sirius-components-view-gantt-edit` , `sirius-components-XXX-gantt`, containing for example the Bean for view Gantt (EPackage, AdapterFactory) and ViewGanttConverter (that convert view modele to POJO description)
* a module, depending of the two previous, containing the Bean for the Gantt stereotype that uses `ViewGanttDescriptionBuilder`

* Diagrams have [`ShareDiagramDialog`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/diagrams/frontend/sirius-components-diagrams-reactflow/src/renderer/ShareDiagramDialog.tsx)
* Gantt have [`ShareGanttModal.tsx`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/gantt/frontend/sirius-components-gantt/src/share-gantt/ShareGanttModal.tsx) which is very similar but takes the URL to share as a prop instead of hard-coding the use of `window.location.href`.
* Portals and Deck representation will need one.
* Forms should also probably have one, but they currently do not have a toolbar where to place it.

Anyway, there is nothing specific to the nature of the representation shared in this modal, so it would be better to have a single common implementation.

In addition, the use of `window.location.href` (either hard-coded or passed as a prop) will soon become incorrect. For representations embedded inside a portal, sharing the representation should not share the current URL, which is the portal's URL.

Proposed interface for the shared implementation:

```js
export interface ShareRepresentationModalProps {
  editingContextId: string;
  representationId: string;
  onClose: () => void;
}
```

The URL shared would need to be computed from `editingContextId` and `representationId`.
The issue is that this mapping between `editingContextId` and `representationId` on one side and the URL on the other side is defined in `sirius-web-application/src/router/Router.tsx` at the application level.

### Expected behavior

Today, the way the node descriptions of a diagram description are retrieved through GraphQL may lead to performance issues since it may call a lot of events from the `DiagramEventProcessor`. Indeed each child/border node is retrieved through an event.

It should be possible to change the way the node descriptions of a diagram description are retrieved to only have one event retrieving all node descriptions.

### Steps to reproduce
All bigs models in the ModelExplorer will allow to reproduce this issue


### Expected behavior
The bottom scrollbar should be visible when required AND whatever the position of the vertical scrollbar


### Actual behavior

Some success payload can now contain messages to display to the user, while some other don't. It could be interesting to uniformize this behavior and let the specifier push log messages to the user on all the requests.

In our project we specifically need to embed a message in the response of this request: `getConnectorTools`. In our use case we'd like to show a message to the user when he/she attempts to create an edge between two elements that cannot be connected together.

Note: this issue is also related to https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2732: the messages added to the success payloads should also be displayed to the end user.

* [x] **I have checked that this feature has not yet been suggested by someone else.**

### Expected behavior
The message set via the `ServiceLogger` is added to the payload and displayed to the end user.

### Potential side effects


### Describe alternatives you've considered
Supporting message for `getConnectorTools` success payload would solve our current issue, but we may have similar issues with other payloads in the future.

This service has been improved multiple time to handle more complex use cases over time. As an example, it loads all view models to resolve proxies or it supports the static view model containing the default color palette. On the other hand, the `ViewRepresentationDescriptionSearchService` can end up loading one view document straight from the database without any support for those features. It ends up creating EMF resources with proxies which cannot be resolved.

As a result, several features ends up being broken such as the support for drag and drop since we have proxies:

### Expected behavior

Users want to store and have access to read only data (a.k.a libraries).
Users should be able to click on a template/project and have in their projects a set of documents with objects referencing objects from libraries.

### Cuttings backs

In a first iteration, the objects from libraries and the libraries will not be visible by default in Sirius Web UI.

### Expected behavior

Actually handles to create new edge from a Node can be overlap by an edge such described in the following screenshot.

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/24290600/db195168-16f7-410f-8686-a0f44b6c36b0)

This overlay create two problems : 
* a user can interpret the handle on the edge like an arrow to describe direction of stream
* if user wants to create a new edge from an handle on existing edge, he cannot because when he click on this area, the reconnect action of existing edge is chosen.

Some solutions appear to figure out this problem but they are not satisfying : 
* handle can be drown inside the node but in this case, they can overlap existing subnodes and on border node, it won't be convenient
* we can play with Z-index to put forward the handle except when an edge is selected, in this case existing edge is put forward to authorize re-connection,
* shape of handle could be change in arrow more flattened and longer. In this case, the handle will not be compared to an arrow and the area to click on handle will be more important.

I do not know what is the best solution but it is a real drawback.

### Potential side effects

According to project, solution could be bad

### Expected behavior

When two nodes overlap, graphical Drag&Drop should be able to chose the good container.
In the following example, it is not possible to the user to Drag&Drop the comment in Package2 node (we can overlap node with creation tool or resize tool).

I suppose that when two nodes overlap, the deepest node is chosen. 

User should be able to chose other container than the  deepest target node.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Disable all overlap behaviors (but probably not a good idea since overlap could be authorize with an option in futur)

### Expected behavior

When user try to create an edge between node, DSL view use ""Target element descriptions"" field to fade not authorized target. In some case, we need more. 

User should be able to not create an edge between node N_A (representing an element E_A) and a node N_B (representing an element E_B) by using some condition on elements E_A and E_B even if nodes N_A and N_B are not fad.
We should have some precondition filed to check information on source and target. This field could be checked just before displaying edge palette when user releases the click on target. If precondition on edge is not to true, the edge is not displayed in the palette (with maybe a message to warn user why the edge is not here). Other authorized edge are displayed.

### Cuttings backs

None message could be displayed when an edge is finally not authorized, it could be driven by the project.

### Potential side effects

When no edge are available, nothing is done. Without any message, it could be confusing. 
Be careful with performance degradation.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

It would be wonderful if precondition can be take into account during ""fade"" computation without any performance degradation.

### Expected behavior

When user hide a compartment from container, result is the same than the one using collapse action (see https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2846).
Besides, when we hide a compartment, followings one are jumped up one spot. With this behavior, there is empty space after the last compartment. Visually, with this empty space, user  always see the initial number of compartment. If he opens his diagram few weeks later, he will try to create element in compartment without understanding why it does not work as usually. After hiding compartment, there is nothing to warn user that there is a compartment hidden.
When all compartment are hidden, the container node  looks like a container node with FreeFormLayoutStrategy. User will try to Drag&Drop something inside.

![hideCompartment](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/24290600/fe29f204-bc73-49bc-b752-53d3da964ffb)

I think it could be interesting to remove empty space after hiding a compartment or it could be interesting to add decorator or at least reduce empty space to show that something has happened. 

### Potential side effects

Decorators is weird since it does not exist anymore in Sirius Web 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I do not know if there is a meaning to hide compartment if we can collapse them.

![Capture d’écran du 2024-01-19 09-52-06](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/10608/07337c3d-43cd-4728-a901-2a2df243188f)

Also note the 3 ""Récupération mineure"" blocks (minor GC collections).

IconOverlay uses parameterized styles:

```
const useStyles = makeStyles<Theme, IconOverlayStyleProps>((_theme) => ({
  iconContainer: {
    position: 'relative',
    width: ({ iconWidth }) => `${iconWidth}px`,
    height: ({ iconHeight }) => `${iconHeight}px`,
  },
  icon: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
  },
}));
```
My guess is that this creates a *lot* of garbage objects on large diagrams (with hundreds/thousands of labels), which end up triggering GC several times.

Hard-coding the styles to:
```
const useStyles = makeStyles<Theme>((_theme) => ({
  iconContainer: {
    position: 'relative',
    width: `16px`,
    height: `16px`,
  },
  icon: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
  },
}));
```

seem to reduce the performance issue. It's still not immediate to move an element on a large papaya diagram, but the performance does not seem to degrade anymore.

The feedback is correct. It is just that when dropping the represensation, it is displayed so that there is no space between the dropped represenation and the top of the portal representation.
But for me, we can consider that as expected.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a flow project with a Topography diagram
2. Create a composite processor anywhere in the diagram (to have a standard)
3. Increase the left panel width
4. Click anywhere in the diagram (see results)
5. Click on the node creation tool (see results)

### Expected Result

4. The palette is displayed where the user has clicked
5. The node is created where the palette was

### Actual Result

4. The palette is displayed with an offset from where the user has clicked.
5. The node may be created with an offset from where the palette was.

I'm starting to believe that we are ""this close"" from being able to drag and drop things between representations without issues 😛

### Screenshots

### Steps to reproduce
Currently, multiple warnings of the kind `React does not recognize the X prop on a DOM element` are logged when opening a Deck representation.
This seems to be related to the fact that react-trello passes props through children components by using {...props}.
We should modify react-trello on Obeonetwork to destructure props before passing it to the children.

### Expected behavior

Today, specifiers can declare a set of operations (the body) on a reference widget (like most of other widgets). These operations are executed on a click on a selected item in the reference widget.

The click action is not really used and we can't provide a custom behavior on set/add operations.

So I suggest to modify this behavior, by executing the body on set/add actions instead of the click one.
If no body operations are provided, then the default (i.e. the current) behavior on set/add operations will apply.

### Cuttings backs

...

### Potential side effects

Existing Body operations, today bind to click action will be now bind to set/add operations, so there will be potential side effects for existing Form Views.

Hi guys,

During the building of the frontend section, I encountered an error. Unfortunately, I haven't found a solution yet (I am using Windows; it worked on Linux). Has anyone else faced this error?

### Expected behavior

When the border node is not represented by a square shape, rotative border node should works and it should still display the border node on its border. 

### Actual behavior 

When using a rectangular image shape, the border node does not follow exactly the border of the node, maybe there are some constraints because of handle that are fixed.

### Cuttings backs

No Cuttings backs

### Potential side effects

Handle should be computed when the border node rotates so maybe some performance problem.

In `ComposedObjectService.getObject(IEditingContext, String)` we do:

```java
    @Override
    public Optional<Object> getObject(IEditingContext editingContext, String objectId) {
        var optionalDelegate = this.objectServiceDelegates.stream()
                .filter(delegate -> delegate.canHandle(editingContext))
                .findFirst();
        if (optionalDelegate.isPresent()) {
            return optionalDelegate.get().getObject(editingContext, objectId);
        }
        return this.defaultObjectService.getObject(editingContext, objectId);
    }
```

If E1 and E2 want to have any chance to get their `getObject(editingContext, objectId)` method called, they currently *must* return `true` to `canHandle(editingContext)`. However, when this is the case the ""first"" (on the order Spring will decide to inject them) which is found by `ComposedObjectService` will be the only one invoked. If it's E1, it can resolve its own objects and the defaults (by extending `DefaultObjectService`) but  will not know about potential other objects that E2 would be able to resolve, and E2 will never be called (until maybe the next reboot if it is injected before E1 this time).

One option would be for `IObjectServiceDelegate.canHandle(IEditingContext)` to also take the `String objectId` as it is the ""guard method"" for `getObject(IEditingContext editingContext, String objectId)` and `getContents(IEditingContext editingContext, String objectId)`. However this means that to answer this more precise question, `canHandle(IEditingContext, String)` some (most? all?) implementations will need to actully try to resolve the designated object just to return `true` and then be called again via `getObject(IEditingContext, String)` and re-do the same work. And a third and fourth time in the (relatively common) case where the next step will be to invoke `getContents()`:

1. canHandle(editinContext, objectId) => resolve the objectId, return true if found
2. getObject(editinContext, objectId) => resolve the objectId, this time to return it
3. canHandle(editinContext, objectId) => resolve the objectId, return true if found
4. getContents(editinContext, objectId) => resolve the objectId, this time to return its children

Another option would be to remove `IObjectServiceDelegate.canHandle(IEditingContext)`, leverage the fact that `IObjectServiceDelegate.getObject()` returns an optional and change `IObjectServiceDelegate.getContents()` to return an `Optional<List<Object>>` and return the first non-empty result from all the known delegates.

Another possible change (somewhat orthogonal to the above) would be to change `getContents(IEditingContext editinContext, String objectId)` into `getContents(IEditingContext editinContext, Object object)`. In the common case where we invoke `getContents` in a context where we have already resolved the objectId this would avoid some duplicate work. A default implementation could be added to `IObjectService[Delegate]` for compatibility:

```java
  // New method, takes an already resolved object
  List<Object> getContents(IEditingContext editingContext, Object object);

  // Old method, takes the id if that's all we have and resolve it first
  default List<Object> getContents(IEditingContext editingContext, String objectId) {
    return this.getObject(editingContext, String objectId).map(this::getContents).orElse(List.of());
  }
```

- I think that the getContents method should only take the `Object object`, I'm not sure we need to give it back the editing context

I think I talked about this with Axel when we discussed future improvements in order to split the `IObjectService` interface into multiple smaller ones. I did started this work but it's currently a work in progress on a local branch on my machine. It is relevant for the extensibility of Sirius Web but it had a lower priority than other key architectural issues.

If you need as a quick fix, to had something like `objectId` to canHandle and change `getContents` to take the object just go for it, I'll make the split into smaller interfaces later. From my analysis the last time I worked on it, we could simply switch to `getContents(Object object)` without issues, unless I'm mistaken, just break the existing interface and change the signature, we will break it even further ""soon"" with the split.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc5yO3fq/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is not ideal, but sufficient for me to move on with other issues revealed by #2890 on my own branch.
The new APIs that will replace `IObjectService` being developed in #3042 should solve this whole issue. Depending on what needs to be merged first, the changes proposed here to the current `IObjectService` may never need to be done.

```java
VariableManager variableManager = new VariableManager();
variableManager.put(VariableManager.SELF, this.formCreationParameters.getObject());
```
In other words, the `self` element on which the `FormRenderer` will be invoked will always be the initial object passed when the form was initialy created.

This works ""by mistake"" in the standard case where this `self` object is a mutable `EObject`: each render sees the same object, but each time in the correct/expected state.

However this breaks when the target object is immutable, and a new, different Java object is used to represent the successive states of that object (with the same id). For example when [creating a Form on the content of a Portal representation](#2890). In such a case, the `FormEventProcessor` will always render the same `Form` on every refresh as the original object from `formCreationParameters` is immutable.

Diagrams solve this (not sure that was exactly on purpose) by re-resolving the target object from its id on every refresh:
```java
var optionalObject = this.objectService.getObject(editingContext, previousDiagram.getTargetObjectId());
```

Forms (and other representations which may have the issue) should do the same.

Not an issue in practice when these are mutable EObjects, each refresh sees the current state, but in general this can be a problem when the target object it immutable.
Other representations avoid this by re-resolving the target object from its id on each refresh to make sure they see the current version.

One approach outlined in #3023 would be to handle specifically this behavior in by changing how `IDanglingRepresentationDeletionService` works. This would fix this particular unwanted behavior but feels ad-hoc.

Another approach, implemented here, is to consider at the _core_ of the framework, that representations can be considered as ""objects"" (as seen by `IObjectService`).
This would also fix the issue mentioned above, and remove the need for other ""hacks"" (i.e. in `RepresentationsEventProcessorFactory`, resolving the `targetObjectId` with either `IObjectService` _or_, explicitly, with `IRepresentationSearchService`).
Conceptually it also feels like a more ""satisfying"" approach as it removes a disctinction between ""semantic elements"" on one side and ""representations"" on the other.
However because it changes a rather fundamental assumption in the system, it can have some hard to predict side effects.

### Screenshots

...

### Steps to reproduce

The direct edit (F2) is working the first time but if the lane stay selected (for example after escape) then a new F2 doesn't trigger direct edit.
That is probably caused by the focus lost and the keyDown event is not captured by the lane header. 
...

### Expected behavior
If a Lane is still selected, pressing F2 should trigger the lane title direct edit in any cases.

### Actual behavior

### Expected behavior

Actually, user can display overlapped edges and the diagram is no longer readable (mainly when user export it in word for example). It is difficult to identify what is the source or the target of given edge.

It should be interesting to have the capacity to manipulate edges by shifting it in these moments.

### Potential side effects

Maybe customers will someday ask to have the capacity of overlapping edges to represent inheritance between class for example. It should work.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

We do not allow the overlap of edge (but it is not a good idea, let see potential side effects).

We tend to pass them as props.
This is particularly visible in `FormDescriptionEditor` where Page, PageList, ToolbarActions, WidgetEntry, etc. all drill down `editingContextId={editingContextId} representationId={representationId}` and would need to also drill down `readOnly` to support #2999.

In React Flow diagrams, we have introduced `DiagramContext` so that different components can do a simple
```
const { editingContextId, diagramId } = useContext<DiagramContextValue>(DiagramContext);
```
instead of drilling down these as props.

This could be generalized into a `const { editingContextId, representationId, readOnly } = useRepresentation();` hook.
These 3 properties correspond to `RepresentationComponentProps`.
The context could be setup by the workbench [where it instanciates the appropriate `RepresentationComponent`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/core/frontend/sirius-components-core/src/workbench/Workbench.tsx#L177).
It should also be used/setup by Portal and FormBasedView (and maybe others).

### Expected behavior

When edge has start and end label, these labels can overlap the source/target label of edge. In this case, labels are not readable.

The only way to make it readable is to move the source or the target in order to connect the edge on an other border of the source/target with no label.

It could be interesting to forbidden overlap of start/end label on other label (as done on figure here : https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2760).

### Potential side effects

Start/end label can be far away from their connection point on the border.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Alternative 1 : Edge could stop connection just before label (and not at the border)
Alternative 2 : User could be able to manipulate label such as moving it like a node.

### Expected behavior

Sirius Web does not have an undo/redo mechanism yet.
When an element has been deleted, either from the Explorer view, from any representation, or any other view, there is no way to retrieve it.
All delete actions are executable in one click.
Any accidental click on a delete action can lead to the unwanted loss of data.
By extension, some one-click actions may lead to unwanted consequences.

A confirmation dialog should be displayed when a delete action (click on the delete tool on a node, click on DEL key on a node, click on the delete menu item on an object in the Explorer view) has been called.
This dialog should avoid or drastically minimized unwanted loss of data.
This dialog should have the possibility to be disabled.

== Context

Sirius Web contains a set of transient representations which are not as connected to the Sirius Components architecture as persistent representations.
As a result, it is difficult to obtain both the metadata and the description of a transient representation.

== Decision

We should be able to find the description of any transient representation.
For that, we will introduce a dedicated service to find them.

```
package org.eclipse.sirius.web.services.api.representations;

public interface ITransientRepresentationMetadataSearchService {
    Optional<RepresentationMetadata> findById(String editingContextId, String representationId);
}
```

```
package org.eclipse.sirius.web.services.representations;

@Service
public class TransientRepresentationMetadataSearchService implements ITransientRepresentationMetadataSearchService {
    public Optional<RepresentationMetadata> findById(String editingContextId, String representationId) {
        // hardcoded metadata for explorer, validation, details, representations, related elements
    }
}
```

We could then use this service in the `EditingContextRepresentationDataFetcher` in order to retrieve the metadata of the transient representations.

After that, we should be able to find the description of said transient representations in `EditingContext#getRepresentationDescriptions` as for any representation descriptions. For that, the editing context should be populated with the various representation descriptions when it is loaded.

== Status

Work in progress

== Consequences

We should update the behavior of `EditingContextRepresentationDataFetcher` in the future to extract it in a dedicated service `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService` which should look in either the `ITransientRepresentationMetadataSearchService` or in the database to find the metadata. I don't see why we should look in the editing context event processor with both solutions, as it is inefficient performance wise and can provide unsynchronized information.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3102/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

With Portal, the deck's card or lane feedback is shifted during the Drag n drop.
This is due to the way react-trello (by using the react-smooth-dnd component) is handling the feedback:
The feedback is a copy of the initial dom element with a position:fixed. The issue with that is that when a transform property exists in one of the parent, the top and left values used for positioning the feedback are relative to the ancestor with the transform property. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position for more details.

Since 2024.1.0, we depend on this node package (@ObeoNetwork/react-trello) that comes from github node artifacts repository.
So you should probably add a `$HOME/.npmrc` file with the following content:
`//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=$YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
Indeed, as for the backend part (maven), we need a github token to read modules from github node artifact repository.
I will update the build instructions, thank you.

1. In this case, the Hide action should be forbidden on the Link and on the Note and should be available only for the DecisionNode itself. 
2. In this case, the Hide action on the DecisionNode should also Hide the Link and the Note

Try to create an edge from a side where a border node is attached.

### Actual behavior

* An edge could cross completely its border node to link an other node whereas other side are available to be source of edge. This is confusing for user who could think that the source is the border node.
* An edge could cross the container node of the border node when this on is the target.

### Expected behavior
The Property View framework allows to the user to navigate easily from an element to another one. For example, with UML, the user can do these things:
* Create a Class named _Class1_ in the diagram, then from the Property View
    * Create a Property _p1_ inside this class
    * type this Property creating a new Class _Class2_
    * set _Class2_ as abstract (for example), then the user want to return to _Class1_ easily to create new Operation inside it. 

Currently, the user need to reselect _Class1_ inside the Diagram or inside the ModelExplorer. We think that Sirius-Web should propose a back button to the Property View to return to the previous edited page.

### Expected behavior
Currently, Sirius-Web only allows to provide icon everytime or never for a given mapping. In Papyrus-Web, we would like to have conditionnal icon, in order to be able to display an icon only when the element has a label. 

At this moment, as this feature is missing, our links never have icons in papyrus-Web.

This means it's only possible for tools implemented with custom Java code.

It should be possible to provide a standard Java service provider to expose the equivalent of this Spring service to AQL expressions. Something like:

```
public class FeedbackServices {
    private IFeedbackMessageService service;
    public FeedbackServices(IFeedbackMessageService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
    public EObject info(EObject self, String message) {
        this.service.addFeedbackMessage(new Message(message, MessageLevel.INFO));
        return self;
    }
    public EObject warning(EObject self, String message) {
        this.service.addFeedbackMessage(new Message(message, MessageLevel.WARNING));
        return self;
    }
    public EObject error(EObject self, String message) {
        this.service.addFeedbackMessage(new Message(message, MessageLevel.ERROR));
        return self;
    }
}

Then a purely View-based tool defined entirely from the web can do `aql:self.info('It worked')`.

Of course the namin/API design should probably be different from the above, it's just to be taken as an illustration.

### Expected behavior
A new _Is Collapsed By Default Expression_  is visible in the properties of NodeDescriptions.
This field accepts boolean expressions, where `true` means collapsed, and `false` means expanded.
This expression is evaluated to collapse/expand a node on its first rendering,
The field is empty by default, which means expanded (this preserves Sirius Web's current behavior to expand new nodes by default).

### Expected behavior
Specifiers should be able to collapse/expand nodes as part of their tools (e.g. expand a container when a child node is created).
A new `diagramServices` variable is available and can be used to collapse/expand nodes from AQL expressions and Java services.

```aql
aql:diagramServices.collapse(Sequence{selectedNode})
```

```java
private IDiagramServices diagramServices;

public EObject doStuff(Diagram previousDiagram, EObject eObject, IDiagramServicesContext diagramServicesContext) {
  diagramServices.collapse(diagramServicesContext, previousDiagram.getNodes());
  return eObject;
}
```

### Potential side effects
The `diagramServices` variable could be extended in the future with other diagram-related services (pin, hide, etc).

### Describe alternatives you've considered
- Create a new Operation that can be added in the Tool's body. Moved to a service-based solution because this approach doesn't work well with Java services.

The direct edit and trash icon does not use the same color as the other tools (Hide, Fade, Pin, Resize)

### Steps to reproduce
Open any palette tool

### Expected behavior

The standard tool should use the ""primary"" color of the CSS template.

### Analysis:

The tools that use and incorrect color are provided by the backend. The fronted uses a ```<img>``` tag to display the icon for those tools.

```html
<div class=""makeStyles-toolSection-207"">
  <div class=""makeStyles-tool-210"" data-testid=""Edit - Tool"">
    <div style=""position: relative; width: 16px; height: 16px"">

It appears that it is not possible to use a color defined in the application in an SVG that is not inlined.
If we try to set the color in the SVG using _currentColor_ it seems that is has not effect.

```html

In a simple use case, it seems also impossible to set the style to be used to render an SVG in the ``img`` tag.

I think the following article says it is a constraint of SVG use in ``img`` tag: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web

A workaround for this use case to work would be to inline the SVG inside the ``IconOverlay`` component if the iconURL is an SVG.

For this we could either create a custom React component that fetch the content of the SVG and inlines it or use a existing library:

Indeed, SVG retrieved from a link are indeed sandboxed from the CSS of the rest of the page. There nothing we can do about that limitation but we still have couple of options to fix the issue.

### Use the proper color in the backend

We could simply change the color used in the SVG in the backend but it would not work for those who will customize that part of the theme of the frontend.

### Move those SVGs to the frontend

One option would be to keep all those static SVGs on the frontend in `sirius-components-diagrams` for those in questions. It would solve that issue but the issue would still appear if someone tried to add custom icons for their diagram tools and if they wanted to use the standard palette.

### Control the theme on the backend

This is not the first feature where we would need to have access to the theme on the backend of the application. Since most of the theme is serializable, it could easily be downloaded by the frontend when the application is starting up. By having the theme on the backend, we could thus give the runtime / specifiers access to the theme to compute stuff such as icons with proper color but also the default color palette in a studio etc.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc54b_OI/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Charts are currently only used in the context of forms via `ChartWidgetComponent`, which computes a `targetObjectId`, so the `IChart` representation itslef could be passed the `targetObjectId` and become a full `ISemanticRepresentation` easily.

For Validation and Tree, there is no semantic element that can serve a the target object.
The most obvious (and maybe the only) value would by the `editingContextId`.

In the same way that we needed to make `IObjectService` aware of representations (in #3066) it should probably be made ""editing context aware"", i.e. `IIdentityService.getId()` and `IObjectSearchService.getObject()` should work when passed an `IEditingContext` or its id.

- User wants to upload a document.
A new `download report` button is available in the `Upload new model` modal.
It is disabled.
- Specifier has provided a report provider for this kind of document.
- Once the document uploaded, the modal is not automatically closed (unlike the current behavior).
The new `download report` button is now enabled, allowing to download the report as a text file.
The `upload` button is now disabled, because the upload is finished.
A new `close` button has also been add to the modal allowing to close the modal.

### Expected behavior
The palette provides additional hide/reveal options for nodes that contain other nodes. These options are visible in a dropdown under the ""Hide"" button. The image below shows some examples we could have (names aren't definitive):
![hide menu](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/6516281/768a377b-cbd8-4327-9a08-4227c7bdcf65)

- `Hide`: hides the selected element, same behavior as the current hide tool
- `Hide All`: hides all the direct children of the selected element (does the same thing as a collapse)
- `Show All`: reveals all the direct children of the selected element
- `Show Default`: reveals the direct children that have a `Is Hidden By Default` expression set to `false` (see #3371)
- `Show Valued`: reveals the direct children that contain elements

This would allow to reveal only a subset of hidden elements, which is not possible right now via the ""Reveal Hidden Elements"" tool on the diagram's palette.

In our use case we need such tools to hide/reveal compartments inside nodes, but the solution should work for any kind of node/layout.


### Cuttings backs
...

### Potential side effects
The ""Hide"" tool is currently defined in the frontend, we may want to change that and integrate it in `ViewPaletteProvider#createExtraToolSections` and `CompatibilityPaletteProvider#createExtraToolSections`.

New handlers/mutations may be required to implement some hide/reveal operations.

### Describe alternatives you've considered
We can achieve this behavior with NodeTools relying on the hide/reveal services, but this feature seems generic enough to be integrated in Sirius Web.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3382/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Expected behavior
Specifiers can define tools and add them to tool sections automatically created in the palette (delete/hide/fade).
This complements #3382 and would allow to define diagram-specific hide/reveal tools (e.g. ""Show compartment XXX"") and have them displayed alongside the other hide/reveal tools:

![contribute hide tools](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/6516281/932343bb-edf7-43d2-b06c-36c3ae3c2002)

Elements in red are default tools detailed in #3382
Elements in green are specific tools contributed by the specifier


### Potential side effects
This opens tool sections of the palette that weren't accessible to specifiers.

### Describe alternatives you've considered
I am not sure what's the best approach to do this, but I have considered the following:
- A name-based approach to merge user-defined tool sections with default ones (e.g. a user can create a ""hide"" tool section and its tools will be contributed to the default ""hide"" one)
- A ""Palette Post Processor"" service that can add/remove elements from the palette once it has been computed (this could help fix #2461 and #3176)

Please let me know if you have a suggestion on the best way to achieve this.

<img width=""513"" alt=""Capture d’écran 2024-04-15 à 00 17 07"" src=""https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/422587/9af25bde-6f6e-4406-b31f-6ecea11af96d"">

We should probably just continue by adding there a Show / Fade / Hide tool section with a default tool for show and hide. The currently hardcoded tools ""show"" and ""hide"" would just become default tools created in the view DSL (just like the delete and direct edit ones currently). I think the bast solution would be to stop having ANY tool hardcoded in the frontend and have them all computed from the diagram description.

You could start moving on this issue by removing the fact that the tools for show / hide / fade are hardcoded in the palette and make them computed from the diagram description (don't forget to consider removing their dedicated data fetchers too s they make no sense) and we could move forward with this by removing the hardcoded tools and data fetchers for expand, collapse, pin, unpin too later. This way specifiers would be able to remove default tools, replace them, add a condition on them, change their behavior or organize them in tool section as they desire.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc56cKU9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Screenshots

...

### Steps to reproduce

In Sirius-web, the shape field of the `ImageNodeStyleDescription` references a custom image uploaded on the server and stored in the  database. The `ImageController` uses the `/custom/` prefix on this image path to know if the image should be retrieved from the database.

But in the context of a spring server based on sirius-component but not Sirius-web, we might use the shape field to store a path to a static resource for instance. Since the `/custom/`prefix is added by sirius-component, we have to deal with it in the ImageController even if the custom image mechanism is not used.

The prefix is added by the ImageNodeStyleProvider :

```java
else if (nodeType.equals(Optional.of(NodeType.NODE_IMAGE))) {
            iNodeStyle = Optional.of(ImageNodeStyle.newImageNodeStyle()
                    .scalingFactor(1)
                    .imageURL(""/custom/"" + ((ImageNodeStyleDescription) nodeStyle).getShape())
                    .borderColor(Optional.ofNullable(nodeStyle.getBorderColor())
                            .filter(FixedColor.class::isInstance)
                            .map(FixedColor.class::cast)
                            .map(FixedColor::getValue)
                            .orElse(DEFAULT_COLOR))
                    .borderSize(nodeStyle.getBorderSize())
                    .borderStyle(LineStyle.valueOf(nodeStyle.getBorderLineStyle().getLiteral()))
                    .borderRadius(nodeStyle.getBorderRadius())
                    .positionDependentRotation(((ImageNodeStyleDescription) nodeStyle).isPositionDependentRotation())
                    .build());
        }
```



...

### Expected behavior

The `/custom/`  prefix should not be added by sirius-component but probably directly in the ImageNodeStyleDescription at creation time (in the studio or programmatically when using the view builder).

A new `DateTime` form widget will be created.
It will be compliant to any generic behavior of a form widget.

### Expected behavior

The diagram panel has a new icon that shows a tree representing the content of the diagram when clicked.
Elements in the tree can be checked, and a split button is available to apply some tools on the selected elements (e.g. hide, show, collapse).

A checkbox is available to (un) select all the elements in the tree at once.

The interface should look like

The tree and the diagram should be synchronized: an update in the diagram should update the content of the tree (in particular the icons next to each tree node item), and executing a tool from the form view should udpate the diagram accordingly.

This feature is a particular implementation of #3428 with a `FormDescription` initialized from the content of a diagram representation.

### Cuttings backs
- The split button should only support actions that have an associated event handler. In particular, accessing `DiagramServices` from the form is out of the scope of this issue.

I suggest updating MUI to version 5 as Material UI 4 is outdated and does not receive security or performance updates. Also it's a complicated task to combine different versions of MUI in a single application. We managed it in our MUI 5 application based on Sirius Web, but it is really painful.

Also it will allow one to migrate to React 18 later.

# What is changed

1) The following dependencies are updated:

```diff
-""@material-ui/core"": ""4.12.4"",
-""@material-ui/icons"": ""4.11.3"",
-""@material-ui/lab"": ""4.0.0-alpha.61"",
+""@mui/material"": ""5.15.19"",
+""@mui/icons-material"": ""5.15.19"",
+""@mui/x-tree-view"": ""7.6.1"",
```

2) Changed namespaces:

```
@material-ui/core -> @mui/material
@material-ui/icons -> @mui/icons-material
```

3) `<TreeView>` component moved to a separate project:

```diff
-import TreeView from '@material-ui/lab/TreeView';
-import { TreeItem } from '@material-ui/lab';
+import { SimpleTreeView } from '@mui/x-tree-view/SimpleTreeView';
+import { TreeItem } from '@mui/x-tree-view/TreeItem';
```

4) Changed `<Autocomplete>` component:

```diff
-import Autocomplete from '@material-ui/lab/Autocomplete';
+import Autocomplete from '@mui/material/Autocomplete';
```

It requires `getOptionKey` if labels are not unique

`renderOption` should return `<li {...props}>`

Nested `<Chip>` doesn't require `key` property, because it's already returned by `getTagProps()`

5) `<TextField>` and `<Select>` are outlined by default in MUI 5, so added the following to the theme:

```
{
  components: {
    MuiTextField: {
      defaultProps: {
        variant: 'standard',
      },
    },
    MuiSelect: {
      defaultProps: {
        variant: 'standard',
      },
    },
  },
},
```

6) `makeStyles` is replaced by TSS version

https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migrating-from-jss/

```diff
-import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
+import { makeStyles } from 'tss-react/mui';
```

Also it doesn't support functions for each individual style property. Only a single function is supported

I didn't use the following version, because it doesn't work:
```
import { makeStyles } from '@mui/styles';
```

I guess that now it's recommended to use `styled` instead of `makeStyles`. But it's your decision, so I left `makeStyles` as is with slight syntax changes.

When we migrated our own app to MUI 5 we decided to drop CSS-in-JS completely, because:

- Modern CSS is just fine, it supports everything required, and there is no need for an additional abstraction level
- You have to learn CSS-in-JS, but the amount of documentation is way lower in comparison to plain CSS
- Plain CSS is much easier to write, maintain and understand. It's impossible to use some complicated functions in CSS
- When you separate TypeScript code and CSS styles in different files it's easier to understand and maintain the app
- CSS is a standard, it's backward compatible. You don't have to rewrite all styles after each library update. Who knows, maybe authors of React and MUI are planing to change CSS-in-JS library after each major release and maybe ten years later they will back to plain CSS :)
- We use CSS-classes in Cypress-tests instead of data-testid, ARIA attributes or explicit CSS. For instance `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/diagrams/collapse.cy.ts` at check `.should('have.css', 'border-bottom', '1px solid rgb(51, 176, 195)')` is failed on my machine, because the border width is `0.8px`. So I prefer to check existence of a CSS-class instead

But it's just our private opinion on CSS-in-JS, not absolute truth

7) I had to increase specificity of some styles because they were ignored:

```diff
-select: {
-  display: 'flex',
-  alignItems: 'center',
-},
+select: {
+  '&': {
+    display: 'flex',
+    alignItems: 'center',
+  },
+},
```

For example in `packages/forms/frontend/sirius-components-widget-reference/src/modals/CreateModal.tsx`

8) `nth-child(2)` in `makeStyles` caused runtime warnings so I replaced it by a separate CSS-class in `packages/core/frontend/sirius-components-core/src/workbench/RepresentationNavigation.tsx`

9) I had to add the following line at the beginning of `packages/core/frontend/sirius-components-core/src/index.ts` to fix the error ""styled_default is not a function"":

```
import '@mui/material/styles/styled';
```

See for details https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/12423#issuecomment-2080351394

10) `<Select>` role attribute is changed from `button` to `combobox` in MUI . So I updated Cypress tests

11) `<Tooltip>` adds `aria-label` instead of `title` to a nested `<Link>`

12) Tooltips works for disabled buttons only if the later one is surrounded by span

https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tooltip/#disabled-elements

```diff
<Tooltip title=""Arrange all elements"">
+ <span>
    <IconButton
      disabled={readOnly}>
      <AccountTreeIcon />
    </IconButton>
+ </span>
</Tooltip>
```

13) `theme.spacing(1)` returns string `8px` instead of number `8`. So I had to add `parseInt()` in `packages/portals/frontend/sirius-components-portals/src/representations/PortalRepresentation.tsx`

14) `theme.palette.text.hint` is removed https://github.com/mui/material-ui-pickers/issues/1681

15) Slight MUI 5 API changes:

```diff
-<Tabs scrollButtons=""on"" />
+<Tabs scrollButtons />
```

```diff
-<MenuItem button />
+<MenuItem />
```

16) It seems that `<Popper>` doesn't support `transition` attribute. If the attribute is specified then Popper is shown in the left upper corner.

Removed `trnasition` from `packages/diagrams/frontend/sirius-components-diagrams/src/renderer/palette/tool-section/ToolSection.tsx` and `packages/diagrams/frontend/sirius-components-diagrams/src/renderer/palette/group-tool/GroupPalette.tsx`

17) Added `@emotion/react` peer dependency to `sirius-components-forms` to fix ""You are loading @emotion/react when it is already loaded. Running multiple instances may cause problems. This can happen if multiple versions are used, or if multiple builds of the same version are used.""

# Cypress tests

I've fixed most of the tests after migration. But there are still some problems. Tests work unstable on my machine. Maybe it works better in your environment. Could you please help to fix it?

Some tests are failed when Cypress is run in a headless mode, probably because of problems with a clipboard or something else.

## When run in an interactive mode the following tests are failed for Chrome:

1) `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/diagrams/collapse.cy.ts`

expected '<div.nopan>' to have CSS property 'border-bottom' with the value '1px solid rgb(51, 176, 195)', but the value was '0.8px solid rgb(51, 176, 195)'

I tried to change Zoom factor in a browser, but it doesn't help. I think the test should not rely on a particular border width.


## For Electron the following tests are failed:

1) `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/diagrams/collapse.cy.ts`

In file `integration-tests/cypress/workbench/Explorer.ts` the test is failed on `cy.getByTestId('new-object-modal').should('not.exist')`. But if I add `cy.wait(2000)` before this line, the test is passed:

```
  public createObject(objectTreeItemLabel: string, childCreationDescriptionLabel: string) {
    this.getTreeItemByLabel(objectTreeItemLabel).find('button').click();
    cy.getByTestId('new-object').click();

    cy.getByTestId('childCreationDescription').children('[role=""combobox""]').invoke('text').should('have.length.gt', 1);
    cy.getByTestId('childCreationDescription').click();
    cy.getByTestId('childCreationDescription')
      .get(`[data-value=""${childCreationDescriptionLabel}""]`)
      .should('exist')
      .click();
    cy.getByTestId('create-object').click();
    // The test is fixed if I add the following line:
    // cy.wait(2000);
    cy.getByTestId('new-object-modal').should('not.exist');
  }
```

2) `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/diagrams/group-palette.cy.ts`

Error: ""expected [data-testid=""GroupPalette""] to exist in the DOM""

3) `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/diagrams/node-aspect-ratio.cy.ts`

Error: ""Expected to find element: [data-testid=""option-Node""], but never found it.""

Thank you very much for this detailed ticket and the associated pull request!
We will take a look at it, in the next weeks.

To update the snapshots, you first have to delete them, an then execute the test script in the dedicated package.
In your case, it seems you have to execute `node run test` in `packages/core/frontend/sirius-components-core/`.

Last thing, you commit messages should look like this:

I've added `Bug` and `Signed-off-by` to commits. And fixed errors for `sirius-components-core`.

But now there are a lot off errors for `sirius-components-forms`, because format of CSS class names is changed:
```diff
<div
-  class=""makeStyles-subscribers-126""
+  class=""css-1aqjzxi-subscribers""
/>
```

(Just a side note: That's one more reason to dislike CSS-in-JS :) From my point of view these autogenerated CSS class names only add complexity and improve nothing)

New `makeStyle()` function from TSS React is based on `@emotion/react`. Here is a plugin `@emotion/jest` that should fix class names: https://emotion.sh/docs/testing But it's for jest only. There is no such a library for vitest yet: https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/3132

Defined a custom snapshot serializer in `packages/forms/frontend/sirius-components-forms/vitestSerializer.ts` that transforms CSS class names from `css-hash-suffix` to `makeStyles-suffix`

Updated vitest to latest version, because `snapshotSerializers` option was added to `vite.config.js` recently: https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/2023

Also I've fixed some Cypress tests. It seems that `.click('top')` doesn't work well in Electron. I replaced it by `.click(1, 1)` in `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/diagrams/collapse.cy.ts`. And added the following code to this test:
```
cy.on('uncaught:exception', (err) =>
  err.message.includes('ResizeObserver loop limit exceeded') ? false : undefined
);
```
For sure it would be better to find an origin of the error and fix it. But it's hard to reproduce, it seems to be a known bug and people recommend to ignore it https://stackoverflow.com/a/50387233/632199

Two Cypress tests are still unstable:

- `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/forms/widget-reference.cy.ts`
- `integration-tests/cypress/e2e/project/portals/portals.cy.ts`

The pull request: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/pull/3448

### Expected behavior

`For` operation is available in Sirius Desktop, so it will be useful in Sirius Web.

For instance, we use domain based edges (relationships described using a EClass in a metamodel). A deletion tool for objects should remove not only objects, but also should find all domain based edges related to a deleted object and remove them as well. We use an expression of the following form `aql:self.eContainer(ns::Model).relationships->select(rel | rel.source = self or rel.target = self)` to iterate over all related relationships and remove them.

### Cuttings backs

No

### Potential side effects

Operations DSL can become too complicated?

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Implement a Java-service, but it's too complicated for non-developers who creates a dynamic metamodel and representation specification.

### Questions

I've got some questions, could you please help?

1. What is a right way to generate code for changed Ecore-files? Just open a genmodel-file and use ""Generate All"" command? But it generates some extra files (build.properties, plugin.xml), also tests are failed for generated files. Maybe you use some Maven command to regenerate all?
2. How to generate builders in `sirius-components-view-builder` package?
3. Should For-operation automatically change context to current iterator value? Or ChangeContext operation should be explicit? Sirius desktop changes context automatically for For-operations and CreateInstance-operations. But Sirius Web doesn't do it for CreateInstance. Should it? I think that auto changing of a context is handy, but it's safer not to implement it now, so people will not rely on it and their specifications will not be broken in future if you decide to change that behaviour
4. I've got a build error ""more tests are required"" for projects `sirius-components-view` and `sirius-components-view-edit`. I don't what kind of tests I can add.

The pull request: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/pull/3463

### Expected behavior

One changes a domain or view. And then models and diagrams (based on the domain or view) are automatically updated without application restart. For example, I change a node style in a view, and all nodes are automatically updated on a diagram.

It's very controversial feature, but I propose it anyway. Maybe you will find it useful.

### Cuttings backs

At now only a current editing context is updated. Ideally all editing contexts dependent on changed domains or views should be updated. However maybe it's better to update a current editing context only, so it can be used for testing. It's very handy to change a view and see an updated diagram immediately.

An editing context is updated on any change of a domain or view, even on focus change. We should update the editing context only if necessary.

### Potential side effects

Performance issues, because an editing context is updated on any change of a domain or view. Maybe you can help to fix it?

Model or diagram corruption, for instance, on class renaming. But they can be corrupted anyway. This pull requests just increases a frequency of model and diagram update.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Add an explicit ""Reload"" command to models and diagrams. However it would not be so handy.

### Notes on the code

1. `EditingContextSearchService::findById()` always creates a new editing context. It's impossible to get an existing editing context used by event processors. I changed this behaviour. Added a cache of editing contexts and now  `EditingContextSearchService` creates a new one only if necessary.

2. I had to add `IEMFEditingContext::isDisposed()` method, so `EditingContextSearchService` can determine that an editing context was disposed and it should be removed from the cache.

3. Changed type of `EditingContext::views` from `List<View>` to `Map<String, View>`. It allows to update a changed view only. Not to reload all views.

In general this feature is crucial for us. But the implementation is very hacky. Maybe you could suggest some improvements? Or it should be implemented in a completely different way?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3462/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The pull request: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/pull/3465

### Expected behavior

We need to localize domain and view forms. But there are two problems:

1. Some strings are hard-coded on backend
2. Identifiers of child creation descriptions are locale-dependent. When I add localization files tests become broken

I suggest to fix it and simplify localization

### Cuttings backs

No.

### Potential side effects

No.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Add a localization on the application level, but it's a way more complicated and impossible for some strings, because they are hard-coded.

### What's changed

1. Added `EEnumLiteralLabelProvider` that gets a localized label for EEnumLiteral

3. Added i18n support for `DomainPropertiesConfigurer`, `MultipleDomainPropertiesConfigurer`, `FixedColorPropertiesConfigurer`, `PropertiesWidgetCreationService`, `NodeStylePropertiesConfigurer`, `EdgeStylePropertiesConfigurer` and some other classes

4. Changed `DefaultEditService::getChildCreationDescriptions()` and `DefaultEditService::createChild()`. They used `helper.getCreateChildText()` to get a localized child description identifiers. So these identifiers changed after I added localization and tests was broken. Now I replaced identifiers by ones of the form: `containmentFeatureName-ChildClassName`. They guaranteed to be locale-independent and unique

5. Added to `DefaultLabelService::getLabel()` usage of `IItemLabelProvider`

6. Removed `packages/view/backend/sirius-components-view-emf/src/main/resources/messages/sirius-web-emf.properties`. It overrided `packages/emf/backend/sirius-components-emf/src/main/resources/messages/sirius-web-emf.properties` during tests in GitHub and leaded to strange test fails

7. Added ru localization for several packages","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3464/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The round is done with lower value (Math.floor)

This is normal, but it means a query like `query getReferenceValueOptions()` does not find the details view representation description and (incorrectly) returns null.

The proper solution is for these representation descriptions to be registered inside the editing context when loaded (via an `IEditingContextProcessor#preProcess`) so that they can be found like any other. This also means that `PropertiesEventProcessorFactory`, `RelatedElementsEventProcessorFactory` and `RepresentationsEventProcessorFactory` could get the proper representation description directly from the editing context instead of requesting a new copy of the representation description from their special-purpose providers (e.g. `this.propertiesDefaultDescriptionProvider.getFormDescription()`).

Actually this does not seem possible, at least not without API changes. This would require the representation event processor factories to use `org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.editingcontext.EditingContext.getRepresentationDescriptions()` which is only available in `sirius-web-application`.

I guess we could have:

If someone wants to contribute to an existing extension point, it replaces the default value but
sometime we may want to add additional values instead. This should be configurable. To solve this
issue, SiriusWebApplication should have an optional prop named extensionRegistryMergeStrategy
with the following type :
```
interface ExtensionRegistryMergeStrategy { 

	mergeComponentExtensions(
		identifier: string, 
		existingValues:ComponentExtension<any>[], 
		newValues: ComponentExtension<any>[]): ComponentExtension<any>[];

	mergeDataExtensions(
		identifier: string, 
		existingValue: DataExtension<any>, 
		newValue: DataExtension<any>): DataExtension<any>;
}
```
This strategy should be given to ExtensionRegistry#addAll in order to let contributors decide how
they want to merge their own extension registries with the default one. By default,
SiriusWebApplication should provide one which would add component extensions and override
data extensions:
```
class DefaultExtensionRegistryMergeStrategy implements ExtensionRegistryMergeStrategy {
 
	public mergeComponentExtensions(identifier: string, existingValues: ComponentExtension<any>[], newValues: ComponentExtension<any>[]): ComponentExtension<any>[]

It seems there are more improvements possible but they would require changing the interface/protocol, notably getOrCreateId which, when an IdAdapter is not found, creates a new ID but does not add it to the object. This makes `JsonResource.attachedHelper()` do some duplicate work:

```java
String id = idManager.getOrCreateId(eObject);
this.setID(eObject, id);
```

with setId calling `findId` and then `setId`, and all 3 of `getOrCreateId`, `findId` and `setId` iterating at least once over all the adapters.

Another potential improvement which would require API change is that EMF JSON assumes ids can be any String, but in Sirius Web we use actual UUIDs. Calls to UUID.toString() to adapt to this mismatch is actually non trivial:

Granted, it's only 2%, but still, 81ms spent just for this when loading a medium-sized model seems too much.

1. Open a project with two diagrams, one small (S) and one big (B).
2. Open S, select a element in the explorer.
3. Expand/collapse the element in the explorer, *not changing the selection*. The effect is immediate.
4. Open B instead of S, and repeat step 3, expanding/collapsing the same element. It is now very slow.

There is no actual selection change, but since `SelectionContextProvider`'s `setSelection` does not check that it calls `setState` with a new selection objet structurally equivalent but different in terms of identity. Now that the selection context is high in the component hierarchy, this re-renders the whole workbench, including the big diagram.

The solution is the same as in d995d6e79d41926f41290f0b4661a1ae118bc2b9: update the selection state if the key is new value is really structurally different from the previous one.

It only works with already visible tree items.

I'm not sure exactly why we get duplicate keys here, but once they occur, the 2-args version of `Collectors.toMap()` we use throws an exception in the middle of the `DiagramEventProcessor.handle` execution, which is not handled and causes all kinds of issues.

I'll continue to invesitgate the root cause of the duplicates, but also propose an PR to use the 3-args version of `Collectors.toMap()` in the few places where we use the 2-args one to at least mitigate the consequences.

This can be long and is blocking (because EMF resources can not be safely used by multiple threads).

Ideally we would only save the ""delta"" of the change itself, and this might be possible but probably require a significant effort. A middle ground that seem to be worth investigating is to only save the sub-set of documents which are impacted by the change. Of course it would only be useful for _some_ projects (with data split in multiple resources) and _some_ changes (which do not recursively impact all/most of the resources).

EMF has native support for resource modification tracking (`resource.setTrackingModification(true)` on load, and then `resource.isModified()` to test the flag and `resource.setModified(false)` to reset it on save), so identifying which resources have been directly changed is trivial.

What's less trivial (but not that complicated) is that if resource _A_ has been changed and resource _B_ has not, the change in _A_ might still have an impact on _B_'s serialisation, if _B_ contains a reference to at least one object in _A_ whose URI has been modified by the change.

I'll try to prototype such an approach just to see if it's worth.

Computing the sub-set of resources that need to be saved is relatively slow (though I have some ideas to work around that), but most importantly, in the case of the ""Sirius Web"" Papaya example it does not gain much. For example, the ""EObject"" class in the ""Eclipse EMF"" resource, which should sit at the bottom of the dependencies and not be impacted by most changes contains an ""Extended By"" reference which makes it ""dirty"" as soon as any resource which defines a metamodel is touched.
So in practice because of this kind or references accross all layers, when flipping a simple boolean flag inside a class from ""Sirius Components - Papaya"" marks almost all the resources as potentially impacted and thus saved.

Currently when a tool is executed, it's handler has no way to know what semantic change it performed, or even *if* it actually performed a change. So all handlers publish a `ChangeKind.SEMANTIC_CHANGE` just to be safe. And then `EditingContextPersistenceService` *unconditionally* persists anything.

Even in normal functioning, there are cases where the user invokes a tool which does not actually perform any semantic change (for example the user request is invalid and rejected, or the tool's behavior does not actually *need* to make any change because the model is already in the expected state). In such a case we currently still persist the whole resource set.

If we enable EMF's resource modification tracking (and reset the `isModified` flag on actual save of course), `EditingContextPersistenceService` can safely bypass the whole persistence if it detects that no EMF resource is actually modified. This is very fast to test.

This would have a more limited impact than the approach outlined above, which is still relevant. But it seems like a safe ""quick win"" that can be done as a first step.

It's on the critical path of almost every operation.

Currently the first thing it does is to test:
```java
if (this.editingContextSearchService.existsById(editingContextId)) {
```
before looking into the currently loaded event processors (`this.editingContextEventProcessors.get(editingContextId)`).

The `existsById` call ends up in `SemanticDataSearchService.existsByProject`, which will search into the database:

This means we hit the DB at least once for every input. In the nominal case, we will only receive requests for already loaded editing context. Once a project is loaded, it will probably receive thousands of inputs before becoming inactive and being disposed.

On my machine where PostgreSQL is running locally, just this test costs about 7ms. It's probably more when the DB is on a remote host (though I have not measured).

Technically, changing the order of the test (look for an already loaded editing context in the fast patch) could change the semantics if the project has just been removed from the database and its editing context event processor not yet disposed/removed, thought I'm not even sure this can happen.

When *deleting* a project, `MutationDeleteProjectDataFetcher` invokes directly `IProjectApplicationService.deleteProject`, which ends up removing the data from the DB (via `ProjectDeletionService.deleteProject(UUID)`), but this is in the application layer.

Even though we publish a `ProjectDeletedEvent`, the code in e.g. `EditingContextEventProcessorRegistry` (or anything in Sirius Components) has no way to react to this, so it currently *must* ask the database for the current state (otherwise this leads to symptoms like #3829).

Note that the problem is more general than ""just"" `EditingContextEventProcessorRegistry#getOrCreateEditingContextEventProcessor`. **Every** GraphQL operation inside `Viewer#editingContext` passes through `ViewerEditingContextDataFetcher` which starts by testing if `this.editingContextApplicationService.existsById(editingContextId)`, and for the same reason the only way for it to get an up to date answer is to ask the DB.

This means that most interactions that seem inoccuous like clicking on an element in a diagram to get it's palette require (at least) one round trip to the database.

> When _deleting_ a project, `MutationDeleteProjectDataFetcher` invokes directly `IProjectApplicationService.deleteProject`, which ends up removing the data from the DB (via `ProjectDeletionService.deleteProject(UUID)`), but this is in the application layer.

For this part of the problem, it might actually just be enough to add:
```java
this.editingContextEventProcessorRegistry.disposeEditingContextEventProcessor(input.projectId().toString());
```
in `MutationDeleteProjectDataFetcher` [as it existed before](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/87a8616792bbf8aa3500dae1143938c798dd80f6/packages/sirius-web/backend/sirius-web-graphql/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/graphql/datafetchers/mutation/MutationDeleteProjectDataFetcher.java).

1. Open a diagram with several nodes.
2. Close all views (Explorer, Details) except the diagram.
3. Select a node.

Tested on: v2024.5.1-19-g62d42d0df.

The frontend sends two GraphQL queries to the backend (`getPalette` and `getToolSections`) which both take a significant amount of time (here on a medium/large diagram), resp. 51 and 54ms:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/10608/9a096958-add8-4226-a7bc-261b7dd21b5e)

Looking at what's happening on the backend, most of this time is spent in `EditingContextRepresentationDataFetcher` calling `this.representationMetadataSearchService.findByRepresentationId(representationId)`:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/assets/10608/be636192-100a-4e49-916c-a4ecee835285)

`RepresentationMetadataSearchService.findByRepresentationId(representationId)` does:

```java
    @Override
    public Optional<RepresentationMetadata> findByRepresentationId(String representationId) {
        return this.representationMetadataProviders.stream()
                .filter(provider -> provider.canHandle(representationId))
                .map(provider -> provider.handle(representationId))
                .findFirst();
    }
```

First, the `IRepresentationMetadataProvider` API forces us to perform two separate calls (`canHandle` and `handle`), both of which will query the database in the case of persistent representations. This could probably be improved with a single `Optional<RepresentationMetadata> handle(String representationId)`.

Second, `PersistentRepresentationMetadataProvider.handle` will load the whole representation data, including the (potentially very large) `content`, which is not acutally used to build the `RepresentationMetadata` returned.

This could be avoided with a custom query `Optional<RepresentationData> IRepresentationDataRepository#findMetadataById(UUID id)` which returns an empty `content` and avoids loading that from the DB.

1. Open a representation from the _Explorer_. It becomes selected.
2. Close it. It stays selected.
3. Click on it in the _Explorer_ to re-open: it does not open (probably because we now filter the event as a ""non-event"", as it does not actually change the selection).

It's just more impacting in terms of performance for diagrams which can quickly become large compared to the other kinds of representations (only large explorer trees with thousands of tree items could also be a problem I think for now).

The issue is that on any semantic change (in practice, any execution of a tool which *may* have a semantic impact, whether it actually *did* change something, see [this comment in another context](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3637#issuecomment-2194201390)) we must refresh/update all the active representations (e.g. diagrams) in the same editing context. Such is the open-ended nature of Sirius that we can not reliably predict, for a given tool execution or semantic change, which representations it will actually impact or not, so we must update all.

However, once the backend has done its work, i.e. `DiagramCreationService.refresh(IEditingContext, IDiagramContext)` has obtained the updated version of the `Diagram`, we unconditionally send the whole ""new version"" to all client browsers who currently display that diagram. For large diagrams this can have significant performance impact. It means we serialize the `Diagram` DTO as a GraphQL payload (with a non-trivial overhead in invoking all the field resolvers), potentially once per browser/client, and then send large amount of data (a medium-sized diagram can represent several megabytes of payload) to the clients, which *then* have to re-render it.

This whole process is required in the case where the new/updated version of the diagram is actually different from the previous one, but is 100% overhead when the diagram was not _actually_ impacted by the semantic change which triggered the refresh, and the newly computed diagram is identical to the previous one.

This not an uncommon case at all. It two users Alice and Bob are working on the same project, each in separate subsets of the project and with their own diagrams opened, any change by Alice in the semantic subset she is working on will trigger a refresh of both Alice & Bob's diagrams (which is normal), but also, in this case, re-sending the same diagram he currently has displayed to Bob for no reason.

* Comparing `previousDiagram` and `diagram` in `DiagramCreationService.refresh` to detect if there was any actual change may not be free in terms of performance. This will need to be measured to see if the actual check will not be counter-productive.
* The current API of `DiagramCreationService.refresh()` would need to evolve to be able to return ""nothing changed"". It already returns an `Optional<Diagram`>, so there may be nothing to change in terms of Java types, but *the way this Optional is interpreted* by  `DiagramEventProcessor.refresh(ChangeDescription)` is that if the returned Optional is empty, it means the diagram could not be rendered, not that it was rendered and produced the same result as before.
* The ""end game"" for this whole subject would be to compute precise deltas of ""what changed"" between the two versions of a diagram and only send that. But that is much more complex and impacting and the first step of just computing a ""did it change?"" flag should already get us some benefit with limited risks.

Opening this context menu always _selects_ the item, which in turn will open the representation we want to delete. For large representations this can take a while and is counterproductive and frustrating as we want to _delete_ it.

Note that it's also true for renaming, which is something that technically we might want to do without opening the representation.

I guess an option (*if* we want to ""fix"" this) would be to allow for opening the context menu of items without selecting them (e.g. using a right click), but that may have other implications (the target tree item of the menu not being the currently selected item).

Another one, but that would change the workflow a lot, would be to decouple ""select"" (single click) from ""open"" (e.g. double click), in the same as e.g. in the Eclipse Explorer (where I don't have to *open* a (possible large) file just to delete/rename or otherwise operate on it.

[^1]: Technically there's another one, by selecting the target semantic element and using the ""Representations"" panel/view, which has a directly accessible ""Delete"" icon, but it's much less obvious/natural and probably much less known by users. ~~And [it seems broken in the new architecture at the moment](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3672)~~.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3673/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When an end-user clicks on a reference widget, the candidates (i.e. reference options) are computed and the displayed.

In some cases, it could be great to have the possibility to still returns the candidates corresponding to the type of the reference even if the owner does not contains the reference.

Here on the bottom of the screenshot is the rendered label used to calculate the size of the node after a resize.

I think that it would be easier and more intuitive for the user to restrict the resize of a node. For example if a node have a children with a fixed label size, the user should not be able to resize the node with a dimension smaller than the fixed children label.

What do you think ? @sbegaudeau @frouene

- are defined on the same semantic element
- with the same definition
- with the same label

And the end user cannot either. See ADR 108 for more details.

The only way we could really distinguish them would be by asking the specifier for an identifier for each widget instance (some sort of identifierExpression). It's the same in diagrams where you cannot have two nodes with the same:

- node description
- semantic element
- parent node
- containment kind (they are both a child or border node of their parent)

We can't distinguish them otherwise. Sirius desktop and web have never asked the specifier to provide such identification. It would be helpful for some tricky use cases but cumbersome for most use cases. It's also the same issue with multiple edges of the same kind between two nodes.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc6Dwn--/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to reproduce

Try to upload this project:
[Batmobile-Imported.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16194704/Batmobile-Imported.zip)

May be the project contains bad cross references but I don't think it should be a reason for `RewriteProxiesEventHandler#rewriteProxyURIs` to fail.

In the UML metamodel, we can find the following annotation:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1ef0d0a-2280-4e1e-8303-6a7fa42a315e)

My understanding is that the feature `ownedGroup` needs to be serialized as `group`. (Note there is also a `group` EReference but this one is Derived/Transient/Volatile).

```xml
<packagedElement xmi:type=""uml:Activity"" xmi:id=""_B6tXUEj9Ee-Rp58iMjoc3A"" name=""Activity1"" node=""_Ddv3YEj9Ee-Rp58iMjoc3A"">
    <node xmi:type=""uml:InitialNode"" xmi:id=""_Ddv3YEj9Ee-Rp58iMjoc3A"" name=""InitialNode1""/>
</packagedElement>

But when this feature is read, it should fill the `ownedGroup` feature.

Previously in _Papyrus Web_, we removed the BasicExtendedMetadata object from the _ResourceSet_ by customizing the _EditingContextSearchService_ and the _EditingContextFactory_. In the new architecture, we replaced this behavior by doing the same in a custom _IEditingContextProcessor_.

However, this is not enough because it is now forced by the following services to plug the MigrationParticipant (since it inherits from BasicExtendedMetadata) behavior:

*  _org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.document.services.JSONExternalResourceLoaderService.getResource(InputStream, URI, ResourceSet)_
* _org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.editingcontext.services.ResourceToDocumentService.toDocument(Resource)_
* _org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.editingcontext.services.ResourceLoader.toResource(ResourceSet, String, String, String)_
* _org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.document.services.DocumentSanitizedJsonContentProvider.getContent(ResourceSet, String, InputStream)_

EMFJson expects to load a flat ID list as it has encountered a non-containment EReference (`group`) but gets some structured data since it is, in fact, the content of the `ownedGroup` feature.

This problem arises because the _forced_ implementation in the _MigrationService_ does not delegate the computation that retrieves the feature from a name to its superclass implementation:

```java
@Override
public EStructuralFeature getElement(EClass eClass, String namespace, String eStructuralFeatureName) {
    EStructuralFeature structuralFeature = eClass.getEStructuralFeature(eStructuralFeatureName);
    for (IMigrationParticipant migrationParticipant : this.migrationParticipantsCandidates) {
        EStructuralFeature newStructuralFeature = migrationParticipant.getEStructuralFeature(eClass, eStructuralFeatureName);
        if (newStructuralFeature != null) {
            structuralFeature = newStructuralFeature;
        }
    }
    return structuralFeature;
}
```

Moreover, to make it work, we would need to be able to provide our own implementation of _BasicExtendedMetaData_ to override the following method _org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.BasicExtendedMetaData.isFeatureNamespaceMatchingLax()_ so it can return true.

Maybe a solution would be for the two given services not to directly override the _JsonResource.OPTION_EXTENDED_META_DATA_ option but:

* First, check the ResourceSet if this option is set.
* If it is not, create a _BasicExtendedMetaData_.
* Then compose either the retrieved _ExtendedMetaData_ or the newly created one into the _MigrationService_.

Then modify the MigrationService so it delegates most of its behavior to the given _ExtendedMetaData_.

That being said, the migration service's main use case for the time being (for semantic data) is for *us* (the Sirius Web project) to support transparent backward compatibility for instances of the _View_ and _Domain_ models. It would make sense to make the whole mechanism ""opt in"", explicitly ask for it on our side for these two kinds of semantic resources, and leave the EMF defaults as before for resources/documents where migration support is not explicitly asked for.

  * a configurable `threshold` (in number of documents) above which parallel loading/saving is enabled. The default could be `-1` or `0` to disable the feature, and setting it to e.g. `5` would mean ""only try to parallelize loading/saving of the project contains at least 5 resources/.documents""

### Expected behavior
In the current implementation of SysOn, I have found that the connection routing cannot be done properly. The moving of lines as well as the edge connection points of the lines and line jumps cannot be edited. I was told that a Sirus web implementation is required for this customisation. I see it as a key feature for use as a graphical editor.

### Steps to reproduce

A user of SysON seems to have problem with special characters after the a restart of the server.
See https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/650.
I didn't succeed in reproducing his problem.
What could cause that in Sirius Web?

Special characters are correctly saved/reloaded.

### Actual behavior

Special characters are badly saved/reloaded.

Although it's not the common case, it's possible for a handler to return this `ChangeKind` even though the tool invoked did not actually perform any change in the semantic data (indeed, most tools' behavior is opaque to the handler which invoke them, so the handlers always assume the ""worst"" and suppose the tool *did* make some changes).

EMF has native support for resource modification tracking (`resource.setTrackingModification(true)` on load, and then `resource.isModified()` to test the flag, which is automatically reset on save), so identifying *if* any of the project's resources has actually been modified is trivial.

This is a simpler and safer subset of https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3637.

I'll add them all here, feel free to open separate issues for the ones the are actually relevant (and nor a misunderstanding on my part):

When expanding an Entity definition, I see a new 'superTypes' child, but it has no proper icon:

![Capture d’écran du 2024-08-29 16-19-47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd1b9097-8bcf-4e7d-9e2c-590322a4e6fd)

When I select the new node, I don't get anything in the Details view except ""No object selected"".

When the virtual node is visible multiple times, selecting one shows all the corresponding tree items as selected, it's confusing:

![Capture d’écran du 2024-08-29 16-27-53](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59f91695-ba91-4714-88d7-974e4f57826b)

This is probably more specific to the way the new capability is used in the ExplorerDescriptionProvider, but now the same elements can appear multiple times in the explorer, and they have the same issue when one ""instance"" is selected:

![Capture d’écran du 2024-08-29 16-26-08](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f81b2c1-9dae-492d-95c7-62f49bc524b4)

I have not checked (yet), but I suspect that if I create a reference loop with A extends B extends A (semantically invalid, but technically possible) and then try to ""Expand All"" on A, then I would trigger some kind of infinite loop.

I would try to contribute a fix for this composed of two features:

First add an ""ancestorIds"" in the variable manager that keeps tracks of all parent ids of the current rendering TreeItem. This variable could be used to generate truly unique id for TreeItem. That would give the opportunity for the specifier to create such loop.

Add a security in Sirius Web that prevents the creating of a child if its id is contained in the ""ancestorId"" list. To make the user aware of the problem I would suggest to return a ""Virtual"" Tree item that show the possible infinite loop.

This item will have the same icon than the TreeItem causing the problem plus a warning sign. A prefix will be added to the label to identify the problem.

1. Create a Flow project with a ""Topography unsynchronized"" diagram.
2. Open it on two different browser windows (not strictly necessary, but it's a case that should work too).
3. In both windows, select the _CompositeProcessor1_ element. The diagram does not currently show this element (it's empty), so there's nothing to select there.
4. In one of the windows, drop _CompositeProcessor1_ on the diagram. A corresponding node appears on both windows, the _CompositeProcessor1_ is still selected in the Explorer and Details view, but the corresponding diagram element is *not* selected.

This breaks the invariant (never explicited but which seems natural) that ""the elements which appear selected on a diagram correspond exactly to the graohical representations of the semantic elements selected in the workbench"".

This occurs because we automatically expands elements in the tree structure to ensure the selected element is visible. However, this behavior can be undesirable when the parent element is not selectable, as it causes the parent to re-expand unnecessarily.

### Expected behavior

The parent element should remain collapsed, even if a child element is selected.

### Actual behavior

### Expected behavior
When a node is selected on a diagram, and the user hits `ctrl + v` (or `meta + v`), the direct edit of the element should trigger (if any), and the initial content of the direct edit field should contain the content of the clipboard.

### Cuttings backs
This issue focuses on diagrams, and doesn't address direct edit in other representations.

### Potential side effects
This feature may create a conflict with a future implementation of copy/paste in Sirius Web.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

- [ ] We recently add new responsibilities to the editing context, we should extract them into something else.
	- `inputId2change`, `representationChangesDescription` and, `changeRecorder` should be put into something like `EditingContextUndoRedoManager` which, with the `EditingContext` should be put in something like `IEditingContextEventProcessorState`
	- All `IEditingContextEventHandler`s should use that state instead of just the editing context
	- With this, it could be possible to move _Undo[Representation]EventHandlers_ and _Redo[Representation]EventHandlers_ in their respective collaborative modules
- [ ] We should create a `IRepresentationContext` which all kind of representation should implement for their `IRepresentationEventProcessor`
	- This would permit to extract the record of changes made in `DiagramEventProcessor` and `PortalEventProcessor` in their own services, between the refresh and the post refresh of a representation
- [ ] Bug: All event sending a `LayoutDiagramInput` are reverted with only one undo.
      This happens because all layout inputs coming from the frontend are identified using the ID of the last refresh with cause ""refresh""
- [ ] Implement undo/redo for `IDiagramEvent`
	- `DiagramEventProcessor`: to update in order to record changes of all following events (same as the Hide event)
	- `UndoDiagramEnventHandler`: undo of all following events
	- `RedoDiagramEventHandler`: redo of all following events
	- `ReconnectEdgeEvent`
	- `UpdateCollapsingStateEvent`
	- `HideDiagramElementEvent` (only `canUndo` and `canRedo`)
	- `RemoveEdgeEvent`
	- `FadeDiagramElementEvent`
	- `ResetViewModifiersEvent`
	- `PinDiagramElementEvent`
- [ ] `UndoEventHandler`, `RedoEventHandler`, `UndoPortalEventHandler`, `RedoPortalEventHandler`, `UndoDiagramEventHandler` and `RedoDiagramEventHandler` : We have nothing to check if a semantic change recorded with an EMF `ChangeRecorder` can be reverted or not and once apply if it has applied successfully.
- [ ] `UndoPortalEventHandler`, `RedoPortalEventHandler`, `UndoDiagramEventHandler` and `RedoDiagramEventHandler` : Once we have undone or redone the semantic change, we have nothing ""secure"" to revert it if something happens applying the graphical change.
	- For now, we are applying the semantic change again, we should rely on something more ""transactional"", or apply graphical change first and then, apply semantic change
- [ ] Improvement : Add more feedback using message for user with undo and redo:
	- Something exists in stash for backend
	- Needs frontend change to display error when undo or redo has failed (in `UndoRedo.tsx`, in both `useEffect` concerning _undoData_ and _redoData_)
- [ ] We need to rethink if undo and redo stacks (in frontend) need to be cleared when an undo or a redo fails with error, because sometime, such action may not be done at the moment they are executed, but maybe later.
- [ ] In `UndoPortalEventHandler`, `RedoPortalEventHandler`, `UndoDiagramEventHandler` and `RedoDiagramEventHandler` all representation changes are handled in the same class, dispatch the handling in different classes.
- [ ] `UndoPortalEventHandler`, `RedoPortalEventHandler`, `UndoDiagramEventHandler` and `RedoDiagramEventHandler`: Improve how _ChangeKind_ for returned payload is computed, with a priority system for example.
- [ ] `UndoDiagramEventHandler#canUndoLayout`: We are considering that undoing a graphical node removal can always be possible while we need at least to check if the parent of a node is still existing
	-  /!\ The parent could not exist because it is part of the same removal but, we should ensure change record are made in the right order to undo and redo them in the right order.
- [ ] `UndoDiagramEventHandler#canUndoLayout`: We are considering that undoing a graphical edge removal can always be made while we need to check if the edge source and target are present.
	- /!\ Source and target could not exist because they are part of the same removal but, we should ensure change record are made in the right order to undo and redo them in the right order.
- [ ] `RedoDiagramEventHandler#canRedoLayout`: We are considering that redoing a graphical node add can always be possible while we need at least to check if the parent of a node is still existing
	- /!\ The parent could not exist because it is part of the same add but, we should ensure change record are made in the right order to undo and redo them in the right order.
- [ ] `RedoDiagramEventHandler#canRedoLayout`: We are considering that redoing a graphical edge add can always be possible while we need to check if the edge source and target are present.
	- /!\ Source and target could not exist because they are part of the same add but, we should ensure change record are made in the right order to undo and redo them in the right order.
- [ ] There is a bug with the undo of an action that remove a semantic element holding a representation that is present in a portal
	- It seems not related to the undo/redo but present since the beginning, since we did not have to handle a representation removed because of semantic removal
- [ ] Improvement : In `UndoDiagramEventHandler` and `RedoDiagramEventHandler`, are applying the whole previous layout. Instead, we should try to rely only on `DiagramLayoutChanges` when applying a `LayoutDiagramRepresentationChange` to then remove `previousLayout` and `newLayout` from `LayoutDiagramRepresentationChange`.
- [ ] Unless closing the project, and thus, disposing the editing context, there is nothing that clears out changes in the editing context.
- [ ] Improve the `ApolloLinkUndoRedoStack`: Since an `ApolloLink` propose thanks to its constructor to override the default behaviour of the `request` method we may remove our custom class to provide only the `request` method.
	- [ ] At the time the `ApolloLinkUndoRedoStack` has be written, it was relying on a regression which as been fixed.
	Since it has been fixed, `layoutDiagram` may not need to be filtered by the `request`, and thus, user actions that add an action in the `undoStack` manually could be removed.
	- The actual behaviour prevent `layoutDiagram` operation to be registered in the undo stack to prevent the `layoutDiagram` operation executing right after a ""cause refresh"" to create an entry in the undoStack.
	Making each user action to specifically add the `layoutDiagram` operation in the undoStack (e.g. `useLayoutOnBoundsChange#addUndoForLayout`)
- [ ] Improve the sessionStorage for undo and redo stack when undoing or redoing an operation returns an error.
	- Now, we are clearing both stacks, but instead, we could return an error telling that it cannot be done now, but maybe later (another user could perform an action that could make the undo/redo working)
	- in `UndoRedo.tsx` in both `useEffect` concerning _undoData_ and _redoData_.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc6Y7Pc5/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

```
this.getDomain().getResourceSet().getResources().forEach(Resource::unload);
```

This is costly both in CPU and RAM for no benefit: it will iterate on the content of all resources, compute the proxy URI for every element (which can allocate a lot of long strings and use lots of memory), and then... nothing. Nothing/nobody will ever use the ResourceSet in question after that.
Unloading is only useful to force all elements to become proxies so they are properly re-resolved afterwards, but in our case its all for nothing.

On my machine, this explicit unload takes about 820ms, compared to the ~2200ms needed to load the resource set.
It's not blocking anyone as this is only done once nobody is connected to the editing context, but it's still burning CPU and increasing memory pressure for no benefit.

I was able to reproduce this bug with an instance of a custom studio containing two node description.
I was able to move a node right after its creation if it was based on one of the node descriptions.

A created node should always be moved after its creation.

For the node that cannot be moved after its creation this error is raised in devtools
`Uncaught (in promise) ApolloError: Variable 'input' has an invalid value: Field 'x' has coerced Null value for NonNull type 'Float!'`

1. Open a project with a significant amount of element (e.g. ""Papaya Example"").
2. Expand parts of the Explorer so that at least a few hundreds (or more) items are visible
3. Resize the ""Details"" view on the right

Even though changing the width of the ""Details"" view has no impact on the size or content of the ""Explorer"" view, the Explorer is re-rendered anyway, and in such a case where many elements are visible this can currently be very slow (here for absolutely no good reason).

Actually I think the whole workbench is re-rendered in such a case: both panels and the main representation area. I have not tested but I suppose even with nothing expanded in the Explorer but a large diagram visible, we re-render the diagram and get some slowness here too (this is at least partially understandable as the diagram is adjacent to the resized panel so the resize changes the diagram's viewport size, but in the case of a diagram (as opposed to a form) we can maybe avoid an actual re-render in this case?).

Thank you for implementing this feature in 2024.11.0! It’s an important enhancement for working with the graphical editor in larger models. I appreciate the progress made here, and I have a few suggestions to improve user-friendliness:

### Expected behavior

**1) Line Movement Over Center Points**
Enable moving the entire line over center points without automatically creating a new node.

**2) Node Creation Confirmation**
Require additional confirmation (such as a double-click or new edge tool) to create new nodes. 

**3) Line Type Selection Tool**
Having an edge tool to choose line connection type.

**4) Line Jump Option**
Add an option to control line jumps. This would involve setting a priority level for each line, so that line jumps are displayed based on line hierarchy.

### Expected behavior

It's now possible to add new trees in the Explorer view.
But the default tree is still there, which is convenient for most users.
And with the default tree comes a default d&d behavior, but this behavior may not be suitable depending on the models manipulated.
Sirius Web could propose a way for specifiers/developers to override/implement their own d&d behavior for the default tree in the Explorer view.

Undo on Details View widget only revert the value display in the widget
le Undo sur la vue Details ne fonctionne pas bien. Si j'édite le nom d'un élément, puis je sélectionne une autre propriété, alors le Ctrl+Z me remet le focus sur le textfield du nom de l'élément, revient à son ancienne valeur mais sans l'appliquer, car le focus est toujours sur le textfield. Il faut à nouveau sélectionner une autre propriété pour voir le Undo vraiment effectif.

### Steps to reproduce

1. create a Flow Robot project
2. edit the name of any Robot model element in the Details view, through the associated textfield widget (Widget1)
3. change focus to any other widget (Widget2), the new value entered in Widget1 is applied
4. you can see the new value in the Details view but also in the Explorer view and in the opened Diagram
5. Undo (Ctrl+z)
6. The focus is back to Widget1, and the previous value of Widget1 is displayed in Widget1, but the previous value is not visible the Explorer view and in the opened Diagram
7. You have to focus another widget to really apply the undo

### Expected behavior

The undo action undo the changed value everywhere

### Actual behavior

The undo action only change the value inside the textfield widget, without really apply the undo

### Screenshots

No

### Steps to reproduce

Implement a code that may throw an exception during representation refresh. If an exception is thrown than a model editor stops working.

There was such a fix: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/972

It handles exceptions only for current representation refresh. But the exception can be thrown during refresh of related representations as well. So it probably should be handled similary.

### Expected behavior

Error is logged and a model editor keeps working.

### Actual behavior

The model editor stops working after exception.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4204/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The problem is that `<DiagramPanel>` calls `useArrangeAll()` that calls `useViewport()`. When you drag a diagram, a viewport is changed, so `useViewport()` hook is updated, so `useArrangeAll()` is updated and so `<DiagramPanel>` is re-rendered. It can be re-rendered hundreds times during drag

* has non-obvious semantics which make it confusing to end-users (even when disabled, _some kind_ of selection synchronization still happens, just only on the currently visible items);
* has historically been the cause of several (sometimes subtle) bugs and regressions;
* has a non-obvious UI (to me at least), with a plain (non-toggle) button being ""normal"" when the mode is active, but appearing as _disabled_ when inactive, which looks like an action that can not be performed;
* has performance impacts when enabled: for (almost?) all selection changes, at least one query to the backend to know the path of all the selected elements, and possibly one computation of a new tree subscription with a configuration set to expand all the required nodes.

Proposal:
* keep the ""if an element selected e.g. in a diagram is currently visible in the explorer, mark the corresponding item as selected"" behavior (what we have when the ""Synchronize"" mode is disabled);
* replace the ""mode"" with a single-shot action button modeled after the ""Select opened file"" action in IntelliJ: when the action is invoked, ensure all the selected elements are _visible_ in the Explorer (this may require expanding sub-trees) and then mark them selected as above.

1. Create a studio and a View
2. Create a FormDescription inside the View
3. Create and open a FormDescriptionEditor on the FormDescription (which initially contains a PageDescription).
4. From the Explorer, delete the PageDescription

The frontend crashes (blank page). Reloading from the same URL (of the FDE) does not fix anything.
Going back to the project page (not the FDE representation), as soon as you click on the broken FDE to try and delete it, it crashes again.

The only fixes are:
1. Select the FormDescription itself, and delete the FDE from the ""Representations"" view in the right panel.
2. Add a new PageDescription inside the FormDescription so that it can be opened again.

Granted, a FormDescription without a page is invalid, but the ""hard crash"" on a blank page is a bit much.

Currently there is no validation for that attribute, meaning specifiers may end up with invalid names, e.g. if a domain is named ""My Domain"", because the space character is not supported (or should be encoded).

### Expected behavior

In a `NodeTool`, a `SelectionDialogDescription` and its `SelectionDialogTreeDescription` can be used to make a diagram tool rely on a selection made by the user in a dialog.
In the expression `IsSelectableExpression`, the `self` variable gets assigned to the candidate element of the tree (e.g. so that in the tree users may only select some of the elements.).
But there is no variable for the specifier to reference the diagram or semantic element on which the tool was originally called. For instance if the goal of the tool is to change the container of some elements, we might want our selection dialog to now allow the selection of elements that are already contained by the contextual element.

### Expected behavior

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a Studio with a View tree description
2. Fill all required attributes & expressions
3. Create a Blank Project
4. Create a model instance of the domain you've created in your Studio
5. Create a tree instance on your model element

### Expected behavior

The representation should be created, opened and visible in the Explorer view and the central Representation area.

### Actual behavior

Nothing happens.

A first bug is in `ViewTreeDescriptionConverter#convert`, the `idProvider` should be `new GetOrCreateRandomIdProvider()` instead of  `variableManager -> this.getTreeId(variableManager, descriptionId)`.
But it's not the only bug, it needs more investigation to fix that.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4249/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Expected behavior

The default explorer representation is hardcoded in Sirius Web at the _description_ level.
The explorer now supports multiple tree representations, which are provided as `TreeDescriptions`, potentially defined at the _view_ level.
Services used by the default explorer take `VariableManager` as parameter, which make them practically unusable from trees defined at the _view_ level.

Extracting these services would let custom explorers reuse default explorer behavior easily.
A new API could be created to expose these services:
```java
public interface IExplorerServices {
    boolean hasChildren(Object self, IEditingContext editingContext);
    List<Object> getChildren(Object self, IEditingContext editingContext, List<String> expandedIds, List<String> activeFilterIds);
   // Other services used by the explorer
}
```

Existing default explorer services would rely on this API to compute their actual result.

### Cuttings backs

Nothing identified.

### Potential side effects

The `IExplorerTreeItemAlteredContentProvider` interface (which applies filters on the explorer) requires a `VariableManager` as parameter.
Since this interface may be implemented by downstream applications, its signature won't be updated and the associated filtering behavior will stay in the existing services.
This implies that custom explorer implementations will have to handle filters explicitly.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Migrating the default explorer as a _view_ (instead of a _description_) would be another way to tackle the issue, but it is more complicated. The proposed solution is a first step in this direction.

It's not just more complicated, it would be at least a net regression in terms of performance for not much gain.

You also have to keep in mind that we need to make OUR explorer evolve over time so the behavior and signature of those methods will change potentially significantly. Are you sure that you want to ""copy our behavior"" and not have your own behavior (even if it starts with a copy of our own)?

I just want to be sure that you want to mimic OUR explorer on the long run because if you go this way, we WILL one day change how we do things, you WILL be impacted and we may not change back our new behavior.

1. I want to create a new custom explorer that extends the existing one with, let's say, a new directory containing things I'll manage.
2. To get started, I'd like to first replicate the existing explorer. This is not trivial to do right now **if I have defined my tree at the view level** (I don't have any built-in services to call to perform the same actions as in the explorer)
3. I create my custom explorer services, reusing the default ones when needed
4. If a default service doesn't work as expected for me, I create my own

I understand your point about the future evolutions of the explorer. In this context, it makes sense to start with a copy of Sirius Web's behavior, but it would be easier to copy the `ExplorerServices` file I propose, instead of copying and adapting the description-level functions that are already implemented to make them work with my view-level tree.

All this reasoning is based on the fact that I'd like to define my custom explorer at the view level, but it is maybe not the way to go about it (especially given your point on performances).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBwOEkc6Ve_hp/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Contrary to `EditingContext#representation`. In a way, it was bound to happen since internally in Sirius Web, the only transient representations we have share a special status (explorer, details, related elements, validation, representations, etc). They do not appear in the onboard area and cannot be opened in the main tabs so they are ignored by some data fetchers to only consider persisted ones.

We should instead support any representations and instead provide dedicated data fetchers for the onboard area of Sirius Web to ask specifically for persisted representations with a field dedicated to the onboard area like:

```
type EditingContext {
  onboardArea: OnboardArea!;
}

type OnboardArea {
 representations(representationIds: [ID!]) // only return specific representations
}
```

One could for example want to only consider some specific representations for the onboard area which may include transient ones.

This ticket originally comes from SysON project (https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/874)

On ""Upload a project"" window, nothing is displayed to inform the user about specific file format to use (like described into the help https://doc.mbse-syson.org/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/hands-on/how-tos/project-management.html#upload-project ).

So often people loads a sysml file (only textual syntax) and SysON/Sirius Web stays stuck without any error message and the ""upload"" button stays gray out !

Request:
- Add a sentence about file format accepted on the ""Upload a project"" page.
- On upload action, if the file format or content is not good then warn the user about it with an explicit sentence.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a programmatic org.eclipse.sirius.components.trees.description.TreeDescription (not view TreeDescription)
2. Create an `org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.trees.api.ITreeItemContextMenuEntryProvider` that applies on a tree item of your TreeDescription
3. Create an instance of a Tree based on your TreeDescription

### Expected behavior

The `ITreeItemContextMenuEntryProvider.canHandle()` should be called each time you click on the menu entry in your tree representation

### Actual behavior

The `ITreeItemContextMenuEntryProvider.canHandle()` is never called when you click on the menu entry in your tree representation

In the `TreeEventProcessor#handle`, you can notice that a `TreeItemContextMenuInput` is never called but it should be.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4270/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to reproduce

With SysON, just enable or disable the ""Show inherited members form standard libraries"" filter on a `Part` with an `Attribute`
(could also be reproducible with Sirius Web with the appropriate list items).

### Expected behavior

The space/gap between the list items should be the same.

### Actual behavior

The space/gap between the list items are not the same.

The only difference:

* M2's conditional style sets its background color to `red 500`

Given an opened diagram, initially with a Composite Processor represented using the default style for both nodes, I edit the processor's name to 'X'

* M1 is immediately updated to apply the conditional style.

Closing the diagram and re-opening it takes M2's conditional style into account.

Editing the processor's name again so that the condition is false correctly re-applies the default style to both.

### Expected behavior

The `ExplorerDropTreeItemHandler` should only work on the default explorer provided by Sirius Web, but it is triggered on any custom explorer implementation.
This prevents downstream applications with a custom explorer from providing a custom `IDropTreeItemHandler` tailored to their domain.

### Cuttings backs


### Potential side effects

Implementing this will de-activate the default DnD implementation on custom explorers.
Downstream applications will need to provide their own implementation of `IDropTreeItemHandler`, potentially by subclassing `ExplorerDropTreeItemHandler` and changing the `canHandle` method.
The changelog should reflect this new behavior.

Here I only log when `edgeCenterX === 0 || edgeCenterY === 0` :
```js
    if (edgeCenterX === 0 || edgeCenterY === 0) {
      console.log('MultiLabelEditableEdge', { edgeCenterX, edgeCenterY, state });

```

* With the default (no manual bendpoint): we get a temporary state with `edgeCenterX === 0`
* With *one* manual bendpoint, this disappears
* With *two* manual bendpoints, the broken intermediate state is back when finishing a move.

1. Open a project. Initially there is no element selected, and the _Details_ view correctly says so: ""No object selected"".
2. Select an element in the _Explorer_ view.
3. Its details are shown in the _Details_ view, and the onboard area is updated too depending on the selected element's type.
4. Deselect the element in the _Explorer_ (Ctrl-click).
5. Now the workbench selection is empty as it was in step 1. The onboard area is updated, but the _Details_ view continues to show the details of the previously selected element. It should be back to the ""No object selected"" state.

### Expected behavior

When the user launch right click, the browser menu should not be always displayed. It will be useful to display the Sirius Web contextual menu.
For example, from the tree explorer view, it will be useful if the user can right-click on an element to display the Sirius Web contextual menu without needing to find the small dots button.

I may be able to give a look into this.
But before I do, do you have any suggestion, recommendation or requirement on both code and UX aspects?

Also when googling about custom right-click context menu a lot of concerns arise on forums about how it can badly impact user experience.  
Replacing the default browser behaviour can be something some user would definitely **not** want as it can interfere with their expectations and thus feel counter-intuitive or unnatural. Some suggests as a compromise to display the default menu, for example,  on a second right-click.

So what is your take about this? Do you want to let the user be able to also display the default menu? if yes how in terms of UI?

Thank your for your interest in this issue and the information provided.

Many users want this new behavior and after many discussions with the team, we agreed that it is best to display the context menu with the right-click instead of the left-click.

We will add an entry in the changelog to document and warn about that change.

### Expected behavior
Specifiers should have control over the presence (or not) of the ExpandAll tool in the contextual menu of items in the explorer. 
For the moment this tool is hardcoded in the frontend, and is present in the contextual menu of any element that has children. Downstream applications may want to tune this behavior (e.g. it may not be relevant from a UX perspective to ExpandAll some elements that contain a lot of sub-elements). This tuning should be possible from the backend side to allow semantic-based preconditions. The View DSL should be updated to reflect these changes.

### Potential side effects
The current implementation of the ExpandAll in the frontend will evolve to become a Sirius Web component contributed via an extension point. This will have some impact on the Tree API, in particular the `expandAll` and `exapand` functions passed through the hierarchy. 

The ExpandAll logic is used in multiple places in the frontend (in the contextual menu of trees, but also in the _expand all_ button in the reference widget or model browser). The new implementation should ensure that these tools still work.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4373/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create some project on Sirius Web (tested with Flow, Studio, custom domain, Papaya example and blank)
2. Perform a GET on the endpoint [`/api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/changes`](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/commit-rest-controller/getCommitChange)
```py
# for example in python
import requests
resp = requests.get(""http://localhost:8080/api/rest/projects/6ea46518-424f-4b88-bbc1-1afc2887d587/commits/6ea46518-424f-4b88-bbc1-1afc2887d587/changes"")

```

### Expected behavior
Return valid RFC 8259 JSON

For example when no payload is defined return:
```json

### Actual behavior
`""payload""` key with no value associated:

### Unhandled exception

`/api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/roots` and `/api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements` throw an **unhandled exception** in the backend **for instances of custom domain** (Studio?) created in Sirius Web. Thus not returning any JSON but a template HTML.  
This seemed to be caused by a lack of serializer:
```
2025-01-16T12:03:07.218+01:00 ERROR 4604 --- [nio-8080-exec-4] o.a.c.c.C.[.[.[/].[dispatcherServlet]    : Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed: org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageConversionException: Type definition error: [simple type, class org.eclipse.emf.ecore.impl.DynamicEObjectImpl]] with root cause

```  
#### steps to reproduce:
- Create a new Studio (not a blank one)
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5add87a5-5f70-4862-8d37-81483666ce70)
- Create a new blank project 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1a73c7-5e56-45a9-a7fc-e48b226ee6c3)
- Add an object from the previously created Studio 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a5cf349-0bcf-4994-a768-0789bbbf234f)
- access `http://localhost:8080/api/rest/projects/<your-project-id>/commits/<your-project-id>/roots`
- this should throw an exception in the backend as shown above

Yes, please open separate issues for each different point mentioned above in your second response.
But it is not a priority to provide a serializer for the studio/flow/papaya metamodels, so I can't guarantee we will do anything about it.

About the first issue, related to the payload attribute, I will provide a fix soon.

Thank you,

### Expected behavior
cf https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/discussions/4401

Be able to hide/show a group of relation-based Edges from a diagram palette tool.  
In order to do that: have access to the `diagram` variable in a diagram tool context to access Nodes and Edges.

### Cuttings backs

...

### Potential side effects

...

### Describe alternatives you've considered
there is no [according to @AxelRICHARD](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/discussions/4401#discussioncomment-11800260):
> So, is there a service or a way to access relation-based Edges from the ""Expression"" field of a ""Change Context"" tool?

> Unfortunately, no, it's not possible because we don't have added a variable ""diagram"" in this context (https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/view/backend/sirius-components-view-emf/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/components/view/emf/diagram/ViewPaletteProvider.java).
> With this variable, you should have then access to all graphical nodes and edges of the diagram (see https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/diagrams/backend/sirius-components-diagrams/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/components/diagrams/Diagram.java).

The goal of this edit handler is to retrieve from the front-end cell widget ID, the corresponding view cell description where the specifier has described the operations to be performed when a new value is given by the user.
The way the cell parts are built from view DSL to cell widgets in the back-end code makes it difficult to retrieve the view cell description from the front-end cell ID.

### Screenshots

...

### Steps to reproduce
- create a Blank Studio with a simple Entity containing itself:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cff04bf8-30a9-413f-83c4-a705ae5bc992)
- access `http://localhost:8080/api/rest/projects/<your-project-id>/commits/<your-project-id>/roots`

**OR** 

- create a new project from the Flow template
- access `http://localhost:8080/api/rest/projects/<your-project-id>/commits/<your-project-id>/roots`


### Expected behavior

- don't create an infinite loop in the backend => don't reach nesting limit
- return valid JSON
- don't return duplicated elements in the JSON (cf example below with `standard` and `Processor1` from the Flow template through target -> incomingFlows -> target)

### Actual behavior
`/api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/roots` and `/api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements` suffers from **infinite loop** and return **not valid JSON** because of a **nesting depth limit reached** in the backend:
```

### Steps to reproduce
- Create a new Studio (not a blank one)
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5add87a5-5f70-4862-8d37-81483666ce70)
- Create a new blank project 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1a73c7-5e56-45a9-a7fc-e48b226ee6c3)
- Add an object from the previously created Studio 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a5cf349-0bcf-4994-a768-0789bbbf234f)
- access `http://localhost:8080/api/rest/projects/<your-project-id>/commits/<your-project-id>/roots`
- this should throw an exception in the backend as shown above

### Expected behavior

- don't throw an unhandled exception
- warn the user of the lack of serializer for this project
- return a JSON close to what we get *via* the Download feature 

### Actual behavior

`/api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/roots` and `/api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements` throw an **unhandled exception** in the backend **for instances of custom domain** created in Sirius Web. Thus not returning any JSON but a template HTML.  
This seemed to be caused by a lack of serializer:

Just to clarify what you said in #4414 @AxelRICHARD , it's a lack of serializer that causes this issue, but a lack for what component?

Meaning, if I want to hit these endpoints for a project that is an instance of a custom domain (defined by a metamodel built in Sirius Web from a Blank Studio), am I forced to create a dedicated serializer for my metamodel, or can I provide a generic serializer that can handle instances of any domain created by a studio maker in Sirius Web?

A generic one would probably not suits for everybody.

We created an example of a generic serializer (see https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/sirius-web/backend/sirius-web/src/test/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/EObjectSerializerTestConfig.java

### Steps to reproduce
- fetch Sirius Web sources without cloning the git repository 
  in my case I have a dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM maven:3-eclipse-temurin-17 AS backend
  WORKDIR /build/sirius-web
  ADD https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web.git /build/sirius-web
  ```
  which doesn't *clone* the repository but download, and then doesn't have a `.git` folder
- try to compile: `mvn clean install -f packages/pom.xml --settings settings.xml`

### Expected behavior

either:
- if no `.git` folder is found: stop the build warning the user why the test failed and how to skip this one
or
- if no `.git` folder is found: automatically skip the test and emit a warning

### Actual behavior

build fails due to test fail","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4467/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This can happen when implementing a custom action that would redirect to another project from the `EditProjectView`.

### Steps to reproduce

- Create 6 semantic elements of a table
- change the number of rows to 5 in the pagination control
- the sixth row is no longer visible
- click on the next page button
- the sixth row is visible (and alone)
- click on the previous page button
- the five first rows are properly displayed

### Expected behavior

The next page button should not be disabled

### Expected behavior
The behavior is described in [this shape](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/doc/iterations/2025.2/add_support_for_the_import_of_libraries.adoc)

The main goal is to have a new command in the palette that let users import published libraries. 
This command opens a dialog with a table containing the published libraries, and provides actions the user can execute on selected libraries (import as a copy, import in read-only mode, etc).

### Cuttings backs

We will only provide a default action for the first version of the import (import as a copy).

### Expected behavior

The current default implementation of the _createCommit_ REST API does nothing, as Sirius Web does not have a version control system that tracks versions of elements/projects/documents...
But the _createCommit_ REST API is the only way to create/delete/update elements.
So an intermediate solution could be to allow to amend the only commit existing in a project.
Thus, it will allow to create/delete/update elements.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a Papaya Package table with more than 10 rows (10 classes underneath a package for instance)
2. Change Rows per page to 20 to see more than 10 rows
3. try to open the action menu by clicking the `...`  button on the 11th row.

### Expected behavior

The action menu should open without errors and the Delete action should be there.

### Actual behavior

There is a `NullValueInNonNullableField` GraphQL error displayed

The problem is that the TableEventProcessor used by the action menu's event handler is not the correct one. 
It is always the initial one and the table context contains only 10 rows. It has not been updated due to the change of the rows per page setting change.
Pagination information should be part of the table representation ID to make the `EditingContextEventProcessor` able to retrieve the correct TableEventProcessor
