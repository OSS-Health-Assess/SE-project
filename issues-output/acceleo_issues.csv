Inside of it, I have an `EClass` name `A` with an `EAttribute` `name: EString`.

I try to complete the expression `self.`, with a setup like this:

```java
IQueryCompletionEngine engine = QueryCompletion.newEngine(this.queryEnvironment);
Map<String, Set<IType>> variableTypes = new LinkedHashMap<>();
final Set<IType> potentialTypes = new LinkedHashSet<>(1);
potentialTypes.add(new EClassifierType(this.queryEnvironment, selfType));
variableTypes.put(""self"", potentialTypes);
return engine.getCompletion(expression, offset, variableTypes);
```
where `selfType` is my EClass `A`. The parent EPackage is correctly registered in the `queryEnvironment`.

I expect `engine.getCompletion()` to return a completion proposal for `self.name`, but it returns nothing.

After digging into the code and discussing with @ylussaud, here is what seems to happen:

1. We end up (correctly) in `BasicLookupEngine.getServices(Set<IType>)` with the correct values.
2. This code tries to find the service(s) for which `service.getParameterTypes(queryEnvironment).get(0).isAssignableFrom(type)` is `true`.
3. Inside the set of known services, we have an instance of `EObjectServices.EObjectFeatureAccess`, which is the one that should normally handle this.
4. Calling `service.getParameterTypes(queryEnvironment).get(0)` on it returns a `ClassType` representing `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EObject`.
5. `ClassType.isAssignableFrom(IType)` only works for types which exist as Java classes, i.e. for metamodels with generated code.

At step 4, calling `service.getParameterTypes(queryEnvironment)` on `EObjectFeatureAccess` invokes the implementation of `getParameterTypes` from `JavaMethodService.getParameterTypes(IReadOnlyQueryEnvironment)`, which only returns `IJavaType`s.

Not sure if `EObjectFeatureAccess` should override `getParameterTypes` or if `JavaMethodService.getParameterTypes` itself should be updated, but if a type (here `EObject`) is actually an `EClassifier`, it should return an `EClassifierType` instead of a `ClassType`. `EClassifierType.isAssignableFrom()` uses the reflexive EMF APIs and should work correctly on dynamic metamodels.

Upon investigation, the issue was caused by outdated code in acceleo.ide.ui v3.7.15.
Acceleo code is instantiating a no-arg constructor in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.JavaProject class. However, no-arg constructor no longer exist starting jdt.internal.core v3.37.0 (current release).

I have a strange behavior which I just can't understand.

I have this short template.
It works fine except for the if statement.

```
[template` private generate_class_header(class : uml::Class)]
  [file (class.name + '.h', overwrite, 'UTF-8')]
    #pragma once

    [for (dependency | class.clientDependency)]

        ['#include ""' + dependency.supplier.name + '.h""\n'/]
      [/if]
    [/for]
[/template]
```

The editor gives an error:

> The predicate never evaluates to a boolean type ([Sequence(java.lang.Boolean)]).

When I run the script i get the errors:

> ERROR generate L44: The expression must be evaluated to a boolean not: false
> ERROR generate L44: The expression must be evaluated to a boolean not: true
> WARNING generate L52: AQL evaluation issue
> 	WARNING generate L52: Conditional's predicate must evaluate to a boolean value but was [true] instead.

Why does the if never evaluate to a boolean?
The documentation of startsWith states:

> Returns true if the current String starts with the string ""b"".

I have no clue how to understand this:

> ...must evaluate to a boolean value but was [true]...


But, if I put out the predicate just as a line it outputs true or false into the generated files as expected.
What am I getting wrong here? Or could this be a bug?

I think that introducing the capacity of ingoring text will confuse some users. The rigor that Acceleo 4 brings to the management of line breaks is very noteworthy. Introducing the ability to ignore text goes against this rigour.
A new paragraph with illustrations will be needed in the documentation to explain this case, which I feel adds unnecessary complexity.
Case 1 looks much clearer to me. Maybe case 2 is nicer to look at, but that shouldn't be the concern of a developer. Things have to be clear and unambigous. In case 1 we don't have to think about which static text is going to be generated or ignored, it is simpler to understand.
I understand that it impacts performance, but I think it is justified.

I agree that not informing the user when static text in a template doesn't produce any output is problematic. It makes it extremely difficult to understand how the template is functioning and why it's not generating the expected results.

That said, perhaps we can address this issue differently instead of treating it as a validation error.

## Current behavior

When two different Java service classes each provide a service method which have the same name and parameter types, then the resolution depends on the import order.
## Expected behavior

It should be possible to disambiguate these calls, probably using aliases or fully-qualified names.
Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions

In a Capella model, with service classes org.polarsys.capella.core.model.helpers.ProjectExt and org.polarsys.capella.common.helpers.EcoreUtil2, both org.polarsys.capella.core.model.helpers.ProjectExt.getProject(EObject) org.polarsys.capella.common.helpers.EcoreUtil2.getProject(EObject) have the same parameter types and name, so there is no way to explicitly specify which we want to use.
## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?

We can get deadlocked if two service classes each provide two services clashing with the other, and we want to use one service from one service class, and the other service from the other class: because the resolution depends on the import order, only one of the two classes will actually be usable.

I think the current service store replace the old service by the new one. I don't think both of them are kept.

I use Acceleo 4 in a context with pure Maven (no Eclipse Plugins). My generator plugin `org.eclipse.syson.sysml.gen`  is a pure Maven project (no plugin.xml, no META-INF...) and it's part of my team workspace and versioned in our environment. Any update in the generators is then a commit, and everyon gets it as part of the pulls.
The project in which I generate is `org.eclipse.syson.sysml.gen.tests` and I generate calling the Standalone launcher through Maven (There is the Run SysML Generation.launch configuration for that.)
The model is `org.eclipse.syson.sysml.gen.tests/src/test/resources/sysml-json/Batmobile.json` and my Standalone Launcher knows how to load such files.

I did no install tooling in Eclipse beside Acceleo and the Maven tooling, and I don't want to (BTW the SysON project is not providing such plugins). The metamodels I need are only provided as Maven artifacts and are part of the classpath.


As expected, the generation works flawlessly!
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df0e83de-19b1-448b-b289-a2f66345aeed)

But my Acceleo tooling is useless as it does not find the 'http://www.eclipse.org/syson/sysml' EPackage.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/935e3300-e54e-46ee-ac49-446428fc7c54)

This EPackage actually is in the Maven managed classpath, `syson-sysml-metamodel-2024.9.0.jar/model/sysml.ecore` and `org.eclipse.syson.sysml.SysmlPackage.eINSTANCE`

My use case is generating and editing templates using only Maven projects and without needing to install another Eclipse plugin, and it would work if the Acceleo tooling had a way to know that the EPackage it is looking for is in Maven managed classpath.

I get your point about different metamodels and metamodel dependencies, but in this specific case (Java and Maven only) 
I would be happy if all comes from the classpath and only the classpath, it's not a plugin project,  I don't expect magic to happen. That being said a way to make the ""nsURI"" resolution explicit would be nice, and I agree it would make sense at the project level.

Here is an archive containing the two projects which are supposed to be ""self contained"" as their pom.xml are declaring all the dependencies.

* OCL has been replaced with [AQL](https://github.com/eclipse-acceleo/acceleo/blob/master/query/plugins/org.eclipse.acceleo.query.doc/input/index.textile) (for services references you can also have a look at [this page](https://eclipse.dev/acceleo/documentation/aql.html) the other page should soon includes service references).
* The indentation policy has changed to introduce mandatory indentation in the template that can be distinguished from the indentation in the generated document. Also blocks of code are inserted in a way they keep the caller indentation by repeating the last generated line if needed. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/eclipse-acceleo/acceleo/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.acceleo.aql.doc/pages/language.adoc#white-spaces). This explains the two first characters that are not in the generated output.
* The compilation to emtl has been removed.
* The main comment moved outside of the template (I though it was also the case in Acceleo 3...).

For more details about Acceleo 4, you can check the [documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-acceleo/acceleo/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.acceleo.aql.doc/toc.adoc). If you are migrating from Acceleo 3 check the [migration section](https://github.com/eclipse-acceleo/acceleo/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.acceleo.aql.doc/pages/migration.adoc) that also include more details on changes between Acceleo 3 and 4.

Also note that since the first release of Acceleo 4 we have been busy fixing a wide range of small annoying bugs and improve user experience (there is now an error marker and a quick fix when the template indentation is missing). Those fixes are not release yet but you can benefit from them by using the [last nightly build](https://download.eclipse.org/acceleo/updates/nightly/latest/).

Here's the setup:

**Template 1**: *mainSpringJpa.mtl*
```
[module mainSpringJpa('http://www.eclipse.org/uml2/5.0.0/UML')/]

[import it::example::com::springjpa::mainClass/]

[template public genSpringJpaMain(aModel : uml::Model)]

**Template 2**: *mainClass.mtl*

[template public genMainClass()]
    [file ('example.txt', overwrite, 'UTF-8')]
        Example
    [/file]
[/template]
```

The first template calls the *genMainClass* method, which doesn't take any arguments, but I get the following error when executing the first template:

""Couldn't find the 'genMainClass(null)' service.""

How can I call a parameterless method from one template in another template? 
Could you provide a simple example of how to achieve this?

1. I am using Acceleo version 4.0 inside Eclipse.
2. Both templates are imported correctly.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-acceleo/acceleo/issues/181/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
