my development environment ist eclipse mars latest cdt and gnuarmeclipse plugin and all things are working pretty. Now i would like to add a gdbinit file like old settings from pure gdb sessions. In my old environment i add a .gdbinit with following settings:

```
define hook-step
mon cortex_m3 maskisr on
end
define hookpost-step
mon cortex_m3 maskisr off
end
```

In the source file ilg.gnuarmeclipse.debug.gdbjtag.jlink/src/ilg/gnuarmeclipse/debug/gdbjtag/jlink/Configuration.java at line 276 is a comment that these settings are set in the LaunchSequence.  Now i thing that the arm-none-eabi-gdb --interpreter=mi2 --nx process on linux is a client process, so i look in the main documentation from JLinkGdbServer for information to handle the maskisr on and of function.

My question: can you tell me some examples how i can enable maskisr?

Another cool topic:
Now i have test some settings to flash a binary into the LPC1768 chip with J-Link, here are my results:

You can  set up a External Tools RUN configuration in eclipse to start the JLinkExe program directly  with parameter to flash a bin file directly in ROM. So you don't need to start a debug session for the same result and it is very fast.

unfortunately not, perhaps a better place to ask J-Link related questions is SEGGER support.

I'm using the Eclipse plugin for debugging with a SEGGER JLink Debugger.
Up until now everything worked fine.

I'm using several STM32F4 microcontrollers.

However, a few weeks ago the arm-none-eabi-gdb was updated to version 7.10-2. Now the Eclipse plugin can't debug anymore.

I get this error:

Error in final launch sequence
Failed to execute MI command:
-exec-run
Error message from debugger back end:
Don't know how to run.  Try ""help target"".
Don't know how to run.  Try ""help target"".

Changing back to the older GDB version 7.9 helps. However, this version is compiled with old dependencies and cannot longer be used on my system. 

The output of the JLinkGDBServer shows, that it waits for a connection. This means that GDB isn't even connecting to the server.

Using GDB manually everything works fine. Therefore I think it's a problem with the plugin.

How can I solve this issue?

Best regards

can you try a debug session with the latest version of the GDB Hardware Debugging plug-in, from the standard Eclipse distribution?

if it is supported and works properly, it'll be easier to update my plug-ins. if not, we'll have to wait for official support in Eclipse.

- Start openocd session in an external terminal
- Start debug session in eclipse (gdb 7.8 installed) using the external openocd session
- Copy gdb trace output
- Stop debug session in eclipse
- Remove gdb 7.8 and install 7.10
- Start a new debug session in eclipse using the same external openocd session
- Copy gdb trace output

Both had the same debug configuration in eclipse. I did not even restart eclipse between the two debug sessions and as I already said the openocd session was always the same.
I don't know what I could do to have less differences. Please let me know if you have a suggestion.

Just an other remark: After starting a debug session with the gdb 7.10 version it shows the error and after that I'm unable to restart a new debug session because it tells me that there is already a debug session running. It's impossible to terminate this session. The only thing that helps is restarting eclipse.

if there is any problem, I guess it is in the openocd scripts, which are totally out of my control.

I suggest you check this by trying to connect to another board, preferably a common STM board.

as for the message, MI is not a command, but the protocol used by gdb to talk to the gdb server, so the entire dialog is a sequence of MI commands and mentioning the text ""Failed to execute MI command:"" is not very helpful.

the other JTAG message  ""JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR"" tells that the JTAG communication failed, probably with the data pin locked, and is also very common when something goes wrong.

are you sure all those many jumpers on the board are set correctly?

I've got a J-Link on its way, but I'm fearful that the same problem will still be present.

I think the jumpers must be correct because I can get it working via the command prompt.
Based on that, I feel confident that it's something very trivial that I've missed with the Eclipse setup. This is my first time running stock Eclipse so there are many things that I'm recently coming up to speed with.

what Tool Settings you would like to set for a **Makefile project**?

the only setting available for unmanaged projects is the toolchain, used by the indexer, and this setting, as seen before, is available.

the rest of the settings are available only for managed C/C++ projects.

Most complex makefiles have hand-written rules that cannot be automatically generated by Eclipse.

The mistake in your approach was to use **Import** -> **Existing Code as Makefile Project** instead of **Import** -> **General** -> **Existing Projects into Workspace**. Always use _Existing Projects_ for projects created by Eclipse, regardless of their type  (i.e. if you have a `.project` file, possibly a `.cproject` file for C/C++ projects, Eclipse will know its type and how to import it). Use _Existing Code as Makefile Project_ only for projects that were created manually, and have a Makefile but do not have a `.project` file.

I am happy to see the project migrated to github, the new site is great as well :)!

I would like to bring up front the case with automatic disconnect feature after successful run again. I am working heavilly with you plugin now and I notice that this feature would be really usefull and would improve work a lot (at least in my opinion). I was wondering either it would be possible for you to add a checkbox in the debug configuration maybe so that after checking it, after a run configuration is used, JLINK would automatically disconnect from target?

The plugin is great at this point, so thank you anyways :).

You mean to disconnect from the target, and leave it running? I thought that, if the target is running, it will remain running, and this should already be implemented. I don't know what should happen if the target is halted, I'm not sure it should continue or not.

I'd like to use J-Link debugger/probe in LPCXpresso.

Segger [suggests](https://www.segger.com/nxp-lpcxpresso.html) to use GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins as I did just now.

**First problem**: I can't see Devices tab in the Settings window of project Properties. It seems this is not mandatory, so I didn't care about it.

I created a new Debug Configuration and set the cross_prefix substring (as indicated by Segger in this [link](https://www.segger.com/nxp-lpcxpresso.html)).

**Second problem**: when I launch the debug session, the error **Error while launching command: arm-none-eabi-gdb --version** appears. I think gdb client can't be found, so I changed the executable from ${cross_prefix}gdb${cross_suffix} to C:\nxp\LPCXpresso_7.9.2_493\lpcxpresso\tools\bin\arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe.

Now it seems to work.

as you noticed, that's because the toolchain path is not set. the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins use an elaborated mechanism to set the toolchain path, that does not match the LPCXpresso mechanism.

I'm not sure if there is anything to do to make things easier, but any suggestions are welcome.

nope. Eclipse calls the process with an array of strings for argv[], the quotes are required only for the shell (cmd.exe for Windows users), to split the line intro separate strings.

there must be another problem.

I've just come across GNU ARM Eclipse today and have set it up according to the documentation and have used this plugin. Eclipse tries to execute the following `/Applications/GNU\ ARM\ Eclipse/OpenOCD/0.10.0-201510281129-dev/bin/openocd -c gdb_port 3333 -c telnet_port 4444 -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg -c echo ""Started by GNU ARM Eclipse""`, the same as the problem already discussed here with the same error.
This is what happens when I run the above in a terminal:

```

Modifying the command to `/Applications/GNU\ ARM\ Eclipse/OpenOCD/0.10.0-201510281129-dev/bin/openocd -c gdb_port 3333 -c telnet_port 4444 -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg` (dropping the echo) produces what I believe to be workable results complete with blinking lights from the STLink portion of my Discovery board (STM32F429I) (I've yet to get my board flashed and running from inside Eclipse, still setting up the toolchain, so I'm not sure of what's meant to happen):

if you think there is a problem with the plug-in, you need to provide enough information to reproduce the problem.

> It's this plugin that appends -c echo ""Started by GNU ARM Eclipse"" and I have no way that I can see of telling it not to

why would you want to tell it not to?

passing commands on the command line with `-c` is perfectly legal, the `echo` command is implemented in the standard OpenOCD, so it is not a problem use it; I don't understand all the fuss around this command; when you start OpenOCD by hand you don't need to use it, because the plug-in does not wait for it; the plug-in waits for this message only when it starts the OpenOCD itself, because OpenOCD has no other way of notifying the plug-in it is ready to accept connections. if, for any reasons, you want to enter the `echo` command by hand, just quote the entire content.

I suggest you do a clean test, remove all other OpenOCD except the last one, install a clean Eclipse, create a new workspace, generate a new blinky project with the F4 template and try again.

if it still does not work, create a new ticket, provide all details, provide the openocd logs, the gdb traces, etc, and be sure you do not blame the echo command again, since it has nothing to do with your problem.

explicitly, this means:
- go to the debug perspective
- select the .elf process, in the top left window
- click the toolbar red square terminate button

this is the normal way to terminate any debugging session.

clicking the terminate button in the console window just kills the associated process.

similarly, selecting another process in the top left window and clicking the toolbar terminate, kills that process, not the application.

the plug-in has a lot of logic to detect when one of the processes dies or is brutally killed, to terminate the application and the other processes, but if you just kill directly the J-Link GDB server, it is simply gone, don't expect a graceful termination.

The reason is probably the one mentioned by SEGGER, the terminating logic is quite complicated, and it is quite likely that the process is finally killed.

But the point is completely different: why does a background process display a tray icon at all? In my opinion it shouldn't, and this would simply avoid the problem.

I am writing a tool to do some extra debugging and essentially it is a proxy server that sits between the GNU arm eclipse GDB client handling and the JLink GDB server. So basically instead of having the GNU ARM eclipse debug configuration launch jlinkgdbservercl, it launches my tool. My tool then internally launches jlinkgdbservercl and connects to it. The GDB client from eclipse then sends server GDB RSP commands to my tool and I forward them back and forth between jlinkgdbservercl. This works perfectly. However when I press the terminate button as you have suggested in the debug perspective, the JLink GDB server tray icon stays in the bottom right until I hover over it and it disappears, because the actual jlinkgdbserver process has been killed incorrectly. 

The reason this happens is because I have figured out that something is forcibly terminating my tool process, and the only thing that would do that is the GNU ARM eclipse Jlink plugin OR the GDB client. I don't think its the GDB client. The reason I know my process is being forcibly terminated when I press the terminate button in the debug perspective is that I have a while loop inside my tool that keeps the program alive under all circumstances. The only thing that can kill my tool process is a task kill from another process or the task manager. 

If you just run jlinkgdbservercl instead of my tool, upon the terminate action, the tray icon stays in the bottom right.

Here is a test you can run: Open jlinkgdbservercl from the command line with proper arguments (make sure you have -singlerun) and connect to a jlink and then see the ""waiting for gdb connection..."" text. Connect to the jlinkgdbserver through a client and then disconnect from the client and notice that the JLink GDB server shuts down gracefully. Run the jlinkgdbservercl from the command line again.. and now instead of connecting through a client, forcibly kill the jlinkgdbservercl process from the task manager. You will notice the tray icon is still there until you hover over it (this bug).

From the previous discussion, I am 99% sure this is a problem in the GNU ARM Jlink plugin and not segger's jlinkgdbserver. If any program has a tray icon and you forcibly kill the process associated with it in task manager, you will notice the exact same behavior where the tray icon stays until you hover over it. In this case, this is a windows issue where the tray icon is not cleaned up when the process is killed... Nonetheless the plugin is killing the process forcibly instead of just disconnecting from the server session and letting jlinkgdbserver kill itself because of the -singlerun option.

I have peered through the plugin source code before, so I think I will peer again and see how the termination logic is. I am fairly certain the plugin is forcibly killing the server. 

One way to fix this problem would be to... not forcibly kill the process and just disconnect from the server as suggested above. Another potential option that I am investigating is launching a stub or set of stub processes before I launch my tool that the plugin will be allowed to kill forcibly. The stub launches my tool and my tool monitors the stub to see if the plugin killed the process then shuts down gracefully as it should.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTQyNjAxNw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the complication is due to not having a single termination logic, but many. each red square button is associated to one process, and pressing it terminates, more or less abruptly, that process. 

each such termination should also handle the termination of the other processes, and here is probably where the wrong logic may be.

if you want to help fixing this, please take a look at the code and suggest changes.

Those would probably be the areas I would start with. The point of the jlinkgdbserver -singlerun option is that the jlink gdb server will terminate automatically once all server connections are lost, which makes it a nice option. All you essentially have to do in the code is not call the destroy and only terminate the socket connection to the server and that would fix the issue. Since the connection to the jlink gdb server is lost, it dies on its own. 

I may have a play around with the source code at some point, but I would rather explore my own option with the process stub. I am an outsider looking in and as such, I don't like messing with the source code of plugins made by other groups. Also, I am not versed in DSF architecture, and the plugin code seems fairly complicated. As some background, I am really a .NET guy and I don't have a ton of experience with java.

I am not sure how you are terminating the server at this point. So as a first guess, I would say that you are launching the jlink gdb server and then making a server socket connection to it. Then when you want to terminate the server, you forcibly kill the process and you get an exception when trying to read from the socket, which then you handle as a terminate.

If the above is the case, then instead of forcibly killing the process, what you should do instead is just close the socket connection by doing it explicitly - remove all the destroy process calls and replace with socket.close or whatever. This should cause the same exception to appear on the socket read in the same way as killing the process.

What you have stated however cannot be as obvious as it seems, therefore, I don't think we are on the same page. 

What I think you are saying is that each different termination button in the debug perspective is associated with different termination logic. As far as I know, there are 2 possible red buttons I am aware of: The main one at the top left and another one in the console view on the bottom right. I couldn't care less about the button on the  console view, but rather the main red terminate button everybody uses in the top left. 

After doing some further investigation, it seems like the termination logic is not only killing the associated GDB server process, but killing the 'process tree' in windows. I am not sure if this is a java implementation thing or it's explicitly done like this in the plugin. I have to assume it is a java thing, because as far as the plugin is concerned, there is only one process being launched, not multiple behind the scenes. 

The reason I found out that the process tree is being killed is because I tried making a stub program that sits between jlinkgdbserver and the gnu jlink plugin. The gnu jlink plugin launches the stub and then the stub launches the jlinkgdbserver. My expectation was that the gnu jlink plugin would only terminate the stub; however, it terminates both the stub and any spawned process from the stub. One can kill spawned processes of a parent process in windows by killing the 'process tree'. 

As a result of the previous bad behavior, I have investigated an option where I create the jlinkgdbserver as a child of another process and not my stub. Therefore the plugin launches my stub then my stub launches jlinkgdbserver as a child of explorer.exe. When the plugin terminates the server, jlinkgdbserver gets terminated correctly as it is not a child of the stub which the plugin forcibly terminates.

I am not going to scour the plugin source anymore. I have looked at it for a few hours, and if my suspicion is correct, it would be very complicated to change how the server process is terminated no less than rewriting half the plugin. I guess I have to leave the analysis and implementation up to the experts if the issue is to be fixed :)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTYxOTgzOA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

from what I can read in your message, we aren't.

that's correct

> it seems like the termination logic is not only killing the associated GDB server process, but killing the 'process tree' in windows

here is where you miss the details. there is not **one** termination logic, but 4 different ones, associated to the processes in the 'process tree' as you call it:

![debug-processes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/362732/28250535-a9df747c-6a73-11e7-9595-7f459010f235.png)

each of the 4 processes has a monitoring thread associated; some also have a console.

when you press the top red button, it sends the terminate request **to the process selected** in the tree. to be sure that things are clear: if you select the thread or one of the lines below it and press the top red Terminate button, an event is sent to an internal java thread monitoring the debug; if you select JLinkGDBServer and press the same Terminate button, the event is sent to the thread monitoring JLinkGDBServer, which in turn sends a terminate signal to the external process; if you select arm-none-eabi-gdb and press the Terminate button, the event is sent to the thread monitoring arm-none-eabi-gdb, which in turn sends a terminate signal to the external process; if you select Semihosting and SWV, the event is sent to an internal java thread that telnets to the semihosting port and forwards output to the console.

a similar logic is executed when you press the Terminate button in the console: it sends an event to the monitoring thread associated with the selecte/active console, which might be JLinkGDBServer, arm-none-eabi-gdb or the smihosting thread.

so selecting the gdb client or JLinkGDBServer and pressing Terminate is somehow similar to going to the system process viewer and sending the terminate signal. 

the complicated logic is in the monitoring thread associated with the debug session (the Thread entry), which normally should issue a command to the gdb client, which should issue a command to the server an then disconnect the socket from the server.

apparently somehting wrong happens at that moment, and the JLinkGDBServer is abruptly terminated.

I'll reopen this and, time permitting, try to take a look at the termination logic.

I am concerned with the red #2 item, the jlinkgdbserver. When I say 'process tree', I mean Win32 process tree not related to eclipse but the real process tree on the computer. To use your explanation, when the thread monitoring the jlinkgdbserver process terminates, it terminates the 'entire' win32 process tree associated with the jlinkgdbserver, not just the server. This means for example, if I make a proxy application (which I have explained above) and have the plugin launch it thinking it is jlinkgdbservercl.exe, when the plugin terminates it, it will also terminate any process launched from my proxy app.

So
1. Plugin launches proxy app (my exe. Looks and feels like jlinkgdbservercl.exe)
2. My proxy app launches the actual jlinkgdbservercl.exe internally and pipes its output to the std output of my proxy app.
3. Plugin connects to my proxy app thinking its jlinkgdbservercl.exe and gets the exact same output. 

As you can see, my app launches win32 'child' process internal to it. So the hierarchy looks like this in terms of processes:

Eclipse -> Plugin -> proxy app -> jlinkgdbservercl.exe

When the plugin terminates the proxy app, I expect the process tree to now look like this:

Eclipse -> Plugin ->              -> jlinkgdbservercl.exe.

But instead it looks like this:

Eclipse -> Plugin ->               ->

Why? Because in my research, the termination logic for jlinkgdbserver in the plugin is killing the win32 'process tree' and not just the direct launched child (proxy.exe). LIke I was saying, this could be a java implementation thing. 

Regardless, the termination logic for the thread monitoring the ""jlinkgdbserver"" is forcibly terminating the win32 'process tree' when it executes. 

Now, this could be a bear of an issue to fix based on how the logic is in the plugin, which is why I went with a different approach to fixing the problem for my specific use case.

My specific use case is that I want to have the plugin launch a proxy server that internally filters all of the RSP GDB packets coming to it from the plugin and then passes them to jlinkgdbservercl which I launch internally to my proxy app. So to do this, I create the proxy app with a server that the plugin can connect to just like the jlinkgdbserver and then read all of the packets from the plugin and pass them back and forth to jlinkgdbserver. The proxy app is being to used to create a custom debug extension window separate from eclipse and I need to be able tell when the plugin stops, halts, steps, the debugged CPU when the user presses the debug buttons in the eclipse debug perspective (pause, run, etc.). I have the proxy portion completed and it actually works quite well. The issue comes into play when I need to 'gracefully' shutdown the proxy server because it needs to save some user data on shutdown that might have changed while debugging. Of course, forcibly terminating my proxy server and associated child processes spawned from it (jlinkgdbserver.exe being one of them) means I can't gracefully shutdown and the jlinkgdbserver tray icon incorrectly shows in the bottom right. Not exactly a good user experience :)

really? do you explicitly select the JLinkGDBServer entry before clicking the Terminate button? the usual way is to leave the Thread entry selected.

> When I say 'process tree', I mean Win32 process tree not related to eclipse but the real process tree on the computer. 

I don't know the windows implementation details of the Java classes, but on POSIX there is no such thing. the java class calls some kind of exec(...) to start a new process and gets a process id. to terminate that process, it send the SIG_TERMINATE signal to it.

I remember that on windows the implementation was somehow different (more complicated and unusual), but I don't remember the details.

Windows has a slight notion of a process tree. Every process is inherently 'independent' in that they can all execute alone. If you shut one of them down through the task manager, any spawned processes from the original will not get shut down and will just keep running.. that is unless you end the 'process tree'. When you create a process in a windows program, the process spawned is a child process and the program that spawned the child is the parent. This is where the 'process tree' is built from for the 2 processes - they form a hierarchy. If the child launches processes itself, they get attached to the hierarchy as well. 

Now the really odd thing is that you have process A which spawns B and B spawns C.

So it looks like this process tree: 

A(grandparent) -> B (parent) -> C (child).

If you terminate process B, the  tree looks like this:

A (original grandparent) -> -> C (root). 

So if you break the process tree linkage anywhere in between the two ends of the hierarchy, you can actually create processes which become ""roots"" and they are now the eldest parent in the chain. This means if I then terminate the process tree using process A above, it will now not kill process C, because C became a root by killing B. Kinda funny. 

Using this same idea, the solution for me is to have a 2 stubs that spawn my proxy. So I spawn stub1 which sits at the top, this is what the plugin interacts with directly for stdout. Then Stub1 spawns process stub2, then stub2 spawns the proxy process. Stub1 then connects to the proxy and then terminates stub2. This creates the same breakage in the tree hierarchy I explained above and now the proxy is a root process that won't be forcibly terminated when the plugin terminates Stub1.

it probably isn't. but we never know until the code is thouroughly checked.

right now I'm updating the project to support the new RISC-V architecture; J-Link is not yet available for RISC-V, but it is expected to be, hopefully in a matter of weeks.

after this, together with the RISC-V team, we'll evaluate the changes required in the J-Link plug-in and, depending on other things we discover, if the problem you are reporting can be easily reproduced, I'll probably address it too.

so, without commiting on a date, it might happen sometime this summer/autumn.

if the Cube examples are makefile projects, you can import them as any other makefile projects.

It'd be incredibly helpful if there could be at least some pointers to possibly existing tutorials how to achieve this conversion. I've been wasting hours trying to manually reconstruct some of the STM32F4Cube projects by copying files... but there's got to be a better way! Alas not much info to be found for setting up virtual source folders and configure exclusion settings for CDT. Would it maybe make sense to create a ticket specifically for this use case? Thanks Liviu!

I'm already appreciating the work done with the templates. Without it, I would have given up learning ARM development a long time ago. ;)

It's just a tad difficult trying to get the STM32F4Cube projects running out of the box. As part of the learning process, I'm also wanting to learn how to setup a STM32F4 project from scratch. Once I understand the basics of ldscripts and how the startup stuff works before main(), I'll be more at ease with using templates.

As for CubeMX projects, when I configure my project, I keep the changes aside, git tag them and diff out the changes made and I manually apply them to my project.

This way I ""know my code"", and aren't left completely to the mercies of code generators. Which is also why I like GNU ARM Eclipse, no weird wizards trying to take over the whole project.

actually there is no such thing as a _newlib startup lifecycle_, in other words there is nothing in newlib that requires special inits (maybe except some file descriptors when using semihosting, but this is a single call).

the startup sequence I used in my projects is quite standard: the data is copied, the bss section is initialised, constructors are executed, arguments are prepared, `main()` is called, if returned the processor soft reset is used (or the semihosting exit routine is called with the exit code).

the only embedded specific thing is the code to initialise the hardware, split into two routines, one executed very early, intended to activate RAM, if needed, and one after the data & bss are initialised.

> Where can I read more 

the best place to read more is the source code itself. in the debug configuration, move the initial breakpoint from `main` to `_start` and you'll be able to step through the entire startup sequence. actually, to save time, I suggest to avoid stepping through the loops, it is much better to place breakpoint over the loops.

I don't know, but there probably are some, ask Google.

but things are really simple, by default managed projects just compile all source files found in the project.

if you need more control, it is recommended to remove the project folder from the list of source folders, and add a more specific one, like `src`. the build plug-in will parse all folders in the list of source folders and compile all files that can be compiled.

if the include headers are located in the project folder, they are automatically found by the compiler. if the headers are in separate folders, like `include`, you need to add these folders to the list of included folders.

so for _civilised_ projects, you can easily convert them to managed by defining the source folders and include folders.

generally you can automate this using the three-way-merge feature, also available in git.

for this you start in the empty repository with two branches with a common ancestor, one with originals, one with your changes, usually master. from time to time you update the originals, then merge them into the master.

an example of a repository using this approach can be the newly created [xpacks/stm32f4-cmsis](https://github.com/xpacks/stm32f4-cmsis), where I plan to maintain a much smaller STM32F4 pack, but still be able to update when ST issues a new release.

Normally all you should do is
- close Eclipse
- remove the `Packages/.cache` folder
- restart Eclipse

Since the CMSIS Packs use huge XMLs, the Pack Manager caches some relevant data in the `.cache` folder. If, for any reason, this cache gets corrupted, the simple way to fix it is to remove this folder.

If this does not help, the ultimate solution is to remove the entire `Packages` folder.

I have been using the gnuarmeclipse plug-ins for some time, developing on the STM32F107 using c. The tools are excellent. Thank you.

Using the default STM32F10x template, it appears that everything in the /system folder (including CMSIS, the standard peripheral libraries, etc) is being excluded from Eclipse's Code Analyzer.

Sometimes Eclipse will have a problem and I'll get a bunch of warnings from one or more of the files in /system. I can get rid of these errors by rebuilding the Eclipse index and then restarting Eclipse.

Now, however, I have warnings that I cannot make go away.  Please see the screenshot. These are spawned by Eclipse's CODAN, not by the gcc toolchain. These just started showing up. I have a different project built with the same template that doesn't show these errors.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5828532/10771887/954916c4-7cb0-11e5-8c9b-a1874a446236.png)

Do you have any ideas for me? I do not want to disable the code analyzer entirely.

Thank you.

the plug-ins do not explicitly exclude anything from the indexer/analyser. actually they ignore the analyser entirely, and this might be the problem, perhaps there are some settings required for the analyser to work properly, settings that are not performed by the template project wizard.

unfortunately I have no experience with the code analyser, so if you discover how to fix the projects, I can update the wizards.

I suggest you start with very simple projects, created with the hello world template, and, if they work properly, increase complexity, checking differences in the .project/.cproject files, in the gui settings, etc.

This is interesting because _only occasionally_ will the analyser show warnings from a subset of files in the spl, or in the cmsis directories.  As I mentioned, these warnings stop being displayed after a re-index and then an Eclipse restart...  It doesn't seem to be the same files or the same types of warnings. And when these warning are _not_ being displayed, I still get warnings on files in my /src and /include directories.

Makes me wonder why the analyser usually _doesn't_ display the warnings!

It'll be a few weeks before I have time to work on it further.  I expect you'll want to close this issue in the mean time.  If I discover anything, would you prefer an email or should I create a new Issue? (Or, can I comment on a closed issue?)

the updated toolchain definition will be used for new projects. existing projects will continue to use their definitions stored in the `.cproject` file, until you update them (for example by selecting another toolchain and returning to the desired one).

that's correct.

if you want to define and implement an extension point to add custom toolchains, I can consider it for integration into the plug-ins.

another problem is that not all cores have the memory buffers to store the samples, and the alternative, to use the multi-bit trace interface requires expensive probes.

my priority would be:
- get the events (interrupt entry/exit), 
- get data trace (monitor ram locations that change)
- get the instruction trace.

it is on my TODO list, but unless someone else will support the development, it has low priority.

thanks for your quick answer.
I agree on the difficulties to display the trace information. Have you seen any charting solutions that might fit the needs?
as far as I understand, for most (hardware) tracing, no buffers are needed since the information is streamed out via TPIU and the core gets stalled once to FIFO is full

what would you suggest on how to configure the trace functionality?

two possible solutions I think of are:
- python gdb scripts writing to the trace registers in the processor?
  - this would not need code changes on the target but maybe lots of different scripts on the host to configure the trace registers
- a processor depended trace library which provides a set of unified function names across processors to configure the trace unit
  - to start PC sampling you may could write ""call gnuarm_trace_start_pc_samping"" in your gdb console and have the plattform specific action  executed on the target.

maybe the multi-bit trace interface could also be accessed with a logic analyzer like it is shown here:
http://essentialscrap.com/tips/arm_trace/theory.html

one then would not need a expensive debugger but a logic analyzer software with live decode functionality. don't know is sigrok supports that.

yes, I liked the way the former CodeRed displayed events and data trace. I guess LPCExpress inherited these features too, but I did not test them.

> what would you suggest on how to configure the trace functionality?

I would check the information available in SVD + PDSC and directly set the registers. 

the setting should happen in the debugging plug-in, not in the application.

as it is now implemented, the, the ITM trace is processed by J-Link and printed in the console; it works quite fine.

please check the SEGGER manual for more details.

this might work, but I don't consider it a professional approach.

I think SWO might be available on other MCUs too.

I can see in the log-window that ""something"" is happening (see log below). But the processor doesn't start over. It seems, that the processor just starts running where it was stopped.

The failing system is:
Eclipse: Version: Mars.1 Release (4.5.1) Build id: 20150924-1200

I tried it with Segger-Jlink Software V4.98e and V5.02g. Both behave the same under Luna and Mars, So this doesn't seem to be the culprit.

This is the log of the failing setup (Mars) after the processor was already halted:

Win 7 Pro 64 bit

And after that, I noticed the same behaviour as on Eclipse Mars.
So maybe this is related to the version 3.2.1.201511061603 of Gnu Arm Eclipse?
The sequence was:
Create blinky example with template for STM32F051R8 (STM32F0 discovery board was used).
Compile, Create debug configuration,
Set breakpoint at line 81 (timer_sleep(BLINK_OFF_TICKS);)
Debug, Run (breakpoint will be hit), Click restart button

I really miss that functionality at the moment.

As i said in my last post, It does not seem to be related to MARS 1.
It also doesn't work in Luna, since I updated the Gnu Am Eclipse Plugin to the v2.10.2-201511061603 release.

it takes just a few minutes to follow the tutorial: http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/tutorials/blinky-arm/

> What about your setup when you confirmed the bug?

it was either very late in the night and I did not know what doing, or there is a possible configuration when Restart does not work.

the Eclipse debugging plug-ins suffer from interferences between projects, so the tests must be done with a single open project in the workspace.

So maybe something strange with my workspace?
To be honest, I am surprised that it seems that I am the only one that reports this bug. Because I consider the restart button an often used feature.

I will do some more tests with different versions.

ok, then I proceed with the release

> as soon as I used my workspace, the restart button stopped working

once something goes wrong and the workspace becomes corrupted, usually it is easier to dispose than fix. this does not mean it can't be fixed (in fact most of the files are properties and xmls), just that there are no clear tools and/or procedures to follow.

from my experience, avoid opening a workspace with different versions Eclipses, especially different platform Eclipses.

try to import your project in a new workspace and work there. if you need other plug-ins, install them one by one and check after each install if the Restart button is still functional.

I only use two addtional plugins, Bracketeer and LaunchBar. Meanwhile I installed both in the new workspace and everything is still working.

I guess you did something wrong. Could you follow the [blinky](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/tutorials/blinky-arm/) tutorial and confirm that you see the STM32F4 registers when debugging under QEMU.

Then you assign the Atmel device to the same project, and restart the debug session. You should see the Atmel registers now.

the debug plug-in is generally guaranteed to work with programs built by the managed build plug-in, which set the debug options more accurately, for makefile projects it is sometimes tricky.

to check this, run a GDB debug session from the terminal, outside Eclipse. if it behaves similarly, you probably do not have the debug info in the executable. if it works, it means there is a difference in the way you invoked GDB manually, and you need to configure Eclipse to start GDB similarly.

This error is the exactly one I got from command-line GDB.

I don't know whether there are other changes in makefile can be tried as I don't understand it's structure very much.

and in this case why do you expect the GDB running under Eclipse to behave differently?

regardless how much I would like it, the GNU ARM Eclipse tools cannot make miracles.

please fix your project, and when it behaves properly with the command-line GDB, return to using Eclipse.

As you said this problem have no relationship with GNU ARM Eclipse tools .

I'm analysing the makefiles and script files of u-boot and trying to change the compiling and linking options.

But I got no progress so far.

It seems that all the C codes will make GDB performed abnormal. When the progress run back to assambler codes GDB will  performe normal again.

Maybe I should also diggin by analysing the object files generated by C files by dissasambling them.

Or is there any possibility that c source files contain some special characters that GDB can't understand? 

I'll update this post asap when I got any progress.

""be aware that once a toolchain is added, it is expected to be always available[...] toolchains are identified by name; I don't know what happens if the name stored in .cproject is no longer available""

I tested and in case the toolchain is not found (by name) the Settings page becomes invalid (the UI is not even depicted). The fix is easy, to return the first toolchain in the array as you suggested. Although this scenario isn't common at all, I'm thinking that user should be notified about this (the toolchain his/her project is configured with was not found and a default selection was made). Where do you think such a warning/info message should be placed:
1. as a global message in the Settings page (upper area), managed by Toolchains tab
2. as a simple message in the Toolchains tab (new label control in the bottom area)
3. validation decorator in the toolchains combo box (Toolchains tab)
4. other ideas?

According to the instructions at http://embeddedsoftdev.blogspot.com/p/ehal-nrf51.html, I can use Eclipse to do this.

On my Windows 7 Pro laptop, I've installed Eclipse, Java 8, GCC for ARM embedded, ARM Eclipse plugins, and ARM Toolchain, so far. When I get to the build tools (make & rm v2.6), I run into problems. 

After running the setup wizard and successfully checking its version with ""make --version"" command, I went to check the global tools path as instructed in the directions (http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/windows-build-tools/install/), but found the ""Global Tools Paths"" area in Eclipse Preferences windows is not there. The instructions to check if the paths definitions are effective, point to C/C++ Build/Environment - here again, my list of environment variables is blank.

Tried installing an older version of the build tools (2.4) and tried again - same result.

Attached are screen shots of the instructions and my Eclipse installation screens for both the Global Tools Paths issue as well as the environment variables issue.

the problem is not related to the tools, but to the plug-ins.

are you sure the plug-ins installed without problems?  can you check About Eclipse -> Installation Details -> Installed Software, then Plug-ins.  there should be about 22 plug-ins. 

if not, in the plug-ins page, please enter 'ilg' in the filtering field and capture the list of plug-ins. attach it here directly, do not use .doc files, since they are not portable.

you can also check the Eclipse log for exceptions; the logs are in the workspace, the .metadata folder.

I have been using Arm Gnu Eclipse plugin together with a OpenSTM32 plugin for a while and it worked ok. I generated project in CubeMx and imported it to eclipse using OpenSTM32 plugin. Then built it with the same plugin compiller. I then used Arm Gnu Eclipse only for jlink configuration and debugging.
And today i discovered a huge problem- I cannot see registers view... Both plugins got it covered but it wont work together. I cannot use Packs from Arm Gnu Eclipse, because there is no Device section in the project, as the project is made by OpenSTM32 plugin. Also I cannot see registers from OpenSTM32 plugin, as I am using Jlink not ST-Link... I am stuck.

I was wondering, do you know any workaround for this situation maybe, so I could use Packs with OpenSTM32 project? I would really rather use the Arm Gnu Eclipse project structure but I cannot import project from CubeMX to it... :(
Is there a solution? I would apreciate all help!

yes, there are several options, but not particularly convenient, since they require to reconfigure the Eclipse project.

depending on your project, you may opt to generate only the initialisation code in CubeMX and copy/paste it into an existing GNU ARM Eclipse project, then configure the source path, include path and preprocessor symbols.

if you like CubeMX and feel confident with Eclipse, you can also start with an empty project and copy/paste all sources from CubeMX, but there are a lot of details that you have to configure manually.

I don't know, it is not on my top priority list, it might take a few months to get to it.

and it'll probably be OpenSTM32 import, i.e. you need to configure CubeMX to generate the OpenSTM32 project, then ask GNU ARM Eclipse to import it.

Carmine's plugin anyway is much more mature I think.

BTW Liviu I used a trick to be able to remove or update include/libraries etc...
I added an attribute to listOptionValue to know which library added what.
I don't know anything about eclipse internals... so that may be a bad idea in general... but maybe not.
If it makes any sense would you add such a marker to the include paths, define etc... that your plugin is adding?
Do you have a better idea?
Do you know any way from python to generate an id for <option />?

The other option is to compare all the content to what a library added and delete just the stuff that match. I'll consider to write an ""uninstall"" file then.

I have successfully installed packages for STM32F030 devices and noted that the SVD files were processed. Producing the following in the log.

Parsing SVD file "".../Packages/Keil/STM32F0xx_DFP/1.4.0/SVD/STM32F030.svd""...

When I install the NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.2.0.pack it does not load the nrf51.svd file and the result is that the devices are not available for selection in the Project Properties Device Selection.

I looked through the working pdsc files for STM devices and I noted that STM SVDs are under ""subfamily"" nodes while the Nordic SVDs are under a  ""family"" XML node.

Are the Nordic files broken in some way?

The STM32F103RB settings are remnants from the ST Micro devices loaded previously.

Because I was only doing one file I noticed an error in the console complaining about a missing pdsc. Package/.cache contains (amongst others)

but no NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.2.0.pdsc. I copied/renamed the file into the .cache directory and restarted Eclipse and the Settings->Devices now contains the expected entries!

I am not sure where the 8.0.3.pdsc file came from. I didn't select it.

It is working for me now. Thanks for the plugins and the Saturday support, brilliant.

I installed the 8.2.0 version. When I go to the Settings -> Devices no devices are available. Again copying the NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.2.0.pdsc into the cache ""fixes"" it.

I have attached the GNU Arm Eclipse Packs console log.

I tried one more thing, removed Packages, and instead selected the older 8.0.3 DeviceFamily entry and it works fine. nRF51 Devices appear in the Settings.

I think such a request makes sense, and will allow users to exchange ideas and help each other (hopefully also reducing the number of tickets registered here).

Since my experience with forums is relatively small, I would like to suggest a solution, and you to comment on it.

Up to now I evaluated three solutions, and the one that has the best profi look is:
- http://www.element14.com/community/groups/gnu-arm-eclipse

It is based on jive, and looks identical to the one used by the ARM Community site. **GNU ARM Eclipse** is a complex group, with Blog, Discussions, Documents and many more.

Access is currently open to everyone and non-members can view content.

Previous experiments include:
- http://gnuarmeclipse.forumotion.net, a phpBB forum, with a common look, not particularly attractive to my opinion;
- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gnu-arm-eclipse-users, a Google discussion group, too simple for my taste.

If there are no better ideas, I suggest to make the Element14 group the public discussion forum for GNU ARM Eclipse.

What do you think?

I suggest you use the 4.9.3 version, available from launchpad. (had no time to test the recent 5.2).

so update the toolchain, update the plug-ins and qemu, then do **exactly** the steps in the arm blinky tutorial, using the stm32f4discovery board, and it should work.

once you confirm that your environment is ok, experiment with other boards and configurations.

did Nordic provide now freely all libraries? because I know of another Nordic plug-in, but is requires to separately install the non-public libraries.

regarding your question, I'm currently working on a solution to migrate the existing templates to packages, so, from my point of view, the templates are dead, I will no longer invest any efforts in maintaining them once the new packs based wizard will be operational.

but this might take a few more months, so if you are in a hurry, and the template is already functional, you can use it.

maven is complicated, probably for a single plug-in you can do the builds with Eclipse.

I don't know.  I haven't reached the point where I was worrying about that yet.  It doesn't seem like I need to log in to download the SDK anymore and I see some BSD-like licenses on things.

> I know of another Nordic plug-in

The one I found got abandoned by the author and no longer works with the latest Eclipse/ARM stuff.  The author also never provided source code to allow others to compile it.  If you know of one that is better than that, I'm all ears.

> but this might take a few more months, so if you are in a hurry

Not in a hurry, but there has been very little progress over the past year at making the Nordic chips work better with Eclipse from the Nordic side (ie. actually making managed build work--Makefile build somewhat defeats the point of using Eclipse).  I suspect it's simply that Nordic doesn't have the resources to support anything other than Keil directly.  If there is progress, then I can swallow hard and justify jumping through hoops to my managers until the new stuff hits.  

I do see from this issue:
https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/45

that you are apparently able to at least somewhat read the ""pack"" that Nordic itself prepares for Keil.  Obviously, me helping to debug this would be a far more ideal solution than me bumbling around all by myself.  Embedded stuff already suffers from too little manpower; I'd much prefer to throw in with what the important people are already doing and help out.

Thanks for taking the time to reply.

yes, my Packs Manager reads all Keil packs.

the plan for the future wizard is to create empty CMSIS projects for all processors having a CMSIS pack, so Nordic should be covered. 

for anything more than an empty project... it is hard to tell, since generally the Keil packs provide little support for GCC.

I followed all the instructions on installing the prerequisites (windows build tools, toolchain, qemu) and the plug-in. Everything seemed to install fine, and I made sure not to include anything in the PATH env. I double-checked by trying to run make in a command line, which correctly didn't find the program.

I created the tutorial blinky project, hit Build, and got this error:

`Cannot run program ""make"" (in directory ""F:\Users\rober\workspace\blinky\Debug""): CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified`

I checked the Global Tools Paths in preferences, they seem ok:

The PATH doesn't seem to be overridden, since I checked the Project Preferences > C/C++ Build > Environment settings, and the build tools bin directory is definitely in the PATH.

![path](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1783950/12375341/c8675aaa-bc72-11e5-8ce5-24cd66c23b70.png)

I also opened a Windows command prompt, and did this:

```
F:
cd Users\rober\workspace\blinky\Debug
PATH=(I copied the PATH from the Project Preferences)
make all
```

And it worked fine -- I ended up with blinky.elf and blinky.hex. So somehow Eclipse isn't doing something right, but I can't figure out what.

This has been a long standing problem for me so I purchased a Segger J-Link-Pro debugger. (as you suggested) The original thought was that this was an OpenOCD issue.

The debug output is much faster with the Segger but it is still killing interrupts and causing the application to fail. I am running under FreeRTOS so I tried to create an Idle task to output a single character at a time by modifying _write(). Unfortunately this is not used with SEMIHOSTING.

How can I fix this problem?

what do you mean? by definition using semihosting makes the application non real time, since the processor is halted during calls to the debugger.

> How can I fix this problem?

do not use semihosting. create a new test project, be sure you do not select semihosting syscalls, and for trace select ITM (not available on smaller cores). you then need to configure J-Link to use SWD, and compute the SWO frequency as a divisor of your system clock.

trace_printf() uses trace_write() as implementation, not _write().

I saw some differences in how paths were specified in the templates[1] and found the same differences in the project and was too quick to think it was a problem in the template.
Apparently at a certain point eclipse decided to convert some relative path to absolute.
Something I would remember if I did it since include path are ""too many"" to change them inadvertently.

BTW I'm trying to write a CubeMX -> GNU ARM plugin importer or possibly, more generally a library importer/rebaser for GNU ARM plugin. Unfortunately my Java-fu is too weak to do it directly in eclipse.

I had difficulties with getting any ""packs"" installed. Clicking the refresh button in the Packs perspective would start downloading stuff, but in the end no packs would show up (after the process completed after a couple of minutes). There were errors about missing/broken URLs on the console (eclipse stdout/stderr).

Even though some links were broken, not all were. In the end I succeeded installing some packs by manually downloading http://www.keil.com/pack/index.idx (the default packs URL), removing everything I knew I didn't need and editing Preferences -> Packages so that I have just a local repository with URL file:///path/to/my/index.idx file. Then going back to the Packs perspective, press the refresh button, a list of packs would show up and I could install them.

I have a theory that one or more broken downloads causes the gnuarmeclipse packs manager downloader to give up on the working downloads too. That should be improved. I think it should show the packages it managed to download, even if some failed.

EDIT: Add missing step in getting the manually edited .idx file into Eclipse.

wrong, the Eclipse version might have its share for the blame, but if you want to stay away from trouble, you should use the latest versions (Eclipse + plug-ins). if your distribution package manager was not able to install a functional Eclipse Mars.1 with all required plug-ins, it is a good indication that you should install Eclipse manually, as suggested.

also I could not identify any plug-in released in Jan 19, 2015; v2.11.1 was released in Dec. 2015. are you sure you initially used the latest version of the plug-ins?

install Eclipse and the plug-ins **exactly** as described in the docs and it should work.

For instance i have some ""old"" 3.4x86-32 linux and 10.6.8 mac that cannot (easily) have java upgrade hence will not run latest eclipse (anything after kepler SR2 actually). 
I think the big c/c++ dev part of the plugin still work on this system but at some point it could brake :( mean i will get stuck with my old version or coudl heven brake it trying to upgrade.

I will not push toward keeping old suff compatibility i know how painful it is  but keeping some consideration for it will be welcome

I guess that if you repeat these steps, you will reach the same conclusion on your Linux too.

It was a user mistake.

What I did was installing the latest gnuarmeclipse plugin (v2.11.1) using ""offline method"", by extracting the zip file into the ""dropins"" folder (all automated). But I also had, unknowingly, an old install of the plugin in ~/.eclipse, from when I used the ""update site"" method (probably a year ago or so). And apparently the plugin in ~/.eclipse takes precedence over ""dropins"". So there I was thinking I was running v2.11.1 when I really was not.

And here is why I reported conflicting plugin version and timestamp at the top. For some reason (possibly to verify the install?), instead of just using the timestamp in the zip file (filename) that I had downloaded, I went into Eclipse to view installation details. And there was the timestamp from the _old_ plugin. And I didn't notice :-(

Maybe that is a misunderstanding? I didn't dig deep.

Anyway, assuming the ""only latest version"" install... That is often what you want, but not _always_. Maybe you want to setup an environment for an old project (and you don't want to ""port"" it to the newest version yet)? Maybe you want to work on two different projects on one PC, and those projects require different plugins / Eclipses?

Using a package manager / automation tool solves these issues for me. How do you solve such issues?

For each project I have a folder with:
- a folder with one or more Eclipses (all installed from original eclipse.org archives)
- a folder with one or many Eclipse workspaces, 
- multiple folders with git repositories.

As for installing different plug-ins, I download the archives and then use them as source for **Install New Software...** (you can enter an url, a folder or an archive)

I keep bumping into the same problem over and over again when trying to build projects for the [Ublox C027](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/u-blox-C027/) with a Cortex M3 NXP LPC1768 CPU.

My development platform:
- Windows 7 x64
- Eclipse Luna 4.4.2 with your (otherwise very helpful) up-to-date GNU ARM Eclipse plugins
- GNU ARM Eclipse build tools 2.6-201507152002
- GNU Tools ARM Embedded 5.2 2015q4

To simplify reproducing the problem, I have attached the required [Eclipse projects](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/files/106533/guarndt_c027_mqtt.zip) except for the [mbed library](https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed) built as described [here](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/SDK-Development/wiki/Mbed-SDK-build-script-introduction); it should be added to the workspace as a project named `mbed' for the references in the given projects to match.

When trying to build the project C027_MQTT, I get the following error message:

I can work around this issue by using a manually edited Makefile similar to [this one](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/files/106548/Makefile.txt) based on that provided with projects exported from the mbed online compiler, but I would prefer to do it the Eclipse way, as in the given projects.

There have been reports of similar problems, for instance [in your project](http://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/support-requests/30/) and on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22660011/undefined-reference-to-kill-getpid-and-sbrk). Those did not seem helpful to me, as they often suggest workarounds in code, which are obviously not required: with a common Makefile, it works, so it is probably just a configuration issue in the project, maybe library inclusion order or something? I've switched many options in Eclipse's project config, like newlib-nano, which did not really change anything.

It would be great to hear if you can help here. Honestly, I'm not even sure if this is a bug or a configuration issue...

The screenshot shows that I added libc and libstd++ twice, which makes it work.
I know that the order of inclusion matters, but I do not understand how adding them _first_ helps, as they should not introduce new dependencies?

first, this is method is not supported, and I did not try it myself, so you're on thin ice.

what might probably work, is to install a local web site, including an index.idx as the one used on the keil site, and point the packs manager to it.

there is a post in the project forum on how to add a new packs site, maybe it can help too.

GNU ARM C/C++ J-Link Debugging  3.2.1.201512141335
Java 8 update 71
Windows 10 Pro
I tried GCC 4.9,3 and 5.3
I tried Segger j-link install 5.00l and 5.1

**Steps to repeat**
1. open j-link GDB server for both targets.
2. open single eclipse instance and start debugging ProjectA and ProjectB
3. open ProjectB source file and disable or enable a breakpoint

I expect only ProjectB target to be halted and breakpoint set.  However, ProjectA is also halted (even though no breakpoint is set).  

Segger logs for ProjectB are as expected:

> _Debugger requested to halt target...
> ...Target halted (PC = 0x00012BD2)
> Reading all registers
> Read 4 bytes @ address 0x00012BD2 (Data = 0x0380F3C3)
> Removing breakpoint @ address 0x000129EE, Size = 2
> Starting target CPU..._

Segger logs for ProjectA should be empty but show:

> _Debugger requested to halt target...
> ...Target halted (PC = 0x0000D16C)
> Reading all registers
> Read 4 bytes @ address 0x0000D16C (Data = 0x00000000)

what you said though:

1  I can actually set breakpoints for both projects and they all
work correctly.  They are set only in the appropriate target. 
2. If this were a CDT problem wouldn't the breakpoint get set in
both j-link logs?  It is only being set in the correct target.
3. So you see, breakpoints are actually working perfectly with
multiple projects EXCEPT for this stopping of all targets while
breakpoints are being set.  Of course this could still be a CDT
problem.

I would love to narrow this issue down more so if you can point me
to any CDT bug/feature reports or relevant documentation maybe I can
contribute to getting this resolved in the CDT...

let me try to repeat to see if I got your report right:
- you have two j-link probes connected to the same machine (with both different serial numbers), accessed via two gdb servers (waiting on different ports) 
- you start two debug sessions on the same Eclipse, using the GNU ARM Eclipse J-Link plug-in
- you set a breakpoint in one target
- you start execution of both targets
- when one target reaches the breakpoint, the other target halts too

additional questions:
- do both targets run the same application?
- if not, when you set the breakpoint in one target, does a file with the same name exist in the other target? is so, could you set a breakpoint in a file that does not exist in the other target?

please be sure you erase all breakpoints from both targets before setting the breakpoint in one target.

the j-link plug-in uses the gdb hardware plug-in, and does not change much in the actual debug sequences, it mostly starts the gdb server, the gdb client and various consoles.

I do not exclude a problem in the j-link plug-in, if cdt debug worked fine, the problem must be either in the j-link or in the hw debug plug-in.

could you try to use the h/w plug-in directly, without the j-link plug-in. if this works, the problem should be in my plug-in.

> I would love to narrow this issue down

please do and let me know the results.

1. Yes, I do have 2 probes and 2 gdb servers on different ports.
2. Yes, I start 2 debug sessions on the same Eclipse using gnu arm j-link plug-in
3. No, I can set breakpoints on any target before or during execution and they all work correctly in the sense that the breakpoint is set in the correct target and each target only breaks on the breakpoints that belong to that target.  So all breakpoints work as expected.

The problem is as follows:
1. I start debugging both targets
2. I create a breakpoint for TargetB
3. The j-link log for TargetB shows that the CPU is stopped, registers are read, the breakpoint is set, and the CPU continues execution.  This is correct.
4. The problem is that the j-link log for TargetA also shows that the CPU is briefly stopped, registers are read, and the CPU continues execution.  This is incorrect.  The TargetA j-link log should not see any activity when I add a TargetB breakpoint.

The problem is that TargetA's algorithms are VERY sensitive to timing jitter and these constant stop-read_register-go sequences are causing problem.

In answer to your additional questions:
1.  no they are running different applications
2. no, files names are mutually exclusive since that would cause all kinds of problems.

good, things might have improved with Mars, but in previous versions even debugging two applications in sequence sometimes messed breakpoints.

yes, from your report it looks like a reentrancy problem in the plug-in. time permitting, I'll take a look, but can't promise a fix soon.

until then, as a safer workaround, you can split your workspace in two, one for each project, and use two different Eclipses.

hmmm.... it was not intended to be used like this, to install multiple packages you can multiple select them and click Install; in the mean time you can do anything you want, except install other packages.

the Packs Manager will suffer a major rewrite soon, so I'll probably change this behaviour too.

we have an enhancement request for your OpenOCD and PEMicro features. The problem is, they are not supported on MacOSx, but we have them on our KDS updates site for Linux and Win, so when you try the ""Install New Software"" they show up and can be installed. Could you please add OS dependency on Linux and Win under the ""Supported Environments"" in those feature? It would prevent users from accidentally installing them. I guess this is reproducible on any Eclipse/Java/Mac/plug-ins versions. Thank you.

> sources files should be on GitHub, but not the packages (zip files)

GitHub provides a great experience, everything is Git and everything is markdown. 

you can publish binary files in the project git, but even more appropriate is to use the project web (or GitHub Pages, as it is named). it is also stored as Git (a distinct branch or a separate repo), so the entire project is somehow limited (1 GB, if I remember right). the Pages site is available from a separate server, with a distinct url, ending in `github.io`.

on the other side SourceForge provides a distinct download solution, somehow more appropriate for high volume downloads, with multiple mirrors in different location. however, if you need a nice url, you also need to configure some web pages in the project web, and make them redirect pages (this is how I did it with the GNU ARM Eclipse update site).

> does it work?

well, SourceForge ""generally"" works, but it had some problems, sometimes the mirror servers take some time to update, sometimes the entire SourceForge is in read-only mode, etc.

personally I would like to get rid of SourceForge, and I think I know how to migrate everything to GitHub, (which, up to now, performed impeccably), but GitHub has a major disadvantage, it does not provide download statistics, which, for my needs, is very annoying.

I'm trying now things with a GitHub site (https://github.com/ErichStyger/McuOnEclipse_CMSIS-PACKS).
I tried as well the site on https://github.com/in4lio/mdr1986x-pack-repo. 
While there is no error, no packs are shown in the Eclipse UI (for both sites).
Is this normal? I don't think so?

I currently have a working GNU ARM Eclipse project and I would like to be able to export it so that it is independent of GNU ARM Eclipse, but still builds using a simple make call.

Is there a way of doing this?
How does eclipse internally invoke make?

The implementation invokes the pyOCD gdbserver to determine what boards and processors (""targets"") it supports and makes those choices available in the Debugger tab. However, if first populates the processor combobox with a static default list. That's misleading and ultimately can do more harm than good.

E.g., if you have two launch configurations that each point to a different pyOCD gdbserver, and each of these reports different targets and boards, the same, single collection of targets and boards can end up being shown in both launch configurations. This happens when you have the launch configs open to the Debugger tab and you switch back and forth between the two launch configs. In that case, ILaunchConfigurationTab.activated() is not called by Eclipse as you go back and forth, and so the current implementation ends up using a single context (which is correct only half the time).

First, thanks for this great plug-in! It has made it much easier to integrate J-link debugging in Eclipse as well as improving integration with arm-none-eabi. 

Only problem I have is that if I install device family pack version 8.3.2 or later the device selection become empty in the project settings. Comparing the 8.3.1 against 8.3.2 the only noticeable difference I could find was that 'date' was added to the release version on all the following releases that didn't work:

```
 <release version=""8.3.2"" date=""2015-12-16"">
Date: 16.12.2015 Updated release version to adapt to MDK version.
</release>
<release version=""8.3.1"">
Date: 13.11.2015 Updated release version to adapt to MDK version.
</release>
```

Also, from the packs log I can  see that it tries to parse  NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.5.0.pdsc, which doesn't exist:

> Parsing cached PDSC file ""C:\Eclipse_tutorial\eclipse-cpp-mars-1-win32-x86_64\eclipse\Packages.cache\NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.5.0.pdsc""...
> Error: C:\Eclipse_tutorial\eclipse-cpp-mars-1-win32-x86_64\eclipse\Packages.cache\NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.5.0.pdsc (The system cannot find the file specified), file: NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.5.0.pdsc

Instead it should look for [nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.pdsc](http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/pieces/nRF_DeviceFamilyPack/NordicSemiconductor.nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.pdsc) I think. Manually renaming nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.pdsc to nRF_DeviceFamilyPack.8.5.0.pdsc and adding it to the .cache directory does solve the problem though. 

Thanks,

no, I want to say that adding a program to your user shell path does not guarantee to be found in a gui application. I don't know on windows, but for some unix boxes (my mac and several linux distros I tried) you need to set a separate path for gui applications (a separate file).

to avoid such odd behaviours (and support tickets), my plug-ins require an explicit path to each tool.

yes, but in a different environment

> From my experience, that program should work the same as if the program is invoked from a shell (assuming both the shell and the GUI app have the same environment variables)

they don't. 

if you change the PATH in, let's say $HOME/.bashrc, this will be visible only for terminal shell sessions, the GUI may but usually may not use this file.

you need to change the PATH in some system wide location, specific to each platform.

> A specific problem example 

on OS X, setting a custom PATH for all graphical applications is possible by adding a PATH entry in $HOME/.MacOSX/environment.plist. by default this file is not present and needs to be created.

different linux distros may have totally different locations for this.

> will you reject a pull request that provides the behavior requested here? 

go ahead and prepare an Eclipse patch to change the system GUI behaviour on all platforms(!), and I'll consider it.

developer_ has to contend with. I'm not saying your plugins should make
using PATH-based tools easy or reliable. I'm saying your plugins shouldn't
make it impossible. Right now, the pyOCD plugin makes it impossible. If the
string in the gdbserver field doesn't resolve to an absolute file path that
exists, then the code doesn't accept it. My fix is simple and has no
OS-specific code in it. It will work equally well for any OS. All it does
is give the user the _possibility_ for things to work if he has gdbserver
in PATH and he specifies the exe by simple name. If it works for him,
great. If it doesn't, oh well--he'll need to specify a full path
(explicitly or via substitution variables). I'll create the pull request
and we'll see what you think

however the main problem is to detect if the file is available or not, getting the size is a bonus.

the CMSIS Packs design has a small flaw, the index does not refer to all existing versions, i.e. it is not possible to tell which versions are available. the index only refers to a pdsc file (the version inside the index is also not reliable, the pdsc file may be newer than the index); the pdsc file then lists several versions, but not all of them are available, so the only way to tell is to iterate them. 

as you noticed, this approach is expensive, and a lazy access would be a better solution.

I am not able to make working software breakpoints with J-Link probe. 
- The following code works with GDB and OpenOCD with a St-Link V2 probe (SWD).

``` c
void __attribute__((noreturn)) __assert_func(const char *file, int line, const char *func, const char *failedexpr) {
  asm volatile(""bkpt"");
  abort();
}
```
- The following code works with a Segger J-Link Lite probe and Keil uVision 5:

``` c
__asm void break_here(void)
{
    bkpt #0x01
    mov pc, lr  
}
```
- Unfortunately, the same code does not work with the GNU ARM C/C++ J-Link Debugging plugin in Eclipse. I get the following error, but the processor does not stop:

```
Read 4 bytes @ address 0x00023544 (Data = 0x46F7BE01)
Starting target CPU...
Read 4 bytes @ address 0x00023544 (Data = 0x46F7BE01)
Starting target CPU...
```

I use the following software versions :
- Eclipse Luna Service Release 2 (4.4.2)
- GNU ARM C/C++ J-Link Debugging version: 3.2.1.201511061603
- Latest available Segger version V5.12

I also tested the same project using Eclipse Mars 2 and GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins v2.11.3.

Based on the tests I made, I think the problem comes from the plugin, or a wrong configuration of it. Are the software breakpoints supported with the J-Link Debugging plugin ?

Any help is welcome.

The plug-in starts the j-link gdb server with some default options, but does not prevent you to add your own specific options if you want to enable other functionality.

And I have serious doubts that the plug-in can prevent gdb to stop at a breakpoint, if the hardware encounters one.

The plug-in is just a wrapper, you can start the gdb server with the options of your choice and also start the gdb client manually, with the options of your choice, to test if the software breakpoints are functional or not.

@metc, why do you need a custom configuration?

J-Link defaults are fine for most cases, only when you debug in RAM, or debug larger A cores, you need to set custom configurations, but in this case you need to know very well what you are doing.

I come back to you after a long time. I made several tests, and the software breakpoint works with the Segger tools version `5.10m`, but it doesn't with the latest version.

This is my setup:

- Firmware: J-Link Lite-Cortex-M V8
- GNU ARM C/C++ J-Link Debugging version `3.2.1.201604190915`

GDB 7.10 changed something in the way breakpoints halt execution, and current SEGGER JLinkGDBServer had problems to correctly inform GDB about the BKPT.

I provided SEGGER all details and they promised a fix with the next release.

as a temporary workaround, you can use GDB 7.8, it properly halts at breakpoints with the current SEGGER GDB server.

Thanks for your reply and the investigation. Really appreciated.
I also posted an issue on the Segger forum: http://forum.segger.com/index.php?page=Thread&postID=11183&highlight=breakpoint#post11183

So I will test it again when the next stable release from Segger is available.

ERROR_JOIN_TO_JOIN
138 (0x8A)
The system tried to join a drive to a directory on a joined drive.

This error seems to crop up when the debug component sitting between GDB and the target (e.g. OpenOCD, J-Link GDB Server etc.) is misconfigured or - as above - simply not told to run.

Judging by this:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29747304/how-to-troubleshoot-an-error-138-error-join-to-join

the error may actually be coming from GDB and not any Eclipse component?

The error certainly doesn't make obvious sense in this context but perhaps some of this info will help to track down why it happens whatever about addressing it - especially if it's ultimately a GDB issue?

Hope this helps.

I don't know of ubuntu 16, but most other linux distros required to manually configure some environment variable to use GTK2 instead of GTK3 for Eclipse to work properly. google it for more details.

instead of using Neon beta, perhaps a Mars 2 with this fix would be more stable.

the problem is due to a dependency to a deprecated plug-in (org.eclipse.cdt.debug.mi.core).

the solution is to rewrite the debugging plug-ins to avoid using the deprecated plug-in. 

I do not know yet how complicated this will be. time permitting, I'll give it a try next week.

The version of Eclipse I have is a clean new one. It has CDT 9.10.201609121658 and the Eclipse core 4.6.1.20161007-1200. As mentionned before this is an offline installation. Was the solution to this issue involving other dependencies than the one already in CDT ?

This issue applies to Executable projects which have the CDT property ""Generate Makefiles automatically"" checked.

When modifying source files and doing a build an existing binary file will be re-linked. This is the normal behaviour. However, modifications to the linker script(s) do not cause a re-link. You have to do a clean and then build to get a new binary file.

This feature request is to consider adding linker script dependencies into the generated makefiles.

Generally the makefile has the following dependency for elf files:

hello.elf: $(OBJS) $(USER_OBJS)
The OBJS variable is created by the subdir.mk files for each of the source directories which are all included by the main makefile (they each append the list of object files in that directory).

The USER_OBJS variable is defined in the top-level objects.mk file (based on the ""Other objects"" field in the linker settings in project properties).

Various other variables are defined in the top-level makefile. So this could define a variable with the linker script (or scripts) and add it to the dependency line. For example:

LINKER_SCRIPTS := ../cmsis/MK64FN1M0VDC12.ld
...
hello.elf: $(OBJS) $(USER_OBJS) $(LINKER_SCRIPTS)

One workaround for this is to create a file in the top-level project directory called makefile.defs (this is included in the makefile, if present) defining the required linker script dependency, for example:

hello.elf: ../cmsis/MK64FN1M0VDC12.ld

agree.

but how do you suggest to implement it? the last time when I checked, the CDT classes used to generate the makefiles were not derivable, and copying them with all dependencies in the plug-ins is not a solution.

Looks like you could override org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.makegen.gnu.GnuMakefileGenerator.

Or perhaps there's something useful in:

  org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.makegen.gnu.GnuMakefileGenerator.addRuleForSource(String, StringBuffer, IResource, IPath, IResourceInfo, boolean, Vector<IPath>, Vector<IPath>)

My project uses the external builder. However, building a single file (editor context menu, ""Build selected file(s)"") invokes the internal builder. If list file generation is activated, the command line passed to the compiler will contain the option -Wa,-adhlns=$@.lst. This works with the external builder, because make resolves $@ to the current object file's name (with correct relative path to the configuration's build directory). For a single file, this resolution does not work, so the compiler will output a file $@.lst in the configuration's build directory. 

This is quite confusing, because list files from the last full build may still exist, and you may find yourself looking at an old file, wondering why it doesn't contain your latest changes.

I found a workaround after searching, which modifies the keil.index.idx file and creates a local repository, but I am not able to reenact this based on the description. I tried to create a local repository at Preferences->packages, but doesn't work.

The global and workspace settings (Preferences > C/C++ > Build > Global Tools Paths and Workspace Tools Paths) can accept eclipse variables*; eg ${eclipse_home}bin.

This is not the case for the project settings (Project properties > C/C++ Build > Tools Paths). When an eclipse variable is entered into either the ""Build tools folder"" or the ""Toolchain folder"" the OK and Apply buttons are disabled and the message ""Value must be an existing directory"" is displayed at the top of the dialog.

*: the ability to accept eclipse variables in paths, or a currently non-existent path is provided by the following defaults:
  http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/developer/preferences/ilg.gnuarmeclipse.managedbuild.cross/#defaults
### Steps to Reproduce
1. In a C Executable Project with toolchain set to Cross ARM GCC open project properties  > C/C++ Build > Tools Paths
2. In ""Build tools folder"" or ""Toolchain folder"" field enter a path containing an eclipse variable (eg ${eclipse_home}bin) and Click OK.
   Actual: properties dialog is not dismissed. Instead the OK and Apply buttons become greyed out.
   Expected: properties dialog is dismissed and value is set.
3. Click in the ""Build tools folder"" or ""Toolchain folder"" field again.
   Actual: Page message area displays error marker and  text ""Value must be an existing directory"".
   Expected: not error message.

However, setting the above defaults to true does not enable the folder check; non existent folders can be set.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create and launch an Eclipse product with a preferenceCustomization file (eg: ""plugin_customization.ini"") using extension point org.eclipse.core.runtime.products containing the following values:
   
   ilg.gnuarmeclipse.managedbuild.cross/global.toolchain.path.strict=true

4. Click in the ""Build tools folder"" or ""Toolchain folder"" field again.
   Actual: Page message area displays no error message.
   Expected: Page message area displays error marker and  text ""Value must be an existing directory"".

The same happens with Preferences > C/C++ > Build > Workspace Tools Paths

I would like to congratulate you for developing and maintaining this plug-in. It's a big help for hobbyists worldwide.

I have an improvement suggestion related to Peripherals view. As not all silicon vendors publish CMSIS packs it would be nice to be able to load one or more SVD files (describing the core registers and the peripherals registers) even there is no device selected in C/C++ Build->Settings->Devices.

I'm willing to test this feature if you decide to implement it.

Kind regards,
Taz

I would like to know if its' possible to not regenerate all the makefile everytime ? When a project have a 10 folder it's not that bad, but in our case we build a project with more than 500 file in 100 folder. Only to generate makefiles, this take 30 to 45 second. 

Probably trigger the generation of the makefile only on file added/removed/excluded from build/change project setting should be the way to go. 

Regards

Jonathan

looking closely to your error message, it seems you have a SSL problem with your Java.

I suggest you google for the error message, perhaps you find a way to fix it. 

the repository is ok, I just tried it a few minutes ago. if you have a separate machine, or preferably a fresh virtual machine, it'll probably work.

Here are my findings:
1. It didn't matter what type of update mechanism I tried (Marketplace, update site, etc.), neither worked.
2. Googling the error message didn't lead to something. All results were mentioning that the server uses a self certification, totally out of my knowledge and als out my influence.
3. Trying a virtual machine (Linux Mint, Lubuntu): Showed the same error!
4. Trying it on a different hardware (Laptop, also Win10 pro 64bit): It worked! So something must be wrong with my machine.
5. Totally removing and reinstalling JAVA didnt't change anything.
6. Disabling Antivirus (Kaspersky Internet Security 2016) also didn't change anything.
7. BUT: Totally Removing AV solved the problem!

I deinstalled Kaspersky and switched to Bitdefender and things are still working.
So it seems, the problem was related to Kaspersky Antivirus together with the self certification of the server.
I use Kaspersky for nearly a year and never had this problem. I don't really know what changed.
Strange also, other plugins (bracketeer, plantuml, etc. ) and also the main eclipse site always worked. The problem only occured with gnuarmeclipse.

I forgot to mention:
The other hardware (Laptop) also runs Kaspersky (same version),  but there are no problems.
So maybe the problem disappeared due to another reason.

I hope my findings will be helpfull for others.
Maybe there is a chance to find the real cause of this.

the gnuarmeclipse update site does not make use of any security features at all, it is a plain folder on one of sourceforge servers. so please allow me to doubt that the problem has anything to do with gnuarmeclipse itself, I would suspect the sourceforge servers.

> Maybe there is a chance to find the real cause of this.

here is my theory: sourceforge uses some unusual certificates on their servers; Eclipse detects that something is wrong, and tries to check the certificates more thoroughly, but the AV blocks these packets and the install fails.

> I use Kaspersky for nearly a year and never had this problem.

I never ever had any antivirus on my mac, and never had any problems, neither with viruses nor blocked ports.

---

Using **CMake** based projects with this plugin **_works_** fine out-of-the-box for **_building_**, but **_debugging_** (eg. on HW with openocd or QEMU) **_wont work_**. Executing a debug / run configuration will crash openocd / qemu.

Since all settings like Toolchain, Flags etc. are set by Cmake, Eclipse doesn't have tool settings available (#5).

---
## Here's how to setup a (working) CMake Project
### Basic setup

As for all CMake projects used with Eclipse:
1. **Setup** a the Cmake Project as usual (for ARM you may use a toolchain file)
2. **Import** the project into Eclipse by creating a new Project from existing Makefile
3. If necessary change **_build directory_** in Eclipse (**`Project Settings -> C/C++ Build`**, edit _""Build directory""_)

You can now **_build_** the project.
### Fix Debugging

As stated above, compilation works – debugging not.
This happens because the settings as for default C/C++ projects aren't available. Therefore the Eclipse launch configurations will use the wrong (= default system) debugger instead of the ARM one. This will kill any execution on HW and QEMU.

GDB used by run configurations: `${cross_prefix}gdb${cross_suffix}`

Since both `cross_prefix` and `cross_suffix` aren't available for this project type, the GDB executable used will expand to just `gdb`.
#### Solutions
1. Manually **_change_** the **_GDB executable_** for each **_Debug / Run configuration_** to eg. `arm-none-eabi-gdb`
2. **OR:** Go to **`Project settings -> C/C++ Build -> Build Variables`** and add `cross_prefix` = `arm-none-eabi-`<sup>(Hint)</sup> (if necessary `cross_suffix` too) – this will expand the correct executable for _all_ launch configuration of that project

<sup>(Hint)</sup> _Don't forget the trailing '-'!_

* From a working CMake project, generate a ***Debug / Run Configuration*** and export it to a file such as ```debug.launch.in``` 
* Replace user-configurable information with CMake variable placeholders, e.g. ```@CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE@``` (more below)
* Use CMake command ```configure_file()``` to replace placeholders.

Currently, I found the following lines containing information that needs to be replaced as to make debugging work:

* ```<stringAttribute key=""org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.DEBUG_NAME"" value=""@CMAKE_DEBUGGER@""/>```
* ```<stringAttribute key=""org.eclipse.cdt.launch.PROJECT_ATTR"" value=""project-@CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE@@@CMAKE_BINARY_DIR_NAME@""/>```
* ```<listEntry value=""/project-@CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE@@@CMAKE_BINARY_DIR_NAME@""/>```

Some CMake variables are available, others must be constructed. In the end, I can provide a working debug configuration with the following lines:

```CMake
find_program(CMAKE_DEBUGGER NAMES arm-none-eabi-gdb${CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX})
get_filename_component(CMAKE_BINARY_DIR_NAME ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} NAME)
configure_file(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/eclipse/debug.launch.in ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/eclipse/$debug.launch @ONLY)

Normally the reset button works as expected. However, for one debug configuration that I set up it does not. This is a debug configuration with Initial reset and Pre-run/restart disabled as well as Load executable disabled. With this configuration I can start Eclipse/gdb/openocd with a running target connected without affecting the target. This much seems to work fine. However, after some normal debugging, if I try to reset the target using the reset toolbar button, the target just halts for a very short time and then continues running. This is verified by looking at the packets received by openocd when running with -d3 logging option. 

[Description of the bug or feature]
The behavior of the reset button with my debug configuration is:
Halt
Continue   <--- if configured to continue

**Expected behavior:**

The preferred behavior of the reset button with my debug configuration is:
Halt
Reset   <--- and don't run, stay at reset vector
Set temporary breakpoint   <--- if a temp breakpoint is configured
Continue.   <--- if continue is configured

Note: A work-around is to enter this into the gdb console (after halting the target):
mon reset halt
tbreak boot_card  <-- where I normally configure a temp bp after a reset
continue         <-- run to boot_card

Yes, that's what I observe (but can reset via gdb console work-around). However, if possible the ""Restart"" button behavior should be independent of the pre-run reset enable and always do a reset (then halt or run, optionally set a temp bp and optionally continue depending on other pre-run/Restart selections). Looking at the plug-in code, I have no idea if this is possible.
If not possible, then maybe if pre-run/Restart is disabled then the Restart button should be disabled or at least do nothing instead of halt then continue.

The issue has been solved , I am leaving this message here with the appropriate title so it can help others.
I spend some weeks on diagnosing why I was not able to have a bootloader (STM32 ) to execute some .bin file while I was able to execute the corresponding .elf file via Segger loader.
The pitfall is that objcopy with the option -j 'section-name' only includes the named section into the .bin file, no others. So while checking the boxes on .data and .text, you tell in fact to ignore other sections.

If you create however C++ code therer is a chance that you have a static initializer / constructor of a C++ class. These constructors get called in a section .init_array before start of the 'main' function.

So when the .init_array section is not copied to the image, probably a random pointer or 0 gets called, which stops further execution.
If you don't flag any of the .text and .data sections, then all necessary code gets copied into the .bin file.

Hope this helps somebody...

are the preprocessor unused sequences of code correctly greyed? this requires the indexer to know exactly the symbols defined inside each source file, and this is generally a challenge for non-managed projects.

The ""Main"", ""Source"" and ""Common"" tabs' contents can all be scrolled as expected.

### To Reproduce (always)
1) Open an eclipse installation containing the GNU ARM C/C++ J-Link Debugging feature.
2) Open Debug Configurations dialog (Run > Debug configurations ...).
3) Open an existing or create a new GDB SEGGER J-Link Debugging configuration.
4) Resize the dialog so that the contents of the Main tab are clipped (a vertical scroll bar may appear)
5) Click the Debugger tab and place the insertion point in the Executable field.
6) Use the mouse scroll wheel or track pad to scroll the contents:
  Actual: the contents are not scrolled
  Expected: the contents are scrolled (try scrolling in the Main tab to see expected behaviour)

The scrolling problem is caused by having a scrolled composite inside a scrolled composite. Inspected org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab2.createControl(), where the problem isn't present, and noticed it does not implement its own scrolled composite. This is because scrolling is implemented by the Platform in org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.LaunchConfigurationTabGroupViewer.showInstanceTabsFor().

The fix is to remove org.eclipse.swt.custom.ScrolledComposite from ilg.gnuarmeclipse.debug.gdbjtag.jlink.ui.TabDebugger.createControl() and ilg.gnuarmeclipse.debug.gdbjtag.jlink.ui.TabStartup.createControl().

Detailed description of the problem:
 
To populate the Settings -> Devices window with the list of available devices, the plug-in tried to load the PDSC file from the cache, instead of using the actual package folder. The cache stores only versions which were actual when Refresh commands were executed. Older versions were not cached. If multiple versions of a package were installed, and the most recent one was present in the cache, everything was ok. But if the most recent installed version was older, and was not present in the cache, the corresponding devices did not show up in the Devices windows.
 
Solution:
 
The correct behaviour is to load the PDSC files from the actual packages, not from the cache.

[Description of the bug or feature]
Under Windows, I can specify the following under the 'Other Options' to load the FreeRTOS Segger RTOS plugin:
-s -rtos GDBServer/RTOSPlugin_FreeRTOS

That works fine under Windows, and it finds the Segger plugin located in the GDBServer directory (inside the Segger installation).
The od thing is under Mac OS: here I have to specify the full path to the plugin, otherwise Segger does not find it:
-s -rtos/Applications/SEGGER/JLink_V610i/GDBServer/RTOSPlugin_FreeRTOS

Then it finds it:

I've noticed there's an increased demand for support of integrated solution to view trace data (typically that's ITM messages output via SWO and captured with stlink, jlink or an additional UART or LA).

Currently OpenOCD provides trace data by:
1. Capturing with stlink or jlink and writing to a file
2. Capturing with stlink or jlink and sending the stream via Tcl RPC
3. Configuring the target and letting other tools capture and process data (useful when SWO capture is done with an LA or additional UART)

The approach #1 is of limited usefullness on windows as this non-standard OS doesn't support named fifos (and its ""named pipes"" can not be manipulated like ordinary files).

I think many of your users would like to have trace output visible directly in one of Eclipse tabs during debugging.

For your consideration, here's a couple of related links:
1. https://github.com/apmorton/OpenOcdTraceUtil an external utility (written in C#) that communicates with OpenOCD via Tcl RPC, processes and displays trace data realtime
2. http://git.zapb.de/swodec.git/ and http://git.zapb.de/libswo.git/ libraries to facilitate trace data decoding
3. https://github.com/Getty/p5-itm Perl library to decode and pretty-print (to a colour text console) trace data
4. https://github.com/Linaro/OpenCSD a C++ library to do decoding, doesn't support ITM yet

FYI, the J-Link debugging plug-in has a separate tracing console (a separate tcp port), where the semihosting and SWO streams are  forwarded by SEGGER. 

in other words, decoding is done inside the J-Link GDB server.

if you want to help adoption, it would be useful to take a similar approach in OpenOCD too.

this solution works equally well for my Eclipse plug-ins and for any other debugger, and thus is preferred.

The Reset_Handler() in the ST-provided stm32l476xx.S assembly file is calling __libc_init_array, which causes the linker to throw the error ""undefined reference to _init"" when I try to build.  According to google the suggested fix is to remove the ""-nostartfiles"" linker option, but I see a lot of complaints about newlib-nano producing large C++ executables when it handles C++ startup/teardown.  Now I am wondering if I made the wrong choice, and should have stayed with the provided C startup code.

I'm using an stm32l476 discovery board, for which no template was available, so I used the generic Cortex-M template.  The README_DEVICE files say to remove the GNU ARM Eclipse startup C file and replace it with the vendor assembly file, but is this really the recommended option?

the C startup code was provided for good reasons. of course you can use any startup code you like, but you'll need to handle lots of newlib oddities.

the structure of the generated projects will soon change, when the new packet based wizards will be available. the new STM projects will also be integrated with CubeMX.

please take a look at the demo projects available from https://github.com/micro-os-plus/eclipse-demo-projects.

But you have confirmed what I suspected, that there has been a lot of work to optimize your startup code for newlib.  I very much doubt that ST's ""gcc"" port makes a similar effort, especially for C++ projects.  I have used the Cube software for pin planning and to spit out the basic required CMSIS files (register definitions), but in all other respects I try to avoid using any ST code because the quality is so poor.  I would like to try and use your startup code if I can.

I'll try a different approach this time, starting with your F7 demo project and then modifying it for the L4.  Peripherals are fairly similar between those two chips.

ah, ok, this does not recommend to use the assembly file, it is only a suggestion in case you really want to do it.

> I very much doubt that ST's ""gcc"" port makes a similar effort

it does not.

> I have used the Cube software for pin planning ...  I try to avoid using any ST code because the quality is so poor.

the ST code might not be great, but using Cube to generate the initialisation code should be fine.

actually I recommend keeping the Code in the loop, like I did in the demo projects, so you can easily update the initialisation if needed during development.

> starting with your F7 demo project and then modifying it for the L4

perhaps starting with the F0 project is more appropriate, since it also gets the HAL library from Cube.

I tried to create a simple blink led project template (no semihosting) -> I setup the correct GPIO etc -> I configured openOCD debug -> It starts, program + verify -> then It stucks at ""__DEBUG_BKPT();"" maybe for an Hard Fault Handler. 

I can not avoid it stops. I tried also to program with release configuration and program the hex from stlink but there are no GPIO changes. I checked that clock etc. are correct. I tried also to program a compiled hex which I have got from the past and It works perfectly so I think that It's a software problem maybe in the project template.

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/150,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/150,eclipse-plugins,192125920,150,Peripheral register addresses are ignoring addressOffset field from cluster in SVD files,TimothyVanRuitenbeek,1302418,Timothy Van Ruitenbeek,timothy@mindtribe.com,CLOSED,2016-11-28T21:47:18Z,2017-04-26T07:19:22Z,"### Description

The `addressOffset` value in `cluster` tags seems to be ignored when calculating register addresses.  Only the peripheral `baseAddress` and the register `addressOffset` are used.  See the [comment on line 21 of SvdClusterDMNode.java](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/blob/master/ilg.gnuarmeclipse.debug.gdbjtag/src/ilg/gnuarmeclipse/debug/gdbjtag/datamodel/SvdClusterDMNode.java#L21) for the intended behavior.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install plugin & Nordic Semiconductor nRF_DeviceFamilyPack
2. Set Project's device to `nRF52832_xxAA`
3. Debug the project and open the `PWM0` registers
4. Check the register address values for `SEQ` and `PSEL`

**Expected behavior:** 

`SEQ` should start at address 0x4001C520.
`SEQ->SEQ[0]` should start at address 0x4001C520.
`SEQ->SEQ[1]` should start at address 0x4001C540.
`PSEL` should start at address 0x4001C560.
`PSEL->OUT[0]` should start at address 0x4001C560.
`PSEL->OUT[1]` should start at address 0x4001C564.
`PSEL->OUT[2]` should start at address 0x4001C568.
`PSEL->OUT[3]` should start at address 0x4001C56C.

**Actual behavior:**

`SEQ` address is shown as 0x4001C000 (equal to the baseAddress).
`SEQ->SEQ[0]` starts at address 0x4001C000.
`SEQ->SEQ[1]` starts at address 0x4001C020.
`PSEL` address is shown as 0x4001C000 (equal to the baseAddress).
`PSEL->OUT[0]` starts at address 0x4001C000.
`PSEL->OUT[1]` starts at address 0x4001C004.
`PSEL->OUT[2]` starts at address 0x4001C008.
`PSEL->OUT[3]` starts at address 0x4001C00C.

Modifying the `addressOffset` value for the `OUT[]` register within the `PSEL` cluster from 0x000 to 0x560 (on line 27165 below) updates PSEL->OUT[] to show the correct addresses (and values), but `PSEL` still shows as address 0x4001C000.

Excerpt from `nrf52.svd`:

```

That's really strange I installed this plugin several times in the last years and I had no problems till now.

I have also tried it offline and online both ways, installed it and uninstalled it many times, did restarts of eclipse and my pc many times still i am getting same errors. I tried on other computers of the same network and it works but at my system its not working and my thesis work is stuck at this point. I have also disabled my antivirus and firewall still its not working. Dear @mgiaco can you please share what you did at your pc in steps so that i can try that at my end.

We are trying to add part of your plugin to the Arduino Eclipse plugin Named Sloeber to enable debugging on the zero. see https://github.com/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin/issues/603 for what we are trying to do.

I'm sorry to hit you again with this issue but my jenkins build server fails to access sourceforge as well.
Even though the travis build doesn't fail (and @wimjongman reports success) travis does report similar issues https://travis-ci.org/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin/builds/185471974#L247

you can do this, but for now there are not many changes, so it would be a waste. I suggest you follow the git, and when you think appropriate, you can run a new build. or we can configure a hook and you run the build on it.

fyi, I plan some repairs on the plug-ins after I fix qemu, probably in January.

I wanted to give you some feedback about the process.

I'm writing everything down at http://carlosdelfino.eti.br/III-SiConect.

I did all the installations in a VM, but I also left to the discretion of the institution the individual installation, which was difficult for the young people responsible for the infra university center, who did not dominate the tool do not know because, everything is very easy without a doubt.

But I realized that downloading CMSIS templates is a long process, and the most costly in time, it would be interesting to leave a hook to search for solutions related to this process to become fast.

To solve such a problem, I left a copy of the ""Packages"" directory on each machine so that it could be used, would there be a more efficient way for offline installation?

I noticed that even after the package was installed by copying only the folder, and updating, sometimes it was listed correctly in its eclipse perspective.

But other times when clicking the update button all packages disappear, and had to download again online, did not accept the package.

It would be interesting to have a way to download the templates only from the modules and microcontrollers used in Blink's example.

I leave the suggestion as a hook for a future improvement, so I mastered such an implementation I can verify this.

you mean CMSIS packs? yes, this is a design issue, they want the vendors to pack everything related to a device family in a single archive, and this results in huge files, that take a long time to download.

and also the CMSIS packs do not handle packs dependencies, in order to be able to split large packages in small pieces and use only what is needed.

I already addressed these issues, the xPacks are much smaller, and a dependency mechanism will automatically bring all needed small packages.

> clicking the update button all packages disappear

ouch! the Packs Manager had a bug, that was fixed, but I did not make the public release yet; the beta is available in updates-test, you should have used it.

> It would be interesting to have a way to download the templates only from the modules and microcontrollers used in Blink's example.

if you remember, the µOS++ demo and test projects use a `generate.sh` script, that brings only a few xPacks.

1. Install the pre-release plugin ( http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates-test) 
2. Press ""Update the package definitions from all repositories"" in C/C++ Packs perspective window


**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

nrF_DeviceFamily_Pack v8.11.0 is added to the list over available packs in the Packs Manager. 

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

After updating the packs definitions the latest nrF_DeviceFamily_Pack is v8.9.0.

Checking the CMSIS Pack Repository index file (http://www.keil.com/pack/index.idx) I see that the v8.11.0 pack is added, i.e. the following entry is in the list.

The issue happens after I updated from Eclipse 4.6.1 to Eclipse 4.6.2.
Moreover I have installed the last version of:
- GNU ARM Eclipse plugin
- GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD
- GNU ARM Eclipse Build Tool for windows
- GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain 5-2016-q3-update 

When I try to lunch debug session of type ""GDB OpenOCD Debugging"", the launch sequence is blocked at 99% (Launching: Configuring GDB) and the debugger never starts.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. I use a C++ program for a NUCLEO-F410 board created using the New Project wizard.
2. I create a standard Debug configuration 
3. I launch the debug configuration

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
I expect for the debugger to start.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
The launch sequence is blocked at 99% (Launching: Configuring GDB) and the debugger never starts.

Which version of CDT are you using with that?
Can I infer from this discussion that the problem appears to be not with neon.2 but with cdt9.2.0?

thank you for support. I confirm that the issue is solved after updating to the new version :).

How to reproduce:

1. Create a new project using File -> New -> C Project
2. In the ""C Project"" dialog, Choose ""Hello World ARM Cortex-M C/C++ Project"" and ""Cross ARM GCC"" Toolchain
3. Press Next
4. In the ""Target processor settings"" dialog, set ""Trace output"" to ""Semihosting DEBUG channel"". The other options in this dialog do not change the outcome.
5. Press Next
6. Press Next in the ""Folders"" dialog
7. In the ""Select Configurations"" dialog, either:
     - Click the ""Advanced settings..."" button to open the project properties dialog
     - Click the ""Finish"" button to create the project, then open project properties dialog via the Window menu
8. In the ""Properties for project_name"" dialog, choose C/C+ General -> Paths and Symbols
9. Click on the ""Symbols"" tab
10. Use the ""Configuration"" pull-down menu to switch the configuration to ""Release"" to see that the OS_USE_TRACE_SEMIHOSTING_DEBUG flag is set.

No peripherals displayed in Peripherals view while debugging an NXP LPC4350 (multicore: M4 and M0) even though the LPC4300 Series Device pack is installed and associated with the project.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Make sure LPC4300 Series Device pack is installed (v2.7.0 used).
2. Make sure LPC4350 Device is associated with the M4 code project (Project Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings).
3. Launch M4 debug session and verify it successfully connects to target and stops at main().
4. Select Peripherals view.

**Expected behavior:**
List of peripherals are displayed, or a way to select/expand peripherals in the view.

**Actual behavior:**
The Console view displays `Parsing SVD file ""/Users/kd/Documents/GNUARMEclipse/Packages/Keil/LPC4300_DFP/2.7.0""...` but often `Failed to get the peripheral descriptions` displays briefly in red at the bottom status line of the Console view.

i experience the same problem with LPC4300 and imx6 and imx7 packs. Maybe it helps as a hint, If i use the 2.6 Version of the LPC4300 Pack the parsing of the svd file works fine. With the 2.7 Version it stopped working.

regarding this topic again, i had a look into the IMX6_DFP pack from Keil. If i'm not wrong in the SVD folder there is one .svd file per core. Shouldn't it then be possible to parse the xml like for a single core ?

Hi @ilg-ul .

I'm studying the use of Freescale's MK22FN128VLH10 in small project, I saw that the GNU ARM Eclipse only has the KL family, is there any special procedure I can follow to use a layout for the MK22 family?

Or should I start with the KL family and make the file adjustments for the MK22?

- select the exectuable (valid .elf file), e.g. from another project

- Press Finish
- Press Debug

I have checked the created launch configuration settings, they are all fine and work in a 'normal' project. However, that project created with that Import menu has no tool chain assoziated. Could it be that it tries to access the CDT build system from the launch configuration code and it fails?
The .metatdata log did not show anything, so I'm not sure where the problem is (or if this is a general CDT problem).

@ErichStyger 
the code to import executables is not under the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins jurisdiction :-(

> However, that project created with that Import menu has no tool chain associated.

no surprise, since it needs no toolchain, it is already an executable.

> Could it be that it tries to access the CDT build system from the launch configuration code and it fails?
The .metatdata log did not show anything, so I'm not sure where the problem is (or if this is a general CDT problem).

starting with 4.2.1, both the gdb server executable and the gdb client fields are expanded and the results shown as Actual executable.

if the shown strings still contain macros, edit the fields and remove the macros, since they cannot be substituted.

special note on variables like `${openocd_path}/${openocd_executable}`, sincey they also depend on a project and cannot be substituted easily.

When editing a QEMU Debug Configuration (Debug Configurations -> GDB QEMU Debugging configuration), changing the Device name field of the Debugger tab does enable the apply button.

In order to save the modified Device name, you have to modify another field (say add and remove a character). You will then see the apply button as enabled.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Modify the Device name
1. Try to click apply

**Expected behavior:** 

The expected behavior would be to have the apply button enabled when you modify the Device name field. 

**Actual behavior:**

The apply button stays disabled (grayed out).

### Versions

* GNU ARM C/C++ QEMU Debugging version 3.1.2.201701141320
* Eclipse Version: Mars.1 Release (4.5.1)
* Java version 1.8.0_77
* Windows 10 x64
* Toolchain version 5.2 2015q4

I've got a problem when debugging a STM32F407 with the JLink plugin.
Downloading/starting the program and setting breakpoints works. The program stops at the breakpoints. Clicking on continue works.

However, clicking on the ""Pause"" icon in the debug window, while the target is running, has no effect on the target but results in a broken debugging session. 
The JLinkGDBServer's output shows nothing that indicates that a halt was requested

I also tested this with Eclipse Mars.2. It works properly. The GDB Server outputs the halt request and halts the target.

J-Link has a cool feature (https://www.segger.com/jlink-remoteserver.html). For this, I need to use 'ip tunnel:<serialno>' to connect to the tunneling server. The GNU ARM Eclipse J-Link Debug Plugin (Debugger > Connection > IP) allows to enter an ip address (e.g. 192.168.0.55 or localhost), but does not allow to enter a colon ':'. So I cannot specify a tunnel address.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go the the J-Link Debugger Launch configuration, 'Debugger' Tab
2. Select 'IP' as connection
3. try to enter
tunnel:609100567
as IP address

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
I can enter e.g. ""tunnel:609100567"" (colon accepted)
**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
Colon (:) is accepted.

**Workaround:
Interestingly, I can copy-paste tunnel:609100567 from the clip-board (at least on Windows), but I cannot type ':' in that edit box.

### Important notice

SourceForce recently updated the security certicates, making Eclipse install/upgrades fail with messages like this:

```
No repository found at http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates
```

The solution is to upgrade JDK to a version higher than 8u101.

For more details see [GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins sun.security.validator.ValidatorException](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/blog/2016/12/02/plugins-install-issue/).

### Prerequisites

In case you encounter problems while using the plug-ins, please consider the following:

* [ ] read the documentation pages carefully
* [ ] check the [Known issues](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/known-issues/)
* [ ] check the [FAQ](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/faq/)
* [ ] check the [GNU ARM Eclipse forum](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/forum/) for similar problems
* [ ] check the GitHub Issues [tracker](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/)

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use cases, if you have custom 
configurations, and generally if you have any experience that you want to share with others, 
use the [GNU ARM Eclipse forum](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/forum/).

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts, use the forum), or you have a 
pertinent suggestion how to enhance the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins, continue and register
an issue.

then why did you register a bug report, an incomplete one, btw?

isn't the following message clear enough?

this is completely non-relevant, it might depend on the Eclipse version (which you did not mention, as requested).

please follow the [bliny tutorial](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/tutorials/blinky-arm/) by the book, and you'll get a functional example.

I created a new project as follows...
File > New > C Project > and then follow the wizard
and when it created it Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings > Target Processor > ARM family is set to cortex-m33 by default.
Is there any way to override this - e.g. select cortex-m3 from plugin_customization.ini or similar?
I tried exporting the preferences before and after changing the ARM family in the project settings but there was no difference so I can't see an obvious way to capture this setting and enforce it via plugin_customization.ini.

I'm using the 3.3.1 plugins on Eclipse Luna SR2 (32 bit) on Windows 7 64 bit.
Previous versions of the plugins defaulted the project ARM family to cortex-m3 as far as I know.
If you need any more info let me know.

Thanks
Tommy

I see here (http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/debug/openocd/) under ""Quote the entire echo command"" a snippet about gdb synchronizing with openocd using the -c 'echo ""Started by GNU ARM Eclipse""' command.

Is that the sum total of synchronization between gdb and openocd?
At what point does it happen?
In particular does that synchronization ensure that openocd has initialized fully (e.g. gdb/mi port 3333 and telnet port 4444 servers if applicable etc.) or just that it has started up but may still have initialization to do?

My problem is that in some cases it looks like gdb tries to attach to openocd's gdb/mi port 3333 before openocd has successfully initialized that ""server"" and I get this:

```
Error in final launch sequence
Failed to execute MI command:
-target-select remote localhost:3333
Error message from debugger back end:
localhost:3333: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
Failed to execute MI command:
-target-select remote localhost:3333
Error message from debugger back end:
localhost:3333: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
localhost:3333: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
```
Specifically I don't  get this if I have one of our FlashPro programmers attached (driven by a custom JTAG driver that I have added to openocd). But if I have more than one then the added time taken to enumerate/init etc. these seems to delay openocd sufficiently that it has not yet initialized the gdb/mi port 3333 server by the time that gdb attempts to connect.

However even though it has not happened to date with a single programmer attached it seems to me that there is some latent race condition between gdb and openocd and it was simply luck that avoided problems previously?

Any tips on how to synchronize gdb and openocd in order to avoid this problem?

Thanks and apologies again if this is somewhat off topic from GNU ARM Eclipse proper.

let's say it is somehow related, but generally questions should be addressed via the project forum.

unfortunately it is the only portable synchronisation method I could find.

it happens when OpenOCD decides to print this message. in most cases it is when the board is ready.

I have no control over this.

for you to have a reference, the SEGGER J-Link GDB Server, by design, prints a message to confirm it is waiting for connections. this method is a good synchronisation method, and I don't recall such problems with the J-Link plug-in.

OpenOCD does not print such messages, so I had to find a workaround. I personally do not use OpenOCD, and do not recommend it to users.

if you decide to improve OpenOCD, I suggest you contribute a patch to OpenOCD, to print the waiting connection message, and later I can update the plug-ins to use it.

The period to delay will vary and must be chosen by trial and error.
One way to do this in a portable way (since Windows doesn't seem to have a workable equivalent of shell sleep x) is to use ping - e.g. change Debugger > GDB Client Setup > Commands to
```
shell ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3
set mem inaccessible-by-default off

```
Where -n specifies the number of seconds (- 1?) to delay and the value needs to be large enough to give openocd time to fully init.
But as I said it's just a hack and the value may differ from one machine/environment/load to another.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDc3MzU0MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

if you manage to push some changes to the mainstream openocd to have a stable, 100% reliable way of getting this message, even if when enabled by a switch or command, then I'll consider updating the plug-in, although we need to maintain compatibility with older versions too.

from this sequence I understand that the JTAG probe is initialised before the socket, so when the gdb client comes, everyting should be ready.

could you check your console when you encounter the problem and compare it with this sequence?

ah, right, I know it is not robust. and, although I did not measure it, I think that the ""accepting..."" message is only a few millisecond away from the echo message, which might be only marginally better, but not enough.

could you add some messages in your patched init method, one before the sleep and one after it, to see how they inteleave with the rest of the messages?

I expected the init to complete well before preparing the socket, but if openocd is multithreaded, the sleep itself may give control to the next thread, which might be the one to prepare the socket.

I did some timings of the init/string output and will post more tomorrow.
But the key issue is that the current -c 'echo ""Started by GNU MCU Eclipse""' banner is output far too early well before the gdb socket is ready.
I'm pretty sure that having the plugin check for ""accepting 'gdb' connections on tcp/"" is a fail-safe solution ensuring that gdb is not started and does not try to connect until OpenOCD is definitely ready to accept gdb RSP connections.

ok, good plan. 

the only drawback I see for this solution is that the plug-in will no longer work with older openocds, since that message was added not so long ago.

There is definitely no thread creation code in OpenOCD.
In fact openocd.c has this:

```
/** OpenOCD runtime meat that can become single-thread in future. It parse
 * commandline, reads configuration, sets up the target and starts server loop.
 * Commandline arguments are passed into this function from openocd_main().
 */
static int openocd_thread(int argc, char *argv[], struct command_context *cmd_ctx)
{
...
```
Having said that I do see multiple threads in ProcessExplorer on Windows 10 too 

```
19312	0.20	22,984,262	openocd.exe+0x14e0
18864			ntdll.dll!TpReleaseTimer+0xe0
19320			ntdll.dll!TpReleaseTimer+0xe0
```

but I suspect that threads in addition to the main one created by OpenOCD are created by the OS for its own purposes/reasons - e.g.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34822072/why-does-windows-10-start-extra-threads-in-my-program

The code itself is definitely not multithreaded.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjg5MTM4Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As such checking for ""accepting 'gdb' connection"" could be an appropriate and backward compatible check or else a check for the three possible formats outlined above?

My only other concern is that the LOG_INFO message appears **before** the call to new_connection() which may be the code that actually prepares the socket for connections in which case there could still be a race condition albeit a lot less severe than the existing one...

```
	if (service->type == CONNECTION_TCP) {
		address_size = sizeof(c->sin);

		c->fd = accept(service->fd, (struct sockaddr *)&service->sin, &address_size);
		c->fd_out = c->fd;

		/* This increases performance dramatically for e.g. GDB load which
		 * does not have a sliding window protocol.
		 *
		 * Ignore errors from this fn as it probably just means less performance
		 */
		setsockopt(c->fd,	/* socket affected */
			IPPROTO_TCP,			/* set option at TCP level */
			TCP_NODELAY,			/* name of option */
			(char *)&flag,			/* the cast is historical cruft */
			sizeof(int));			/* length of option value */

		LOG_INFO(""accepting '%s' connection on tcp/%s"", service->name, service->port);
		retval = service->new_connection(c);
		if (retval != ERROR_OK) {
			close_socket(c->fd);
			LOG_ERROR(""attempted '%s' connection rejected"", service->name);
			command_done(c->cmd_ctx);
			free(c);
			return retval;
		}
	} else if (service->type == CONNECTION_STDINOUT) {
```

Thanks - I'm looking into it now with my modified GME openocd plugin and will do some experimentation and report back.

BTW - in relation to earlier questions about the relative timing of messages from OpenOCD this might clarify:

The ""Listening on port 3333 for gdb connections"" message seems to be a SiFive addition - not sure why.
Note that the ""Started by GNU MCU Eclipse"" message appears very early on and (in relative terms) well before the ""accepting 'gdb' connections on tcp/3333"" message.
In some (many?) cases the intervening initialization will happen ""quick enough"" that by the time the plugin starts gdb and it tries to make a GDB RSP connection to port 3333 everything is ready and it works.
But in some cases (e.g. a JTAG interface driver that takes ""longer"" to init - such as ours) then this will not be the case and GDB will be launched and will attempt a GDB RSP connection to 3333 before the socket it completely ready.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjkwMzY2NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The ""accepting 'gdb' connections on tcp/3333"" message does't appear there even though it is appearing in the OpenOCD log in Eclipse and is going to the stderr as it's coloured red in the console and other LOG_INFO messages are obviously visible to the plugin Java code.

Just to clarify - Anton sees ""Started by GNU ARM Eclipse"" last because he is using a version of OpenOCD with my ugly hack that moves this log message to the end of openocd.c:openocd_thread() instead of it appearing at the start as it normally does in the unhacked openocd.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzAyMjc0Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

By the way, I found that GDB 8.0 + OpenOCD 0.10.0 in most case unusable combination in case, when some RTOS (ThreadX in my case) is used and RTOS support module used by OpenOCD. Often I observe such messages when try to stop process:
```
Cannot execute this command without a live selected thread.
```
All work good with GDB 7.7.1 (original) and 7.8 (Linaro branch) and OpenOCD 0.10.0. Currently I have no ideas how it report and just freeze used GDB version.

Issue found on Manjaro Linux using GDB located in repos and Qt Creator, but I reproduce issues using only GDB and OpenOCD from command line. I deal with Cypress FX3 chip in our production board.

GDB console doesn't appear when connecting via pyOCD plugin, in either of the Console or Debugger Console views. This is with Neon.2. (Haven't tried other plugins for comparison as I don't have a setup readily available.)

I checked the commit logs back to May 2016 and didn't notice anything obvious that was changed in other plugins but not pyOCD regarding the gdb console. I did see commit 2494e5b7f8 regarding `IGdbDebugConstants.GDB_PROCESS_CREATION_VALUE`, but that didn't seem to be directly related.

Of course, I'm happy to work on a fix, just not sure where to look.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a valid pyOCD launch config.
2. Launch the config.

**Expected behavior:** GDB console appears under Debugger Console.

**Actual behavior:** No GDB console visible.

### Versions

* Plugins 3.4.1, pyOCD 1.1.3
* Neon.2 (4.6.2)
* Java 8 update 65
* macOS 10.11.6
* GNU ARM Embedded gcc 5.4.1 20160919, gdb 7.10.1.20160923

the GDB console **is** present, but it is now a separate tab. 

the GDB trace console is no longer visible by default, you need to enable it somewhere deep in the preferences pages.

both are considered 'features', according to the CDT team...

anyway, Neon.2 and GDB 7.12 is a no-go.

please retest with Neon.3, to be released soon.

wow! there may be some kind of magic behind the plug-ins! ;-)

I did the following
- created a STM32F407 blinky project
- created a new build configuration named Debug-64, copied from the original Debug
- in the Toolchains tab, I changed the architecture to ARM64
- closed the Properties page
- entered again the Properties page and checked C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols
- all Includes were exactly where the wizard entered them in the beginning

So, the magic did not work for me.

Please provide detailed steps on how to reproduce the problem.

It may very well be the case that the magic is sitting in front of the computer...

When I do the same thing as you (using STM32F407 ...), I get the same results.

However, originally, I started out with a Hello World ARM C++ Project. Initially, that one has several includes. These, however are not listed under C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols, however I can reference them.

That means that my choice of project template is somehow unsuitable I guess!?

but for this you need to have a proper compiler, if CDT cannot start the compiler, you have no system includes.

the project created by the Hello World wizard has no local include folders itself, so it is normal for the window you are mention to be empty, regardless the compiler you are using.

it looks like there is not much magic left...

Just to recap - on a clean installation (Eclipse, CDT, GME plugins etc.) Window > Preferences > C/C++ > Debug > GDB does not appear in the Preferences dialog.
After a GDB OpenOCD Debugging debug session is attempted (doesn't even have to succeed) then Window > Preferences > C/C++ > Debug > GDB does appear in the Preferences dialog.
It's like something in the act of trying a debug session changes some state allowing this option to appear in the Preferences.
I haven't tried to see if any other action (e.g. starting ANY debug session - not just GDB OpenOCD Debugging session) triggers this.
Do you not get the same behaviour on Mac?

I doubt so. do you really have the first archive, the archive is valid, not truncated, and the files are **not** there?

do you have the habit of changing the files to r/o after installing from an archive? sometimes it might help.

The following URL is returning a javascript-filled web page instead of a PDSC file:
 http://gd32mcu.21ic.com/data/documents/yingyongruanjian/GigaDeviceGD32F1x0_DFP.pdsc

This is causing my Eclipse installation to crash (unrecoverable except by killing the process) whenever I attempt to refresh the packs.

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Refresh packs (as of 7 April 2017).

**Expected behavior:** Packs are refreshed, skipping any bad or un-parseable results from the list of pack URLs
**Actual behavior:** Eclipse crashes on bad PDSC URL

as I already said, pressing terminate in the context of JLinkGDBServer simply sends the terminate signal to the JLinkGDBServer. similarly pressing terminate in the context of GSB sends the terminate signal to the GDB process.

each time the termination of one process drags the other processes down.

it is very hard to diagnose such a problem, where multiple processes terminate in a more or less orderly way.

To be clear, when you talk about the ""unwanted reset"" do you mean for 
gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q1-update 
or
gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q3 (or older for that matter). Did you mean halt or reset?

For gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q1-update it seems to actually HALT the program when terminating on the Thread and for gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q3 (and older) it seems to just continue the program (not reset) after terminating on the thread. 

And yes, both continue when terminating the GDB sever. 

For context I am running the latest JLink software/firmware V6.14c

it is quite easy to make a small change in the setup so you can use both gdb versions:
- go to the gcc 6 bin folder and rename `arm-none-eabi-gdb` to `arm-none-eabi-gdb-7.12`
- make a symlink from gcc 5 `arm-none-eabi-gdb` to gcc 6 `arm-none-eabi-gdb`

when you need to use gdb 7.12, edit the GDB client executable field in the debug configuration and add `-7.12` at the end

I would say that the difference is only in the inconsistent naming convention.

The Stop button in the new toolbar was probably inspired by the Arduino environment, the Terminate button is from the traditional Eclipse debug plug-ins.

I'm not sure about the new button, but the old one was intended to terminate the selected process (the debugged target, the gdb client, the gdb server, etc). So the behaviour is different if you select different processes and then push the Terminate button.

for example if you kill the gdb server, the client will also die, and the target will follow soon.

if you want to also reset the target, you need to check the j-link documentation, perhaps there is an option to set.

Neither the red button on top left of the Debug/Run drop down menu nor the red button on the controls that stops steps over etc.. works on my case. All the processes are getting terminated except Semihosting and SWV. Terminating the thread first helps sometimes but not always on my end. 

I tried starting the eclipse with console and query the threads. Although  inititally being there, after this incidence, I cannot find the Semihosting and SWV there. That makes me suspect that, it is terminated but its state is not catched. This prevents restarting the debugging session. Restarting eclipse solves the problem but incredibly annoying.

We are using eclipse 2018-12 with cdt v9.6.0 and the gnu mcu plugin v4.7.2 running on Windows OS.
We see equal behavior as reported in this issue. Using the arm-none-eabi-gdb and JLinkGDBServerCL.exe in console commands closing the debug session does not halt the target, it works. But using it within Eclipse it is as described in this issue

What we have found out with log files so far is, that with use in console the gdb server from segger reports the following after TCP connect has closed/terminated by GDB:

I don't know if it's the cause of your problem but Windows CDT's `starter.exe` is definitely very, and arguably excessively, aggressive in how it terminates processes that it previously started. (And obviously this is not a GNU MCU Eclipse/Eclipse Embedded CDT plugin issue).

* https://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/tree/core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/library/starter/starter.cpp?h=cdt_9_6

It basically sends the equivalent of a `Ctrl-C` to the process (and sometimes multiple `Ctrl-C`'s) and more or less immediately calls `TerminateJobObject()` on it without giving it much time to do a graceful cleanup and exit. In many cases this does not matter but in some it will. 

I had to make a local ugly hack to it to be less aggressive when terminating openocd.exe specifically because our version needed time to clean up and terminate gracefully. I have attached this but, to date, never had a chance to clean it up, generalize it and submit a pull request to see if I could get it upstreamed. 

* [starter.cpp.txt](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/files/6623247/starter.cpp.txt)

Note: I had to rename it from `starter.cpp` to `starter.cpp.txt` to attach it. See the ""MICROSEMI"" comments/`#ifdef`'s.

Hi Jonah 
Yes - I agree and that is my intention but I would need to generalize it (e.g. it's specific to `openocd.exe` in my hack because I was being cautious) and clean it up (e.g. I was never really sure about the wide char/Unicode string parsing but just did what I had to do to get something functional for my own purposes.
I will see if I can do something on this in the next week or so.

As I mentioned I suspect that most processes have no problems with being terminated so aggressively but some that require ""some time"" to clean up and terminate gracefully may end up being terminated ""too soon"" by existing `starter.exe`.

@gemschl - if you want to try this then change this line:

* `sg_target_process.f_is_openocd = (wcsstr(argv[8], L""openocd"") != NULL);`

to

* `sg_target_process.f_is_openocd = (wcsstr(argv[8], L""JLinkGDBServerCL.exe"") != NULL);`

(I guess?) and then compile the changes as follows (I used TDM-GCC for Windows):
```
all:	clean starter.exe

clean:	
	rm -rf starter.exe starter.o

starter.exe:	starter.o
	g++ -m64 -static starter.o -o starter.exe -lpsapi
	strip starter.exe

starter.o:	starter.cpp
	g++ -m64 -DMICROSEMI -DUNICODE -c -municode starter.cpp
```
And then drop the modified `starter.exe` into your CDT installation:

Yes - look at Process Explorer or similar when a debug session is running and you will see various ""intermediary"" `starter.exe` processes.

(a) apply the change to all processes - not just `openocd.exe` as in my hack, and

Yes on both counts. 

My inclination is to rewrite in JNA and get rid of starter.exe altogether, but lets discuss that in CDT land.

For now I am going to close this issue, once a bug is submitted in CDT it would be nice to add a link to it here so that @gemschl and others know where to continue the conversation.

If the original issue was related to how the CDT for Windows `starter.exe` was ""too aggressive"" in how it terminated processes then your suggestion isn't really a fix for the root cause of the problem. See the previous detailed discussion for more on the specifics. However, at least some of this may be moot if, as I suspect, significant changes have been made to `starter.exe` in the intervening years - in particular fixes/changes to how `starter.exe` handles process termination.

not directly, maybe it is a CDT side effect, the file may be created by the indexer, and the wrong path may be the result of a parsing problem.

even if you can, you have to do it again on Neon.3; Luna is much too old to be of any value.

**_Edit: ignore all that messing around as it's irrelevant. Just change a relative include path such as ""../include"" to the equivalent that uses Eclipse variables such as ""${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/include}"", save the project properties and the Problems view will update soon after to show the ""Invalid project path: Duplicate path entries found"" warning._**

For some reason when the include paths are specified in this format, using Eclipse variables to refer to the workspace and project, it causes this warning but I don't understand why. I was able to reproduce it with a GME STM32F4 template generated example project but I strongly suspect that this is a CDT rather than a GME issue. 

I haven't been able to identify a reproducible test case for the ""Include path not found"" warning mentioned above (and in the screenshot) so far.

yeah, while working on the mbedOS exporter, I experimented with generating the .cproject file and when I tried to group the Debug/Release folders below a build folder, I had problems.

CDT really does not work if the build folders are moved in a different location.

Compatibility with existing workspaces is not guaranteed, since it might require resetting some perspectives, thus the recommendation to create a new workspace and import the projects there.

Compatibility with 3rd party plug-ins could not be preserved, since the package names and IDs had to be changed to match the Eclipse Foundation requirements.

Another change is the minimum Eclipse, which is now 2020-09.

So, for a while, I suggest you stick with the latest v5 for your production builds, and in the meantime update for the new v6.

``` 

So my problem ist the  line:
```shell
c:/program files (x86)/gnu arm eclipse/build tools/2.8-201611221915/bin/sh: syntax error: unexpected ""(""
```
When I tried to add and build a empty ""Hello World Cross ARM project"" the build works as expected. So I do not think it isn´t a toolchain or build tools issue. It is really strange for me. 

I use the a Eclipse Neon.3 and my target OS is WIN10 

many thanks
cheers

The app IS NOT blinking (target halted in theory)
Click on [debugconfig name] and shows the app the Eclipse Menu which does not show a Resume Button(gray) but the Suspend and Terminate buttons are active. Its supposed to be halted according to openocd.

If I dont do that and simple Resume, no Blinking, seems to be stuck in a loop at  0x40000400 WHICH IS NOT  the entry point.

Have tried everything, can u help.

The basis for this is that when I do the “manual” debugging, that is, load openocd (plain and simple) and then load xtensa-gdb (again without parameters) it works, it blinks, stops, resumes,print vars, shows threads, hits breakpoints, etc. When the same two apps are called from Eclipse it does not and is stuck at a point that is not part of the Blink app or the flashed code . Also, when using the manual option there is an X list of threads and when done via Eclipse its different.

Anyway, how can I proceed or where to get suggestions and help. I presume that you are stating that this request will not go any further and I have to look for other ways of solving it.

Regards.

Is there any plan to add read/write support for the CP15 registers?
I know that it would require some extension of the CDT debugger (that I am not sure it can come from CDT since it is CPU core dependent) and also support from the JTAG backend (SEGGER support it), but it would be of a great help for a more complete ARM core control

I have  find a strange Issue debugging with Eclipse Luna Service Release 2 (4.4.2) and J-Link Ultra+  for ARM Cortex R4 Target in C.

Common C projects right debug, but in this, I have a nested structure whose pointer is to procedures sended.

```c
typedef struct temperatureReg_s
{
    int8_t integerPart; //MSB  (Write/Read first)
    uint8_t fractionalPart; // LSB
} temperatureReg_t;

typedef struct tempLimits_s{
    temperatureReg_t lowLimit;
    temperatureReg_t highLimit;
}tempLimits_t;

typedef struct pRegister_s
{
    int8_t tempRegister;	//= 0x00; Temperature pointer Register
    int8_t configReg;    //= 0x01;
    int8_t tLowReg;	//= 0x02;
    int8_t tHighReg; // = 0x03;
} PointerRegister_t;

typedef struct temperatureSensor_s
{
    const int8_t            i2CAddress;     //= 0x4A; //Without the eighth (R/W) bit
    const int8_t            genCallAdd;		//= 0x00;
    const PointerRegister_t   pReg;
    int16_t                 nBytesData; //nBytes2send/endbyte for each data type
    int16_t                 currentByte;
    uint8_t                  *data;

}tSens_t;
```

I said strange, because when I set two breakpoints bettwen the calls to procedures, work without problems: 

```c
void tSDrv_writeValues(tSens_t *tSens, const int8_t *pointReg, int16_t nBytesData)
 {
                                   /*1*/   i2c_setBusIdle(50020000);
                                   /*2*/   i2c_startCommand(1300);
--->(breakpoint here) /*3*/   if(pointReg != &tSens->genCallAdd) tSDrv_sendChipAdMode(tSens, I2C_WRITE);
--->(breakpoint here) /*4*/   tSDrv_sendRegisterAD(tSens, pointReg);
                                 /*5*/   tsDrv_sendData(tSens, nBytesData);
        i2c_stop(50020000);
 }
```

But without thems, I get the following error:

```
Target connection lost

Failed to execute MI command:
          -data-disassemble -s 0 -e 132 -- 3
          Error message from debugger back end:
          Cannot access memory at address 0x0
```

Greetings and thansk in advance.

It would be useful to also test in exactly the same environment, but with the J-Link GDB server started manually, and the standard GNU Hardware Debugging plug-in instead of my J-Link plug-in.

I also suggest you enable the gdb tracing (Properties -> C/C++ -> Debug -> GDB), perhaps you can spot something unusual.

you can also try a debug session with the SEGGER Oxygen standalone debugger.

I'm a bit confused by the version numbering. You announced the v4.6.3 GME plugins here:

https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/d/msg/sw-dev/4sC6Fi_5pyA/vJdsedOFCQAJ

But this version is v4.1.5. Or is the versioning of all GME plugins ""bundle"" separate from the versioning of individual component plugins?

BTW - I think that it was reported before/elsewhere (can't find it mentioned in issue tracker though) but the Main > C/C++ Application field gets filled in with a relative path using a backslash rather than a forward slash which is a small barrier to portability (i.e. will not work on Linux/non Windows OSs) whereas a forward slash seems to be globally portable. Would it be possible to have forward slash used on Windows too? Will I open a separate issue for this?

for the GNU MCU Eclipse product, the version reflects the original version, like v4.6.3, followed by  the date (20170606-0936).

for the GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins, the version reflects the version of the entire update site, which, unfortunately, does not show when you list the features, but is indeed the version used to publish the update site (https://bintray.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/v4-neon-updates-experimental/p2)

each Eclipse bundle has its own version.

each Eclipse feature has its own version. 

one or more bundles are referred by one or more features. generally each feature has a main bundle, with a similar name, and the same version.

with all this chaos, at run-time, you can find the original repository version by searching for the ilg.gnumcueclipse.core plug-in, which artificially follows the version of the repository.

so, when you encounter a reference to GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins version x.y.x-YYYYMMDDHHMM, the really relevant part is the date, which must be the same for all features, plug-ins, repository, etc. since it identifies the build time.

given the above explanation, ""check version 4.1.1-201706082015"" means get a version from the update site with a date later than 20170608-2015. since 20170608-2109 is later, yes, this a suitable version to test.

On Windows a debug launch configuration created when there is a project selected in the Project Explorer will try to automatically fill out the Main > C/C++ Application field with a reference to the executable to be debugged (or the user can browse/search the project to select one if necessary).
On Windows a backslash is used - e.g. Debug\myproject.elf. 
On Linux/non Windows a forward slash is used - e.g. Debug/myproject.elf.
The backslash will not work on non Windows platforms.
The forward slash is portable across Windows and Linux/non Windows platforms.
As such it would be better if a forward slash was used for portability.
Otherwise the Windows user must manually edit the field to change backslash to forward slash if the debug launch configuration is to be portable to non Windows OSs.

As explained in #207 by Liviu this behaviour comes not from the GNU MCU Eclipse plugins but from CDT itself - and a deprecated class at that (TabMain).
It would be good to identify a fix/mod that would allow forward slashes to be used as standard regardless of the host OS.
At the moment I cannot propose a solution.

only when the debug configurations are explicitly saved in the project (Tab Common -> Save as -> Shared file) this becomes an issue.

the solution implies identifying the new class for the Main tab (to fix the deprecation warning) and creating a new class derived from it, with the additional behaviour of rewriting the path with the POSIX separators, then using this new class in the debugging plug-ins.

I, personally, hate that. Each time you move your workspace (another location, an external disk, another computer, etc.) there is something missing.
So I make self sufficient workspace with every tools I need in it (including eclipse). No absolute path at all. I can click on workspace I didn't open in years and everything compile.
For me, it's an illusion to believe that few years later, you still have the old gcc you need to compile an old project, located at the same path. At least for me, it never happened. Change of computer, reinstall of operating system, etc.
Also, I can download from my NAS on whatever computer I have and run without config.

There is this page https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5-3rd-party-Hardware-specification
However Arduino starts from boards. Boards are delivered by a platform.
From a toolchain perspective it is important to know platform=toolchain and toolchain commands (defined as recipes in platform.txt).
Platforms are described in json files. The json files point to archives that contain the tools for the toolchain. The manager needs to downloaded and install these tools for the platform to  be available.
Plenty of hardware providers have created a json file for their boards as you can see here https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Unofficial-list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls

In theory all these boards work with sloeber. My last test successfully did +400 boards.

How you implement this is up to the toolbuilder. Simplified Sloeber puts all info in boards.txt and platform.txt in environment variables. Sloeber also defines a toolchain based on the recipe environment variables. This makes it possible to swap the toolchain without changing the toolchain at the CDT level.

Note that it is perfectly possible to use the toolchains without using the arduino core. https://github.com/grbl/grbl is a nice example.

>any suggestions?

I think it would be good to have a look at each others tools. We both started from somewhere and grew over the years and now start overlapping. Things won't magically fit and the 2 entry points will remain but in the overlapping zone it is no use doing things twice.
I already shopped debugging with you.
Given the comments above it looks as if you are looking for a way to get many toolchains working quickly. If so Sloeber can help you out.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODg5NTIwOA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In addition to ARM, it'll also support RISC-V devices.

For future versions I'm considering adding a mechanism to install/update/manage multiple-versions of ARM & RISC-V toolchains, OpenCOD, QEMU, etc.

Both command line and GUI solutions should be considered, with the CLI version having the top priority.

The tools should be very simple to use, and prevent mistakes, like using a 64-bits binary on a 32-bits system.

The planned interface is inspired by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). The descriptions for the binary tools can be stored as npm packages on the npm public registry.

The typical use case might look like:

```bash
$ xpm install @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

which will install the latest version of the ARM toolchain, in a default location.

A specific version of the binaries can be installed by explicitly giving the version, using the npm syntax:

```bash
$ xpm install @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc@6.2.1
```

The result of the install is a 3 levels hierarchy, `<scope>/<name>/<version>`, for example `gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/6.2.1` for the above command.

For more generality, the `xpm` tool should be able to install binaries in 3 locations:

- in the current folder (for example when used with a studio like application)
- in a folder below the user home (for example `${HOME}/opt`)
- in a system folder (for example `/usr/opt/`)

The supported binaries are compressed archives, stored on any public server, for example the ARM server, or GitHub Releases. The actual npm packages do not need to include the binaries, links to the actual addresses should be enough.

Any comments/suggestions are highly appreciated.

Arduino stores their stuff in /users/[user]/AppData/Local/Arduino15. This is a system central place.
I don't like this because
1) Arduino does not support multiple versions of the same tool making it impossible to have 2 locations using a different version. (Sloeber allows you to use different versions of the same platform->tool)
2) I don't like the ""it is somewhere on my system and I don't know where.
3) Downgrading is impossible.
4) Upgrading centrally enforces you to upgrade everything.
Once there you have packages\[provider]\tools\[tool name like arm-none-eabi-gcc]\[version]
Sloeber puts the data in [Eclipse install]\arduinoPlugin and then follows the Arduio folder names.

The install goes different in Arduino world. The biggest question is ""what do I need to install"". The nice thing of starting from boards is that you can tell which ""toolchain"" you need.
So a platform uses tools (of course with versions) and the tools are defined in a json as follows

as a generic tool, `xpm` installs any generic binaries, in a given location. actually installing these binaries is only the first and simplest xPack application, since I plan to use `xpm` to install source packages and compose projects from components. 

somehow similar to `npm` which manages **node.js** modules, `xpm` will manage **xPacks**. and by _manage_ I mean it will handle dependencies, since packages can ask for other packages to be present, with specific versions or version ranges. packages content is unspecified and can be anything (source files, metadata, tools, etc), all that matters is to have all dependencies satisfied. a higher level tool is expected to make something useful with the content of the xPacks.

in practical terms, what can be used from the Arduino/Sloeber design in the xPacks design?

The concept of a json file defining the packages that need to be known by CDT. (decide what to install)
After all once the packages are installed CDT needs to know which packages(that is inclusive version) to use for which project and needs to know where to find these.
The concept of platform.txt because you need to specify which commands you need to run to build.(tell the higher level tool how to make something useful with the content of the xPacks)
The concept of menu's to influence the build/upload/run/debug or whatever you need eclipse to do.
The concept of putting this information in the environment variables and configure cdt from environment variables.
Whether you download and extract a archive or run a xpm command is a pure implementation matter. Extending Sloeber to also support xpm commands could be a win win. 

Looking at this from a conceptual point of view, I think that as a IDE provider there are 3 main strategies to go around the problem of multi toolchain development.
1) Don't care (this is what CDT does -eclipse legal enforced-)
2) Take control and become the single point of contact to extend/change the toolchains (this is what platform io does)
3) Have a documented way of doing things and let others provide toolchains (That is what Arduino/Sloeber does)

The advantage of 3 is that ""others do the work"" the disadvantage is that ""you need to specify and document how they can do the work"" 
This means figuring out a framework, document it and ""making it work""
The ""target"" framework needs to satisfy following requirements (in Arduino there is also a library framework.) I'm using target as it maps very well on the target as defined in CDT with the work done by dough for his arduino implementation.

1) Let the end user select targets to install/remove.
2) The tool will Install/remove tools based on the installed targets
3) Let the user create a project based on a target. (note in cdt it can also be a configuration)
4) The tool will select the toolchain and build commands based on the target
5) let the end user select build options (limited by the selected toolchain) 
6) The tool will execute the build taking into account the build commands and build options using the correct toolchain.

reuse is always a good advice, as long as the desired functionality is covered. and the trick is to figure out how to do it. ;-)

> The concept of a json file defining the packages that need to be known by CDT.

if you make a step back and try to see the broader picture, this is the concept of some metadata associated with the useful data available in the package.

npm defines a package as a folder or an archived folder that has a `package.json` file with a few mandatory properties, like name and version. 

in a true object oriented way, xpm packages are npm packages with a mandatory `xpack` property. it's as simple as that. the complicated part is the semantic behind it...

> platform.txt ... menus ... target

these are related more to project management and to the builds than to the packages themselves.

fyi, for builds, I consider a tool called `xmake`, which should be part make, part cmake, part wh knows what. an experimental `xmake` is https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmake. I started to implement features to import/export Eclipse projects, but I had to delay it for a while.

xpm, as an xPack package manager, should be be able to manage generic packages, and preferably delegate the project and build management to other tools.

similarly, npm does a fairly good job on managing node.js modules, including executable modules; npm itself is such an executable module, and xpm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm) follows the same path.

neither npm nor xpm are specific to an IDE, and even less to Eclipse CDT.

> 3 main strategies to go around the problem of multi toolchain development.

the multi toolchain problem is a specific version of the multi-tool problem, for example there can also be multiple versions for the OpenOCD binaries, QEMU binaries, SEGGER J-Link binaries, and so on.

if projects are also xPacks, it shouldn't be difficult to add explicit dependencies to specific tools to be used during the project lifetime using the xpm dependency mechanism. this dependency mechanism can be direct, i.e. the project can have an explicit dependency to a specific tool, or indirect, for example the project can have a dependency to another xPack which defines a class/group/category/etc the package adheres (like Arduino platforms, targets, etc), and that package to have explicit dependencies to different tool (like toolchains).

I'll try to prepare some more detailed specifications for the `xpm install` command, and see how much of the Arduino/Sloeber experience can be reused.

for now I have a preliminary tool (`xpm install`) that installs the RISC-V toolchain (https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-xpack).

```console
$ xpm install @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc --global
```

the idea is that all packages are always downloaded via a cache to a central repository in the home folder. 

* some tools may be thought to inspect this central folder, it is not a big deal to process some json files
* xPack based projects will have explicit references to given versions, and in this case links to the binaries will be added to the referring project, for convenient usage. 
* if really needed, similar links can be added to a system folder (like `/usr/local/bin`, so the given version of the tool becomes visible for all.

my first use for this tool is to install the toolchain and qemu on travis, to test projects generated by a template project (https://github.com/micro-os-plus/sifive-templates-xpack)

hopefully these days I'll test it on other platforms and publish the result.

and please be warned, the xPack tools are still experimental. for now I only used them on macOS, did not try on other platforms, most probably fail.

and the sifive-template-xpack is currently half xpack, half npm module (it handles dependencies via npm instead of xpm, since xpm is not ready).

yes, you should be able to run it, `xpm` is actually a npm command line application, and should run on any platform

generally everything is configurable. there are to xPack specific folders, configurable with environment varibles, the repository folder and the cache folder

all archives are dowloaded to the cache, then expanded in the repository folder. this is where multi-version packages sit together in separate folders like `.../xPacks/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/7.2.0`

if you start `xpm install` in a standalone folder, you get a copy of the package there.

`xpm install @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc -C C:\test`
Which did installl some stuff in c:\test but no binaries. What I'm trying to say is that I used the wrong command or there is something wrong (like my understanding).
One of the things I realized when reading through all the doc is that xpm uses a package.json and Arduino uses a package-index.json (in other words a list of package.json's).
The reason for this is that you (in Arduino language the provider) must specify which package.json's he is ""providing"". Providers can then add their index.json here https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Unofficial-list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls.
Can you share your thought on the index concept?

no, you did use the right command, and yes, there is something wrong: the `xpm install` command is not yet fully implemented :-(

> Can you share your thought on the index concept?

well, as long as you use it, and are happy with it, I guess it is ok.

however, npm (and xpm) uses a different approach, each package is independent and has its list of dependencies. 

when you install an npm package (if you installed xpm, you just did it), you get not only the desired package code, but a folder called `node_modules`, where all dependencies are installed; each dependency is also independednt and has its dependencies, and this goes as deep as it needs (and works very well).

the interesting part is that in this hierarchy of dependencies, you can encounter multiple versions of a package in different locations, and the JavaScript engine can perfectly make sense of them.

also interesting is how npm isolates each package at its level when dealing with executable tools: each package has a subfolder `npm_modules/.bin` where are added links (or short `.cmd` scripts on windows) to the actual tools located in subfolders of `node_modules`. before executing any sub-process, npm adds `npm_modules/.bin` in front of the PATH, so local binaries are prefered.

xpm takes a slightly different approach. it also adds a `xpacks/.bin` subfolder, and adds it in front of  the local PATH, but the dependent packages (actually all packages) are installed in the central repository, each version in a separate folder. in the project folder, by default, `xpacks` includes links to the required versions in the repository, not the packages themselves.

for short source libraries this does not make much difference, but for large binary packages, like toolchains, it saves quite a lot of space.

`xpm install` is not yet fully functional, it does not install dependencies, so you cannot thest this, but imagine we have a small package with a blinky project, a `src` folder with a `main.c` and possibly an `include` with some header. in the `package.json` are dependencies to many other packages with source code that are required for a successful build; but not only, there are also dependencies to binary packages, like a toolchain, OpenOCD, possibly a binnary version of make on Windows, etc.

right now, if you use `xpm install` you get the small blinky package installed in the central repository and into the local folder.

when ready, `xpm install` will also install all dependencies (sources and binaries) in the central repository, add links in `xpacks` and, for binaries, add links in `.bin`. if you run build in the project folder (with something like `xpm build`), you get two more folders, something like `build/something-debug` and `build/something-release`, where the debug/release builds are performed.

I guess this helps you better understand the concept used by npm (and xpm).

as for the index, Arduino may use an index to refer to related packages, but you still need to maintain pages with urls to these index files, then you have to promote these pages, since if people do not know your page with urls, they have no chance to install your packages.

npm fully automates this, all packages are published onto the central server (https://www.npmjs.com), and, if you need a package, you simply search for it, it is exists, it must be there. (well, to be fully correct, npm can also install packages from other sources, like git repos, archives, and even private servers that implement the npm protocol, like bintray, but I would consider them special use cases).

npm is a very powerful solution for JavaScript modules. I'm trying to make xpm an even more powerful and generic solution, mainly for C/C++ projects, but I guess it can be used for other languages too.

of course your milage may vary, Arduino uses a different approach, and there are very elaborate tools, including your plug-ins, that make great use of them.

however, I consider the npm/xpm mechanism more generic, and I plan to further develop the xpm tools. unfortunately I cannot dedicate as much time as I would like to this project, but more work is planned for the next few weeks.

as an immediate use of this technology, I plan to use it to run the µOS++ tests on CI servers, like Travis; I don't know if you can create Arduino projects from a command line terminal, but with xpm it is quite simple, all you have to do is 

```console
$ xpm install xxx
$ cd xxx
$ xpm test
```

or `xpm build` if you want to run only the compile step.

Documentation and default config only provides the default config pointing to keil.com server. As of now happens keil.com servers are down and working with it is pointless (not your fault thought).

What we can do better to avoid issues, to have alternative urls for keil.com in cmsis pack config. Or at least document possible aditional urls. If they exists of course. Single fail would not bring down entire system

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Try searching info in documentation for aditional mirror of cmsis. At least I found none. If they exist at all?
2. There is no hints in default config about mirrors.

**Expected behaviour:** Config if main url fail should either automatically select next one or if automatic behaviour undesirable, atleast have aditional entry in cmsis pack urls for user to change manually. Also aditional mirrors if exists any should be documented

**Actual behaviour:** As stands now I failed to find any info even if cmsis alternative mirrors exist. Keil.com is down and *entire* build cmsys build pack system is useless because I cannot get pack for my board. Atleast it should be noted in documentation if alternatives exist or does not.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/211/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the default interface is swd, so this setting is widely used, but I've never seen any error message related to it.

normally yes.

unfortunately the RISC-V specific options are too many/too complex, and it is very difficult to validate them in Eclipse.

simple buttons can be enabled/disabled acording to some conditions, but combo boxes cannot be restricted to certain values depending on other options, or it is very difficult to do it.

if you have concrete proposals for additional validation, please let me know, but I cannot guarantee the implementation is possible.

this is usual for other settings pages, but for the page with toolchain details I'm not sure it is possible, the current behaviour comes only from a large xml, not from java code.

The problem is: ""ERROR: Verification of RAMCode failed @ address 0x24000000."" The J-Link uses RAM at the address 0x24000000 as work RAM. The CPU I'm using has no RAM at this address, so the access to this address fails. How can I setup the work RAM range in the plugin?
According to the [this article](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/debug/jlink/#no-gdb-initialisation-files-loaded) .gdbinit file is not loaded by the plugin. Instead the command should be added to the commands filed of the GDB client setup in the debugger tab. I've tried adding `monitor WorkRAM = 0x00000000-0x00000000` to this command field, but it leads to another error:

> Error in final launch sequence
> Failed to execute MI command:
> monitor WorkRAM = 0x00000000-0x00000000
> Error message from debugger back end:
> ""monitor"" command not supported by this target.
> Failed to execute MI command:
> monitor WorkRAM = 0x00000000-0x00000000
> Error message from debugger back end:
> ""monitor"" command not supported by this target.
> ""monitor"" command not supported by this target.

I've tried loading a settings file using the -settingsfile command line option of the JLinkGDBServerCL without success. It seems like the settings file is ignored.
I've added the command `monitor WorkRAM = 0x00000000-0x00000000` to the Initialization commands field in the startup tab. This worked for a few downloads and then stopped working. The address 0x24000000 is still accessed and leads to the above error.
How can I specifiy the work RAM are for the J-Link debugger in the plugin?

The issue is with the command to run a clean build using Eclipse headless. This is the command I am using:

`Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse --launcher.suppressErrors -nosplash -data ""/Users/andrewlee/git/SwingJS"" -application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild -cleanBuild ""swingjs""
`

This is essentially the structure of the command listed here [GNU ARM Eclipse](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/advanced/headless-builds/) (Looking at the main docs page of Eclipse is unhelpful as well).

The specific error message I am getting is as following:

```org.eclipse.logback.configuration: The org.eclipse.m2e.logback.configuration bundle was activated before the state location was initialized. Will try after the state location is initialized.
org.eclipse.m2e.logback.configuration: Logback config file: /Users/andrewlee/git/SwingJS/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.m2e.logback.configuration/logback.1.7.0.20160603-1933.xml

WARNING: No Project matched ""swingjs"". Skipping...
```

Now the paths I have in the command are correct as far as I know.

Project directory is not in ```.../workspace/SwingJS``` since I imported the project from Git using the Eclipse Git tool, and in that case, it keeps the project in ```$HOME/git/Project``` by default.

Furthermore, the Project name should be ""swingjs"", yet in the log, it says ""WARNING: No Project matched ""swingjs"". Skipping...""

I would appreciate if someone who has actually successfully done this before gave me the specific commands they used to clean build an Eclipse project headlessly.

As discussed in the [forum](https://www.element14.com/community/message/225441/l/re-synchronize-devicesperipheral-view-with-cmsis-pack-installed-from-cmsis-pack-eclipse-plugin#225441), it seems the Packs plugin from GNU MCU Eclipse is not able to detect packs installed with the [cmsis-pack-eclipse](https://github.com/ARM-software/cmsis-pack-eclipse) plugin. Even after removing the cache file, it wasn't able to re-scan the installed packs. Both plugins were configured to point to the same location.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Offline install a pack using the CMSIS-Pack manager [cmsis-pack-eclipse](https://github.com/ARM-software/cmsis-pack-eclipse) plugin
2. Create a new RTE project for this device, go to project properties and observe that the Device tab is empty.
3. Also, In the Packs tab (from the GNU MCU Eclipse not the CMSIS-Pack Manager tab), the list of installed packs is empty. 

**Expected behaviour:** Devices tab is updated regardless of which plugin installed a pack since they point to the same packs_path

**Actual behaviour:** Devices tab is always empty

### Versions

* Plug-in: ilg.gnuarmeclipse.repository-3.4.1-201704251808

* Windows 7

The specific URL I was trying is: https://dl.bintray.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/v4-neon-updates/content.xml, and the output is below.

The solution is to install Oracle JDK.

A possible workaround is to recreate the certificates:

```
# 1. Save an empty JKS file with the default 'changeit' password for Java cacerts.
#    Use 'printf' instead of 'echo' for Dockerfile RUN compatibility.
/usr/bin/printf '\xfe\xed\xfe\xed\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x00\xe2\x68\x6e\x45\xfb\x43\xdf\xa4\xd9\x92\xdd\x41\xce\xb6\xb2\x1c\x63\x30\xd7\x92' > /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts

you need to first run the printf command before recreating the certificates. I don't know what the binary values mean, but the result is that it clears the wrong definitions and the correct certificates can be recreated.

the safe solution is to use Oracle Java.

When using the PyOCD debugging plug in with an unknown board it is necessary to override the target device as PyOCD cannot figure this out automatically.  The target choices provided for the override target field in the debugger tab of the PyOCD debug configurations window are all in upper case, but the PyOCD GDB server expects the target to be specified in lower case with the result that the PyOCD GDB server fails to start.  Manually overtyping in the override target field the desired target in lower case will result in the PyOCD GDB server successfully starting.

### Steps to Reproduce

Connect an unknown DAPLINK board to the computer (I'm using a Red Bear Blend 2).

1. Open the C/C++ perspective
2. Select Run -> Debug Configurations ... from the menu bar
3. Create a new ""GDB PyOCD Debugging"" configuration
4. Select the Debugger tab
5. Push the refresh button next to the board field and select the unknown board.
6. Select the tick box next to the override target field 
7. Select the target device for the unknown board in the override target field list box.  Note that all the target device names are in upper case (I selected NRF52).
8. Select the Apply button and then the Debug button

**Expected behaviour:**

The PyOCD GDB server starts and you are prompted to open the debug perspective (if not already open).

**Actual behaviour:**

A problem occurred message box is displayed stating that the pyOCD GDB server failed with code (2).  If you look at the GDB PyOCD Debugging console you see a usage message for PyOCD GDB server along with the error message: ""pyocd-gdbserver: error: argument -t/--target: invalid choice"" along with a list of valid choices all in lower case (including nrf52).

If the plugin is querying pyocd-gdbserver for supported targets (which it appears to do) it is somehow do a case conversion somewhere along the way that it shouldn't do.

### Versions

* GNU MCU C/C++ PyOCD Debugging Plug In Version 1.1.4.201707111115
* Eclipse Version 4.7.0.v2017061201800
* Java Version 1.8.0_131
* MacOS Version 10.12.6
* pyocd-gdbserver Version 0.8.1a1

The only issue I could find that is related to this is issue #82 - the fix for that issue seems to be in the code so I expect this is something different.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/225/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When the pyocd-gdbserver is requested to list available targets in JSON by the Eclipse plugin it returns two strings for each target, one in upper case (part_number) and one in lower case (name).  Here is an example:

```
$ pyocd-gdbserver --list-targets --json
{
    ""status"": 0, 
    ""version"": {
        ""major"": 1, 
        ""minor"": 0
    }, 
    ""pyocd_version"": ""0.8.1a1"", 
    ""targets"": [
        {
            ""part_number"": ""KL25Z"", 
            ""name"": ""kl25z""
        }, 
        {
            ""part_number"": ""KL26Z"", 
            ""name"": ""kl26z""

....
```
The plugin is currently using the part_number when building the list of supported targets, and then passes the selected part_number (in upper case) when invoking pyocd-gdbserver which then fails.  

A possible fix would be to change the plugin to use the name when building the list of supported targets instead of the part_number.

I'm not a Java person but here is a possible fix:

1. Install Eclipse Neon.3 from scratch
2. Try installing the GNU MCU plugins from the Marketplace
3. Try opening http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates in browser to verify it's not some IP blacklisting etc, should open fine

Global tools path preference for toolchain folder does not handle Windows network paths (with two leading backslashes) correctly.

My GNU ARM Eclipse tools are installed on a network location, let's call it \\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools. When adding this as toolchain folder under
Preferences -> C/C++ -> Build -> Global Tools Path -> Toolchain folder
(or setting ilg.gnuarmeclipse.managedbuild.cross/toolchain.path.1871385609)
I end up with this error message:
Error: Program ""aarch64-none-elf-g++"" not found in PATH
PATH=[[...some entries...];\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools;[...more entries...]]

It seems that the raw value of the preference is modified in some way before the PATH variable is extended causing the two leading backslashes to be merged into one, which results in an incorrect entry in the PATH variable.

I tried a few things to work around this issue but was unlucky so far:
\\\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools
\\\\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools
\\\\\\\\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools
//MyServer\gnu\cross-tools
\/MyServer\gnu\cross-tools
/\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools
All of the above result in ""\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools"" to end up in the PATH variable.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to Preferences -> C/C++ -> Build -> Global Tools Path -> Toolchain folder and set Toolchain path to \\MyServer\gnu\cross-tools
2. Try to build a CDT project
3. The build fails because the toolchain is not found in the PATH

**Expected behaviour:** The plugin should not merge two leading backslashes before extending the PATH variable.

**Actual behaviour:** The plugin incorrectly merges all leading backslashes of the Toolchain path value before extending the PATH variable.

This issue is still hitting us today.
I think I've located the problematic section in the code base:

https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/752ae80fe82e14770728ebd18626de9d183ca625/plugins/org.eclipse.embedcdt.managedbuild.cross.arm.core/src/org/eclipse/embedcdt/managedbuild/cross/arm/core/EnvironmentVariableSupplier.java#L158

Here, the `path` string is composed by joining multiple paths using the OS's path separator. Then, the string is passed to the new File(...) constructor.

When Windows UNC paths are involved, this will result in a calls like
`new File(""\\filer\path1;\\filer\path2"")`
When later converting this File object back to a string, the double backslash in the middle will have been replaced by a single backslash
`\\filer\path1;\\filer\path2 -> \\filer\path1;\filer\path2`
which causes the problems that we are observing.

I think the fix would be to either not use File but just use a String to pass to the PathEnvironmentVariable constructor or - if the path sanitizing is important for some flows - the path string would need to be split on the path separator character and each segment path be wrapped in a java.io.File object.

I can do this for my own interactive development flow, but I cannot control the setup for all users that use our tools together with the Embedded CDT plugin.

@ilg-ul to clarify again, I can provide an example of what is happening in our case. We are adding two settings in the plugin preferences to point to the following two locations
`\\somepath\gnu-arm-eclipse-build-tools\2.6-201507152002\bin`
`\\somepath\aarch64-none-elf-11.3.rel1\bin`
The code I was pointing to above is concatenating those two strings to effectively form
`path = ""\\somepath\gnu-arm-eclipse-build-tools\2.6-201507152002\bin;\\somepath\aarch64-none-elf-11.3.rel1\bin"";`
At this point, everything is still fine. Then, a `java.io.File` object is created from it
`File sysroot = new File(path);`
This is where things go wrong, as the windows implementation of java.io.File will ""optimize out"" the inner duplicate backslashes in the string representation. Note that it does correctly keep the two leading backslashes.

So the variable `path` actually contains a semicolon-separated list of file system paths, whereas the `java.io.File` class is meant to represent a single file system path.

With my (limited) understanding of the code base, I would propose the following fix.

1. The class PathEnvironmentVariable has a member `private File path;`. The only method that uses this member is the `getValue()` method, which returns a String by doing `path.getAbsolutePath()`. This is causing the original input string (with the semicolon-separated list of paths) to become corrupted.
2. This class can be changed to have a member `private String pathList;` instead. This member would be returned from the `getValue()` method.
3. The constructor would be changed to take a `List<File>` as argument. The `pathList` member can then be initialized by calling `getAbsolutePath()` on each element from the input list and joining all values with the OS's path separator.
4. The static factory method `PathEnvironmentVariable.create` would then be changed from constructing one long string to constructing a list of File objects from all the settings and pass that one to the constructor. Of course the logic described above could also be moved from the constructor to the static factory method instead.

I'll look into this a little, the fact that it works in all other cases (Linux, Windows with drive letters) is probably somewhat undefined behaviour as having a ""File"" store a non-single file/dir name is an error.

I did not check the documentation, but using `File()` to validate a composed path is most probably an error which must be fixed.

If your PR does this, and is portable to also work on macOS and Linux, it should be fine.

The plugin build instructions here are a little bit unclear and inconsistent:

https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/developer/build-procedure/
https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins

Specifically:

#1 - One set of instructions deals with a command line build while the other seems to be referring to using something (Eclipse?) to do the build. It might be helpful to document one or both build approaches more clearly?

#2 - https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/developer/build-procedure/

> The build result is in the ilg.gnumcueclipse.repository project
>
> the target/ilg.gnumcueclipse.repository-3.3.1-SNAPSHOT.zip file
> the target/repository folder, with the p2 update site

This is slightly out of date and a little confusing. It might be clearer if it was documented as something like:

`<build-root-folder>/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins.git/repositories`

And there are actually two sub-folders and zips - not one

```
<build-root-folder>/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins.git/repositories/ilg.gnumcueclipse.repository/target/ilg.gnumcueclipse.repository-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.zip
<build-root-folder>/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins.git/repositories/ilg.gnumcueclipse.riscv.repository/ilg.gnumcueclipse.riscv.repository-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.zip
```
I presume that these zips can be used with Eclipse's Add New Software > Archive option but it's not clear from the documentation.

And I have created the projects and debug launch configurations from scratch within this environment and have not imported them from any previous version of the tools.

I can't see anything obviously wrong with my debug launch configuration - I haven't changed much from the default settings other than to specify my specific OpenOCD options (--command ""set DEVICE M2S090"" --file board/microsemi-cortex-m3.cfg, disable the Pre-run/Restart reset because it does not suit our targets and saved the debug launch configuration in the local project rather than in the workspace.

Apologies but I DO change the openocd path setting from my plugin_customization.ini referenced by my eclipse.ini.
I set it as follows because I want to reference openocd relative to the eclipse installation.

`ilg.gnumcueclipse.debug.gdbjtag.openocd/install.folder=${eclipse_home}/../openocd/bin`

And I see this default override value appearing in the GUI under Window > Preferences > MCU > Global OpenOCD Path.

But it looks like using an eclipse variable (i.e. ""{eclipse_home}"") here causes problems even though this worked in previous versions of the GNU ARM Plugins.

If I change the setting to c:\Microsemi\SoftConsole_v5.2\openocd\bin then I no longer get the error.

Has the code changed in this support since the move from GNU ARM Eclipse to GNU MCU Eclipse?
If eclipse variable expansion is no longer working here at the moment would it be a big deal to (re)instate it?

-s ""${openocd_path}/../scripts""
but ${openocd_path} in it is resolved as empty string.
This trick worked on GNU ARM plugin (with String Subtitutions), but now in GNU MCU plugin with dynamic MCU variables doesn't work. Now only the full path to scripts works.
Any suggestion how to solve this problem?

In practice this has no obvious adverse impact as the earlier versions never appear in the Eclispe software installation dialogs.

But I just wondered if it was a small (innocuous) anomaly that there were second copies of each of the jar files?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/237/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The GNU RISC-V Cross Create Listing build step calls objdump to generate a list file including disassembly etc. By default the command line is:

`objdump --source --all-headers --demangle --line-numbers --wide ""riscv-systick-blinky.elf""`

However this has the effect of trying to disassemble data as well as code sections. 
In my case I'm compiling for -march=rv32im -mabi=ilp32 and yet I see this in the list file:

Note the disassembly of data at the end of the file from address 0x80001740 onwards which appears as if it was compressed code.

Now I'm not sure if this data is actually literal pool data in a code section so objdump may know no better than to try to disassemble it? Or if there are some options that the plugin list file generation build step could/should pass to avoid this happening?

my toolchain release includes the gcc manuals. in binutils.pdf there is a separate chapter for objdump, with lots of options, perhaps that would be a good place to start the search.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTg5MzY3Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/239,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/239,eclipse-plugins,259760526,239,Expand macros when checking folders in tools discovery,AntonKrug,30338596,Anton Krug,Anton.Krug@netapp.com,CLOSED,2017-09-22T09:45:39Z,2017-11-10T18:52:59Z,"### Description

When macro used in the path then the first path preference becomes the very last because the macro will not get resolved at all and it will fail every single time. Meaning that anything else will be taken rather than the specified path we want. And if I have the ARM toolchain present (or even a dummy file with that name) it will rather take that then the path we want.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install ARM toolchain belong side the eclipse install directory 

2. Create/Touch file under this path: 
C:/Program Files (x86)/GNU Tools ARM Embedded/6 2017-q2-update/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe 
To emulate that we installed official ARM toolchain as well.
 
3. Add this path with PluginCustomization to the eclipse and use the macro to reference eclipse's home directory:
ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross.arm/toolchain.path.1287942917=${eclipse_home}/../arm-none-eabi-gcc/bin

4. Right click on ARM project which does not have specific settings overridden from a default (the one which takes the global settings). And either got to MCU -> ARM Toolchains Paths, or to C/C ++ Build -> Settings -> Toolchains -> Toolchain path.

**Expected behaviour:** 
It should have used the ${eclipse_home}/../arm-none-eabi-gcc/bin

**Actual behaviour:** 
But actually it will contain the:
C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\6 2017-q2-update\bin

### Verbose info

When I modify this file:

/ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross.arm/src/ilg/gnumcueclipse/managedbuild/cross/arm/preferences/DefaultPreferenceInitializer.java


```
public void finalizeInitializationsDefaultPreferences() {

	if (Activator.getInstance().isDebugging()) {
		System.out.println(""arm.LateInitializer.finalizeInitializationsDefaultPreferences()"");
	}

	DefaultPreferences deprecatedDefaultPreferences = new DefaultPreferences(
			""ilg.gnuarmeclipse.managedbuild.cross"");

	// Toolchains paths
	for (ToolchainDefinition toolchain : ToolchainDefinition.getList()) {

		String toolchainName = toolchain.getName();

		// If the search path is known, discover toolchain.
		int ix;
		try {
			ix = ToolchainDefinition.findToolchainByName(toolchainName);
		} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
			ix = ToolchainDefinition.getDefault();
		}

		System.out.println(""------------------ "" + ix + "" - "" + toolchainName + "" --------------------------"");

		String executableName = ToolchainDefinition.getToolchain(ix).getFullCmdC();
		System.out.println(executableName);

		// Try the defaults from the GNU MCU Eclipse store.
		String path = fDefaultPreferences.getToolchainPath(toolchainName);
		System.out.println(""1-default-preference. Setting path to: "" + path);

		if (!fDefaultPreferences.checkFolderExecutable(path, executableName)) {
			// Try the deprecated GNU ARM Eclipse store.
			path = deprecatedDefaultPreferences.getToolchainPath(toolchainName);
			System.out.println(""2-deprecatedDefault, previous path was not found, overiding it with: "" + path);
		}

		if (!fDefaultPreferences.checkFolderExecutable(path, executableName)) {
			// Try the persistent preferences.
			path = fPersistentPreferences.getToolchainPath(toolchainName, null);
			System.out.println(""3-persistentPreferences, previous path was not found, overiding it with: "" + path);
		}

		if (!fDefaultPreferences.checkFolderExecutable(path, executableName)) {
			// If not defined elsewhere, discover.
			path = fDefaultPreferences.discoverToolchainPath(toolchainName, executableName);
			System.out.println(""4-discoverToolchainPath. previous path was not found, overiding it with: "" + path);
		}
		
		System.out.println();

		if (path != null && !path.isEmpty()) {
			// If the toolchain path was finally discovered, store
			// it in the default preferences.
			fDefaultPreferences.putToolchainPath(toolchainName, path);
		}

		if (Activator.getInstance().isDebugging()) {
			System.out.println(""arm.LateInitializer.finalizeInitializationsDefaultPreferences() done"");
		}
	}
}
```

And this file:
/ilg.gnumcueclipse.core/src/ilg/gnumcueclipse/core/preferences/DefaultPreferences.java

```
	public boolean checkFolderExecutable(String folder, String executableName) {

		if (folder == null || folder.isEmpty()) {
			return false;
		}
		if (executableName == null || executableName.isEmpty()) {
			return false;
		}

		if (EclipseUtils.isWindows()) {
			executableName = addExeExtension(executableName);
		}

		IPath path = (new Path(folder)).append(executableName);
		
		System.out.println(""Testing if this exists: "" + path.toString());
		
		if (path.toFile().isFile()) {
			return true;
		}

		return false;
	}
```

Adding more printouts will show me the logic how it tries to evaluate the path:

> ------------------ 0 - GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors --------------------------
> arm-none-eabi-gcc
> 1-default-preference. Setting path to: ${eclipse_home}/../arm-none-eabi-gcc/bin

> 4-discoverToolchainPath. previous path was not found, overiding it with: C:/Program Files (x86)/GNU Tools ARM Embedded/6 2017-q2-update/bin
> 


I think the similar situation applies to the RISC-V bundle as well.

The [Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki) - is both a piece of hardware, and a somewhat-portable firmware (can flash it to ST-Link and some other devices) that implements an SWD and JTAG probe for Cortex-M (and some Cortex-A), and internally implements the GDB server, so that the serial port it exposes to the system can be directly connected to with `target extended-remote \\.\com31` or your platform's variant - see <https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki/Useful-GDB-commands> for high performance and simple usage. It also supports SWO.

A plugin would be useful for a few reasons. One would be auto-selection of serial ports: the CDC-ACM device exposed, since it can be determined from the USB interface number. Another, naturally, would be the same sort of easy configuration of the stuff that usually goes in a GDB init script. The other, would just be getting it to work in modern Eclipse...

I've tried the built-in ""GDB Hardware Debugging"" plugin (in the latest gnu-mcu-eclipse download - a Neon.3 build) but I'm getting MI errors that suggest it's trying to connect with just the equivalent of `remote` instead of `extended remote`. From what I've been able to search, it seems like recent versions of eclipse updated debugging frameworks to DSF and since there is no ""standard"" alternate plugin left around, there's apparently no way to configure it from the Eclipse GUI; even though, e.g., Visual Studio Code GDB plugin works just as well with it as with the J-Link, with just a different init script. At this point, I'm out of my league in Eclipse, so I'm filing a bug/request as a way of throwing my hands up - the BMP works great if I'm willing to do it all in the terminal, otherwise I basically have to use a nucleo-jlink.

Thanks! The startup tab worked for me so I placed my commands in there

My gdb command is simply ""arm-none-eabi-gdb"" without the -ex options.

under Startup tab:
uncheck ""Reset and Delay"" and ""Halt""
place any commands in the text field below. i.e.:
```
target extended-remote COM8
monitor connect_srst enable
monitor swdp_scan
attach 1
```
then you can play around with the other options and write more commands under the Run Commands text field.

Finally, its working well now. After attaching, the target is not reset and this is intended behaviour. In the 'Run Commands' listbox I added a 'run' or 'start' (for stopping at main()' and now debugging starts as wanted.
@ilg-ul +1 for a simple BMP plugIn with enumeration of USB or serial devices to detect one or more BMP. The configuration is much easier than for OOCD. It is very common for all targets because the probe detects the targets and does not need different config files.

What seems to happen is, at random, when a single-step completes and Eclipse queries the server for state information, once-in-a-while Eclipse locks up and fails to update.  This is using:

- macOS High Sierra 10.13.3
- Eclipse OXYGEN.3 Release (4.7.3), build id: 20180308-1800
- GNU MCU ARM plug-ins (all dated 201801250917)

I thought I'd see if I could replicate the problem in a Windows 7 VM with an older version of Eclipse (MARS.2), but got stuck at another problem before I ever tried to run in Eclipse.  Using arm-none-eabi-gdb from terminal, just attempting to connect to the black magic probe (target extended-remote \\\\.\COM20) issues a ""warning: SetCommState failed"" and gdb hangs--outside of Eclipse.

Anyway, I've run out of time for a while to look into this further.  If and when I find out anything more that may be helpful to others I'll provide an update.

[cosmetic issue]
When a required field is left empty it returns a cryptic error message. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Setup generic project with the OpenOCD luncher.
2. Opening a debug launcher settings and deleting content from:
Debugger -> OpenOCD Setup -> Telnet port 
will cause getting a strange error dialog:

**Expected behaviour:**
Less cryptic error description or not allowing the user to put an empty string on a required field (instead of an InputStringField use NumberTextField, if that would help). 

**Actual behaviour:** 
""Update LCD"" has encountered a problem.
An internal error has occurred.
An internal error has occurred.

However, when I export my mbed project and import into my Eclipse workspace, I don't have an include path for the standard includes. I'm not familiar enough with CDT to know whether this is because the mbed CLI should be including entries in the `.cproject` corresponding to the `GCC_ARM_HOME` or because CDT should be importing ""standard"" includes from another provider.

I did not run through the qemu tutorial because I'm using mbed instead of the CMSIS Pack system. I exported/imported a basic mbed blinky program and got it working on a development board and only ran into trouble when I tried to import `<stdint.h>` for `uint8_t`.

Yes, the folders show up, but I also get hundreds of thousands of errors on the mbed codebase. (At least a lot of them seem to be justified, but seeing that is why I wasn't sure that checking the box was the correct solution.)

They are being autodiscovered by eclipse by calling the compiler with a special set of switches. The result is fed into the indexer, which seems to work reasonably well, and captures both the macros predefined by the toolset, and those supplied on the command line by the build tool.

The CMake eclipse generator can't yet generate projects with multiple configurations. You effectively have to generate multiple different out-of-source builds for what you would normally use different configurations (Debug or Release...). I consider this a major drawback of the current CMake eclipse generator. The generator for Microsoft Visual Studio does not have that limitation.

I still experiment with CMake and the various ways how you can set up projects, targets, etc. to see what the consequences are for the resulting eclipse project. The fact, however, that you configure a project programmatically through the CMakeLists.txt files as opposed to clicking your way through complicated properties dialogs is a big adavntage IMHO.

Furthermore, the combination of eclipse and ninja is very effective in figuring out exactly what files need to be rebuilt. The eclipse makefile generator ends up recompiling the entire project much too often for my taste. If you have a larger project with a lot of C++, a full rebuild takes considerable time.

You can also generate for ninja alone, which makes for a very effective build server. That's much more elegant than having to install eclipse just to use it from the command line.

There's a related question (not sure if it warrants a separate issue): I notice that the NVIC, and a couple of other CPU-related register sets, are missing from the register display.

Actually, since the NVIC and other CPU-specific peripherals are attached to the CPU, it might be better to list them in the Registers view instead of the Peripherals view. Currently, there's only the ""General Registers"" entry in the Registers view for ARM Cortex M CPUs. I would find it best to have more entries for the CPU-specific periperals like the NVIC there.

The advantage would be apparent in multi-CPU chips, where each CPU has its own NVIC, and can't see the NVICs of the other CPUs. See the LPC43xx series for an example.

aha. I did not check the sources, but as far as I know the group name ""General Registers"" and the list of register names come from the GDB, which get them from the GDB server. 

GDB knows the notion of register groups, but the MI protocol used to talk to the GDB server does not.

in theory it might be possible to reimplement completely the Registers tab, and include some of the peripherals, but that would not be easy.

But that's probably me being naive, as I'm completely unfamiliar with the eclipse code (I have no experience in Java coding, either).

Of course, if GDB and MI supported groups properly, it would be possible to have integer and floating point registers in different groups, but that would be icing on the cake.

Anyway, you get the idea. If the Registers tab is too difficult, adding the CPU peripherals to the Periperals tab would also be an option, but the problem here is that depending on the type of CPU core being debugged, it would need to change.

yes, that would be the natural option. unfortunately ARM and the MCU vendors did not agree on the details. the content of the Peripherals tab comes from the MCU vendor SVD files. ARM specs were not clear enough, some vendors add system registers to the SVD file, others do not.

on the other hand it should be noted that NVIC has not really a common definition, it is implementation specific (the number of bits in the priority, the number of interrupts, etc).

After some trial and error, it looks like it isn't an issue with install at all.
It might have to do with my workflow.

I do not use Eclipse to build/develop applications (so I don't create/import projects)
I just create a standalone debug configuration, load an elf, specify the board to OpenOCD and start debugging.
![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25658888/39579193-a59b1cf8-4ed5-11e8-8c8f-12eb43624d65.PNG)

-------------------------------------------------------
This time I tried creating (just as an experiment) a new project. Now when I generate a debug configuration associated with this project, the 'Actual Executable' field does indeed populate appropriately and everything works just fine !
![capture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25658888/39579044-4d866b30-4ed5-11e8-85b7-e4ca267d1cdf.PNG)

I am familiar with the approach to 'import' an elf and create a (non-buildable) project to debug the exec.
So I tried this and it worked as well.

In essence, it looks like a debug config now needs to be associated with a project. 
Is this expected ?
Should I switch to *always* creating projects with the new plugin ?

well, a debug config does not **need** to be associated with a project.

you can always browse for the absolute address of the binaries.

however, the defaults used to create the debug config expect a project, since expanding the macos require a project.

but, as I said, you can always override the defaults with any setting you want.

The GDB OpenOCD Debugging plugin allows the OpenOCD GDB (Remote Serial Protocol) and Telnet ports to be configured (defaulting to 3333 and 4444 respectively). 
OpenOCD also creates/uses a Tcl port which defaults to 6666.
In (possibly rare?) cases where somebody wants to run simultaneous OpenOCD sessions using separate JTAG and target hardware they need to configure the ""second"" session to use different GDB, Telnet and Tcl ports (e.g. 3334, 4445 and 6667).
Since there is no way to configure the Tcl port in the GUI a second OpenOCD debug session will probably fail unless --command ""tcl_port 6667"" is passed to OpenOCD - e.g.

--command ""tcl_port 6667"" --file board/myboard.cfg

As I told you, my environment has several languages ​​installed and my Eclipse is a babel, Eclipse Oxygen seems to be much more stable in this simultaneous use, I am very satisfied and the GNU MCU Eclipse is working very well even with the Nordic nRF5x line .

I Use Eclipse for JavaScript and Web Developers for development with NativeScript a framework for Mobile multi platform Development and integration with bluetooth.

I noticed an interesting fact, the ""MCU"" configuration menu in the project properties is appearing in projects that are not connected to MCU (CDT Projects), this only happens with the GNU Eclipse MCU plugin.

For example if I create a JavaScript project, it should only appear the options related to the JavaScript compilation and assembly tools, but the MCU menu appears there too. Is this a setting that I can intervene with or just with a setting in the plugin code? 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use Eclipse Oxygen with JavaScript plugin (Eclipse for JavaScript and Web Developers)
2. Instal CDT and GNU MCU Eclipse Plugin
3. Create a JavaScript Project
4. Open de Project Property, you see MCU menu.

It should not appear, as the CDT options do not appear.

Apart from that thanks for the warning, that pretty much eliminates the FPGA option for me. I will have to wait a month for my HiFive1. In the mean time, I will try to write some code in GNU MCU Eclipse. And thanks for the name change (GNU MCU Eclipse): that's what made me realize the existence of RISC-V.

* clang has [clangd ](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html) or a supposedly more complete language server implementation [cquery](https://github.com/jacobdufault/cquery)
* Both the cloud IDEs I've evaluatied (Che and C9.io) are naturally focused on ""non-cross-compile"" and ""non-remote debug scenarios""
* Ideal debug solution would be a debug server hooked to the target board/boards and Che connecting to the server

The IDE doesn't need to be browser based Che can serve workspaces to standard eclipse as well.

I think it would be extremely useful for embedded development considering building an embedded dev environment is so tedious and learning how to build an embedded dev environment is even more tedious. (Though lately this has become somewhat easier due to your efforts in particular)

When working as a team on embedded projects I'd much prefer setting up my workspace on a server somewhere and then just handing my peers a single link which will allow them to start developing immediately. 
This is versus directing them to the gnu-mcu-eclipse documentation and hoping they make it through okay or giving them a copy of my dev virtual machine which goes immediately out of sync with my copy as soon as they start updating packages and install their preferred tools.

Also, If you haven't been monitoring the [Language Server Protocol](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/april/article5.php) i'd take a look at that too.

If one uses variables in the GDB Run/Restart Commands in a launch config, Eclipse will deadlock between the GNU MCU Eclipse thread and the main thread when trying to resolve the variables.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a debug launch config (pyOCD in my case).
2. Add a variable to the GDB Run/Restart Commands, such as `${project_loc}`. The exact command I used was:
```
add-symbol-file ${project_loc}/../bootloader_gcc_k22fa12/Debug/bootloader_gcc_k22fa12.elf 0x00000000
```
3. Save the launch config and launch it.

**Expected behaviour:**

Launch config launches successfully and GDB executes the start commands with resolved variables.

**Actual behaviour:**

Eclipse hangs with the above described deadlock.

If you do not use variables in the Run/Restart command, then the launch config launches without any problems.

### Versions

I'm testing a **STM32 NUCLEO F767ZI** board through a **Ubuntu Linux** host. And, I'm using **Eclipse 4.7.2** + **gnu-mcu-eclipse** . Actually, my code is just the default blinky project, so, it's NOT hard to create the project and successfully build it.

However, whenever I tried to debug/run it, I always met the following error message:


```
SEGGER J-Link GDB Server V6.22d - Terminal output channel
assert_param() failed: file ""../system/src/stm32f7-hal/stm32f7xx_hal_rcc_ex.c"", line 1256
abort(), exiting...
Connection closed by the GDB server.
```

**line 1256** of file **stm32f7xx_hal_rcc_ex.c** is:
```
assert_param(IS_RCC_PLLR_VALUE(RCC_OscInitStruct->PLL.PLLR));
```

In the corresponding header file **stm32f7xx_hal_rcc_ex.h**, there is a definition about **PLL>PLLR**: 
```
#if defined (STM32F765xx) || defined (STM32F767xx) || defined (STM32F769xx) || defined (STM32F777xx) || defined (STM32F779xx)
  uint32_t PLLR;       /*!< PLLR: Division factor for DSI clock.
                            This parameter must be a number between Min_Data = 2 and Max_Data = 7    */
#endif /* STM32F767xx || STM32F769xx || STM32F777xx || STM32F779xx */  
```

I then tried to add
**#define STM32F767xx 1**
in front of everything in **main.c**, I still get this error message.


For me, it's just because the Macro **STM32F767xx** has **NEVER** been defined.

Can anybody give me a hand ?

Thank you very much

Pei

Thank you so much for your prompt reply... I do have the symbol **STM32F767xx** defined in Project **Properties** ~ **Settings** ~ **Cross ARM GNU C Compiler** ~ **Preprocessor**.

I NOW think your **FIRST** reply might be the correct answer: F4 Blinky is guaranteed to run, but F7 Blinky is **NOT** ??? There might be a bug in **GNU MCU Ecipse STM32F7** template ??

What I've done is just 
**File** ~ **New** ~ **C/C++ Project** ~ **C Managed Build** ~ **Executable STM32F7xx C/C++ Project  + CROSS ARM GCC** (Type in Project Name: F767ZI_1 ) ~ **Chip family STM32F767xx, Flash Size(kB) 2048, External clock (Hz) 8000000** , Then, **Next** ~ **Next** ~ **Next**...

Finally, select **Cross GNU ARM Toolchina**, which is directly downloaded from [ARM Official Website](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads), the **NEWEST** version
**gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major Linux 64-bit** .

Afterwards, **Finish**.


After that, right click **F767ZI_1** ~ **Run AS/Debug As** ~ **Run Configuration/Debug Configuration** ~ **GDB SEGGER J-Link Debugging** ~ **New** (Automatically generate a Name **F767ZI_1 Debug**) ~in Tab **Debugger** make sure the Device name **STM32F767ZI**. 

Finally, click **Run** or **Debug**.


That's how I generate the code... **Build Project** successfully. But, **Run** or **Debug** generate this **ERROR** message:

> SEGGER J-Link GDB Server V6.22d - Terminal output channel
> assert_param() failed: file ""../system/src/stm32f7-hal/stm32f7xx_hal_rcc_ex.c"", line 1256
> abort(), exiting...


Looking forward to your suggestions...

That's great ilg-uI. Thank you vey much for your prompt patch...
The code now reports **NO** bug, but with the following output:

```

However, I didn't see any LED on NUCLEO STM32F767ZI blinking... But, the LED on SEGGER J-Link seems to be blinking... Is that the expected result? (Sorry for my naive question.)


BTW, is there any camera exsample (for example, ov5640) for me to follow?

I'm afraid there is a misunderstanding; all templates create generic projects, and since the wizard did not ask for the board name, it does not know that you want to use that specific NUCLEO board.

Please check the `BlinkLed.h` and update the pin where the LED is connected to match your board.

`-march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32e`

Do the plugins need to be changed to remove -march=rv32e and add -mabi=ilp32e?

On the other hand I'm not sure how set in stone the rv32e support, the current implementation in the tools and the way of telling the tools to target rv32e are given that I don't think that the abi is full specified and/or ratified as this suggests?

According to Jim here:

the latest on this is that one can use:

So in terms of the plugin and the latest tools the arch list is correct but the -mabi=ilp32e option is missing.

I'm not sure which, if any, version of the tools supports this though.
Certainly not the last release: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases/tag/v20171231
With that I get:

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc: error: unrecognized argument in option '-mabi=ilp32e'
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc: note: valid arguments to '-mabi=' are: ilp32 ilp32d ilp32f lp64 lp64d lp64f; did you mean 'ilp32'?

But I guess that's not your problem once the plugin lists the option?

Edit: oh - just reviewed this again and I see that the changes for rv32e are on the riscv-next branch:

Hi, I created a **NEW** **BlinkLed** project, which is built successfully, with **NO** **ERROR** message. However, if I move these two files **BlinkLed.h** and **BlinkLed.c** into an independent folder named **BlinkLed**, and modify **main.c** accordingly to ensure the correct **PATH** of file **BlinkLed.h**. Afterwards, I **Build Project**, almost successful, but with an **ERROR** message 
` undefined reference to `blink_led_init'`

I wonder if I use this **GNU-MCU-Eclipse** plugin, will the project look on any created folder as a single library? I  mean, for instance, in my case above, will the Eclipse project build the folder **BlinkLed** with two files **BlinkLed.h** and **BlinkLed.c** into a library for the **main.c** to link finally? Otherwise, why there is an **ERROR** message **undefined reference** ?

Hi, @ilg-ul 


Now, every single file is successfully compiled, but the project failed to build, with a lot of **undefined reference to** **ERROR** messages. In fact, some file calls, for example, **HAL_DMA_Init()** function, which is declared/defined in file **system/include/stm32f7-hal/stm32f7xx_hal.dma.h**.

Peripherals view is empty as described in https://www.element14.com/community/thread/62731/l/peripherals-view-empty-with-stm32f407

### Steps to Reproduce

1) Install pack 2.11.0 from STM32F4xx_DFP from keil.com
2) assign STM32F407VG as device in the project properties,
3) enter debug perspective
4) open Peripherals view 

**Expected behaviour:** [What you expected to happen]

In the peripherals view there should be a list of peripheral registers of STM32F407VG

**Actual behaviour:** [What actually happened]

No registers visible  in the list - list empty

No actions after the message:

Parsing SVD file ""/home/xxx/Packages/NordicSemiconductor/nRF_DeviceFamilyPack/8.15.2/SVD/nrf52.svd""...

No message about successful parse ""on xx ms"" appear.
""Peripherals"" view is empty on debugging session.
Regular core registers are visible through ""Registers"" view.
Device selected ""Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Devices->nRF52_Series->nRF52832_xxAA""
I'm suggesting this is a *.svd plug-in parser issue or not supported SVD file format from Nordic.
P.S. Segger Ozone debugger works fine with the exact *.svd file. All the peripheral registers are visible there.

A project which has to target 2 platforms shows strange behaviour when switching configurations.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Import to RISCV project a configuration from ARM project so you could be targeting both platforms by quickly switching.
2. In project settings now the RISCV is showing as RISCV.
3. By clicking on the top to switch configuration, now I can switch to ARM and the layout updates,
4. Switching back to RISCV project will still keep the ARM layout and not update to RISCV.

**Expected behaviour:** 

Switching between configuration should always update to the corresponding target,

**Actual behaviour:**

RISCV Configuration:

ARM configuration:

Switch back to RISCV will still keep ARM layout:

I tried with the latest version of the plug-ins and also with an older version.

I creted a new RISC-V project and imported the Debug configuration from an ARM project, saved the new configuration and then entered again in the Properties windows. Switching from ARM to RISC-V and back works as expected.

I think the step to save everything after adding the new configuration is mandatory, otherwise Eclipse might not be aware of the new configuration.

Making RISCV project and using the tune option ""generic"" with a new riscv gcc will cause this error on compile time:
""cc1.exe: error: unknown cpu 'generic' for -mtune""
On another hand there is the ""size"" tune option which is not available from the menu:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/blob/riscv-gcc-7.2.0/gcc/config/riscv/riscv.c#L339

If the -mtune generic worked in the past then plugin should probably detect the toolchain version and give it valid options to select depending on the toolchain version. 

Or give the user all possible options from all version ""rocket/generic/size"" and leave it to the user to know which one is usable. But with new gcc toolchain, in essence, there is no option now, only to use rocket, which allows misaligned memory access. This option expects the trap handler to handle that memory access, if that handler is not meant to handle such requests then the code will crash on runtime.

The blog makes it sound less harmful than it really can be:

https://www.sifive.com/blog/2017/08/14/all-aboard-part-1-compiler-args/

""The last compiler argument that’s involved in specifying a target is the simplest of the bunch. While the -march argument can cause systems to be unable to execute code and the -mabi argument can cause objects to be incompatible with each other, the -mtune argument should only change the performance of the generated code. As it currently stands we really don’t have any tuning models for RISC-V systems. Unless you’ve just added a new tuning parameter to our GCC port, you probably shouldn’t bother doing anything with this argument.""

If I understand it correctly there is a desire to use the mtune to control the aligned access when the mstrict-align is not present:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/pull/73

Or should the mstrict-align be present as a separate option in the menu?

For something which is not as clearly accessible from the UI the  ""allow non-aligned access"" can have a pretty big impact on some specific implementations.

Users might be affected without realizing it and problems occurring only when some optimizations enabled (debug working, release crashing -> and release much harder to debug/spot the cause).

The closest issue I found was [this](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/5). I'd like to configure the Tool Settings for specifying the Target Processor in imported Makefile projects (In the previous issue they were referred to as Unmanaged Projects). 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. File->Import->C/C++->Existing Code as Makefile Project
2. Configure Project 
3. C/C++ Build->Settings->Tool Settings tab not available.

**Expected behaviour:** [What you expected to happen]

To be able to configure Tool Settings Target Processor even for unmanaged projects.

**Actual behaviour:** [What actually happened]

Tool Settings can only be enabled if I enable ""Generate Makefiles automatically"" in C/C++ Build dialog ""Builder Settings"" tab. Enabling this feature will cause [this project](https://github.com/tcwan/ev3dev-c) build to fail since the project contains subprojects which should not be rebuilt except under specific conditions.

### Versions

* GNU MCU Eclipse 4.3.2
* Eclipse CDT Oxygen.2
* JDK 9
* macOS High Sierra
* Docker-based Debian Stretch cross-toolchain `arm-linux-gnueabi-*` (requires Eclipse Docker Tooling and [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ev3dev/debian-stretch-cross/)

The naming is confusing and what you are referring to is out of @ilg-ul control.
Let me explain how I see the situation at hand. 

There are 2 builders (stuff that convert code in executables) in CDT

1. Managed build->CDT manages the build for you
2. Unmanaged builds->Someone manages a makefile to build (probably you)

Next to these builders runs the **Indexer**. The indexer takes care of plenty of the gui related stuff and in my eyes makes CDT. 

Even though the indexer is so vital for CDT most people do not realize it's existence (read CDT did a great integration job). Once you bump into ""proof of the indexer existence"" it is often quite hard to ""get it"" 

The ""proof of existence"" you bumped into is the ""indexer configuration"". Let me explain:

To work properly the indexer needs to know compiler defined defines and include paths. This info is defined in the compiler and not in ar, make, size.
In managed build the indexer asks the location and name of the compiler to the managed build engine.
In unmanaged build the indexer asks the user. As only the compiler is needed (not  ar, make, size) only the  compiler is requested.

nope. the paths should be initialised to reasonable defaults.

in general, if you install the binaries in known locations, the most recent one will be selected for the default path.

on Windows, in previous versions, installing via setup left several keys in the Registry, and the plug-ins use them in the search.

did you install the old Build Tools v2.8 via the setup?

  eclipse.preferences.version=1
  toolchain.path.962691777=${GCC_ARM_7_Q4}
It works but when we are in Project\Properties\MCU we can't leave the window.

The main reason to use System Paths is due the lack of tools in our CI machine.

`xpm` is a command line tool, you can use it on any CI.

The link below shows a sequence of test builds for one of my projects:

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ilg-ul/sifive-templates-xpack

What happens there is to crete projects by instantiating a template, satisfying dependencies and building the project (both debug & release).

I run similar builds on Travis.

What I did that seemed to fix the problem for me was to download the JDK (10.0.01).  I had been downloading just the JRE.  Then I ran this command and got this result:

Rays-MacBook-Pro:~ Ray$ /usr/libexec/java_home --verbose
Matching Java Virtual Machines (3):
    10.0.1, x86_64:	""Java SE 10.0.1""	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-10.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home
    1.6.0_65-b14-468, x86_64:	""Java SE 6""	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
    1.6.0_65-b14-468, i386:	""Java SE 6""	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home

/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-10.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home

So, the 1.6 had been lurking around and was creating the problem, but installing the JDK seemed to get things back on track.  If others see a similar problem, maybe have them use the command above to see what the system is seeing.

Thanks for the help!

All the best,
Ray

Being able to select a Chip for my Project (this worked some versions ago),
or even being able to select the chip during debugging (like for example this plugin manages to to this without all the drama: http://embsysregview.sourceforge.net/)

In short, the packs plugin being usable standalone without requiring some builder/toolchain plugins or special settings. And ideally without a specific debugger plugin aswell 

**Actual behaviour:**

Since a couple versions it appears that you have to choose
`ARM Cross GCC` to be able to specify the Board/Device, you need to install another MCU plugin to be even able to choose this option.

If the GNU MCU RISC5 or GNU MCU ARM Toolchain plugins are not installed you get a ton of errors like this:

yes, but this is a bit tricky, since it should depend on **either** the ARM build plug-in **or** the RISC-V build plug-in, which is a complex condition, and I'm afraid it is not possible to define it.

I agree with you that the current solution is not ideal; I'll leave this issue open, if I can find a better solution, I'll implement it.

That would allow to seperate
-   injecting the chip information
-   debugging an ELF File with fitting Information (even a standalone firmware without project!)

eg, the toolchain/project would do something similar to this (can be done with linker-commands awell, just dont have them ready):
```cpp
#define DEFINE_GDB_CHIPTYPE(chipspec) \
  __asm__(""\
.pushsection \"".debug_gdb_chiptype\"", \""MS\"",@progbits,1\n\
.byte 1 /* Version */\n\
.asciz \"""" chipspec ""\""\n\
.popsection \n\
"");

DEFINE_GDB_CHIPTYPE( ""STM32F303CB\0"" ""STM32F303\0"" )
```

the debugger plugin would read the section and try to find fitting device descriptions, configuring the peripherial view","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzgyOTAxNQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

eclipse would have to extract the infos from ELF section and setup the debugger/peripherial view. I have no idea how easy or complex this would be to implement.

**2-** There is a General Register section in Registers view but I guess this comes from query from openOCD not some address from memory of MCU.
**3-** Anyway, How can I make the Value field fixed width hex? I can select different formats but **fixed 32-bit hex** is not among them.

But anyway ...

#1 and #2 don't make sense to me. General registers are not peripherals and are not memory mapped so they have to be read (e.g. by OpenOCD) from the CPU and not from the memory map. CDT provides a ""general""  CPU registers view which displays the relevant RISC-V integer, floating point and CSR regs so that's where you find them. 

My recollection is that Eclipse/CDT is very quirky (and possibly buggy) when it comes to remembering size/format settings for the likes of registers so if you can't configure this so that it persists then it's more likely to be an Eclipse/CDT rather than a GNU MCU Eclipse plugin bug/issue and should be logged there not here.

You are right. For a moment, I thought this MCU had FPU and I wondered ""where are other registers?"" but it doesn't have FPU. And the fact that register names were lower-case made me doubt that there might be some other view for General Registers :D

However, about the fixed-width issue, TI's CCS is based on Eclipse. For example here is a debug view [(https://youtu.be/3ha72Y8pyD4?t=404)](https://youtu.be/3ha72Y8pyD4?t=404) of a CCS session. As you can see, Core Register values are fixed width and there are shown alongside other peripherals.

The truth is that the CDT debug plug-ins are a big concern, since any improvement in the way they work or the way they interract with the user, generally requires major rewrites, and most commercial products had to take this path.

Peripherals view is empty as described in 
https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/278

**Steps to Reproduce**
Install packs as explained in normal pack installation. I am not sure where the nRF pack comes from
but the GNU ARM C/C++ Packs version is 2.2.2.20170425
assign nRF52840 as device in the project properties,
enter debug perspective
open Peripherals view
Expected behaviour: [What you expected to happen]

In the peripherals view there should be a list of peripheral registers of nRF52840. 

Actual behaviour: [What actually happened]

No registers visible in the list - list empty. There is none and a red warning appears on the bottom of the IDE noting: 'Assign a device to the project'

**Versions**
[plug-in version]
4.3.3.20180419

[Eclipse version]
Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a)

[Java version]
1.8.0_171-b11

[operating system]
Windows 10

[toolchain version]
gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major

I also tried @PheeL79 workaround from #286  by editing the nRF52840.svd file and removing the BOM character and saving the file with UTF-8 and still did not get it to work.

you have a distribution with the Eclipse CDT & plug-ins already installed, all you have to do is unpack it to a different folder and use it. be sure you also create a new workspace, in a different folder than before, since this will createa a new Packages folder. 

alternatively you can simply remove the Packages folder, restart Eclipse and install the packs again.

I tried doing what you suggested and remove the packages folder and re-install the packs again. 
The problem still persists. 

What I noticed is that although I assign a device to the project, when I open up the debug configuration, the project name and application are filled automatically but the device name is NOT. 

For some reason although the project has an assigned device this is not 'seen' by the debugger (?)

If this means anything I have 64-bit windows but installed the 32-bit Eclipse distribution because the 64-bit didn't work. 

I'll try re-installing the whole distribution from scratch and test both 32 and 64 bit.

Any comments on the above are welcome.

It runs fine with the new java engine. 

The packages are pre-installed and I also installed the nRF_DeviceFamilyPack as per instructions from Nordic.

I don't think so - Makefile projects and (GNU or bog standard CDT) Managed Make projects are completely different types of project.

And isn't your question (ultimately about having the target device associated with a Makefile project) the same as the question asked here - to which the answer seems to be ""no""?

Issue #284 is probably what is happening here. 
I based my tool deployment to an older NORDIC's tutorial (https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/b/getting-started/posts/development-with-gcc-and-eclipse)
in which it was possible to assign a device to unmanaged builds and use NORDIC's own makefiles. This was back using eclipse MARS2.

I guess this is not the case now. 

Does that mean that I should include in my project all the related source folders and include folder? Do I need to add them as virtual folders and virtual links or I should copy the actual files into my project?

I tried making a managed version of a NORDIC example (blinky) and it fails because it cannot see an include file. How and where do I define the include path?

Thank you very much for your help.

Depends on what you want to do. If you want to create a Managed Make version of the original Makefile based projects (so that you can use CDT/GME plugin features) then you will need to have the relevant sources and includes in your project. Whether you make copies or ""link"" to them elsewhere is up to you I guess?

>  How and where do I define the include path?

Project > Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings > Cross ARM GNU C Assembler/C/C++ Compiler > Includes

Since you are asking a basic question like this I would encourage you to first familiarise yourself with the options available via the GME plugins - particularly the Tool Settings for the different compilation tools (project, assembler, C/C++, linker etc.).

You're right. It works when written as 2nd statement. Nevertheless I'll use the other option because I already start Eclipse with a bash script. Then I'll only have to consider one file.

Well, it is hard to tell for sure, but yes, Eclipse has lots of known problems, and some of them are related to rendering certain widgets on Linux. The Linux toolchain settings pages are relatively simple, and were obviously tested by the Eclipse CDT team thoroughly. The GME settings pages have more widgets, and apparently rendering them on Linux is problematic. 

The bad news is that there are little chances for this to be fixed any time soon; there are hundreds of Eclipse bugs in bugzilla and very few developers to address them.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTYwNzgwMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That was not made clear in your original post but it still doesn't necessarily indicate a GME plugin problem. It could be how your are compiling your program, your jlink configuration etc.

Anyway, as Liviu says, the forum is the correct place to discuss this...

I stand to be corrected, but I think adding AVR support should not be to difficult (although adding extra variability is always extra work) 
In essence the AVR tool-chain is just an other gcc based tool-chain, with potentially some different options to choose, all of which should be able to define in 'configuration' files.

did you try the Eclipse Arduino plug-ins?

> I think adding AVR support should not be to difficult

adding a build plug-in for AVR would not be very difficult, I already did a similar step when adding support for RISC-V.

however, full support would also include a multi-platform AVR toolchain, with the automated distribution mechanism similar to the one used for ARM and RISC-V toolchains.

I currently have no idea how difficult is to put together all the pieces required to build such a toolchain; to be clear, I have the scripts to build a multi-platform toolchain (see the ARM build script), I just don't know where to get the AVR pieces.

if you figure this out, and you are not happy with the Arduino plug-ins, we may consider the AVR build plug-ins.

aha. based on GCC 5.x. not exactly new. I hope the files provided by Atmel are enough to rebuild the toolchain, since I saw references to other distributions, which might suggest the opposite.

As I said, a build plug-in would probably not be very difficult to write, but I guess you'll also need to import projects from the old AVR plug-in, the tools to program flash, to run the simulator, the toolchain, and so on, and all those together might take some time. 

I'll think on them, but for now I cannot commit any resources to this, and I doubt there will be someone willing to support the development, so it'll have low priority for a while.

Are you of the opinion that eclipse+cdt+sloeber would be a good fit to continue the development of our existing AVR based products. Due to legacy we would need to be able to have multiple AVR tool-chains, and preferably select them on a project-build-target basis. Per project one main tool-chain could be used for auto-completion etc.

This is a good question. 

If the Arduino plug-ins can also be used for generic AVR projects, including flashing and debugging, a documentation page explaining how to do it would be very useful.

But when I say 'generic AVR projects' I mean it, i.e. no Arduino libraries or other specifics, plain C/C++ code.

If you do not use the arduino framework (cores and arduino libraries) you are ""dragging"" these Sloeber core functionalities along.
So from that point of view it does not make sense to use Sloeber.
However to support Arduino IDE functionality Sloeber extends CDT in ways which are of interest to you. Such as:
Sloeber supports easy installing of toolchains based on the ""arduino framework"" component called package.
Sloeber supports multiple versions of the same package (as such supporting ""versions of toolchains"")
Sloeber supports multiple configurations each with their own package (as such different toolchains per configuration)

Note that Sloeber 
-does not support ""debugging"". The Sloeber product includes some debugging components of gnu-mcu-eclipse of @ilg-ul  for a nice user experience.
As far as I'm aware you can run gnu-mcu-eclipse, avr-eclipse and Sloeber in the same eclipse instance without problems.
-is completely agnostic to the toolchain. Sloeber gets the toolchain commands from the ""platform.txt"" and feeds them to CDT. 

In short I think using Sloeber in your case might be like using a coin as a screw driver. The coin was never intended to be used that way but in some conditions it is a perfect fit.
I think the main deciding factor for you will be ""the of the shelf availability of toolchains in the current arduino framework ecosystem"" and your willingness to learn part of the arduino framework (you will very likely need to modify platform.txt files).

PS Your usage of Sloeber is so specific that it is very unlikely you will succeed without me ""guiding"". So if you try it, give me a shout for some tips.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTIzOTUzNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the project is definitely feasible, but... I currently cannot dedicate any resources to it. :-(

as a workaround, did you try to use the current ARM build plug-ins with a custom toolchain, and redefine the toolchain prefix to match the AVR one?

or continue to use the old AVR plug-ins, as long as they will run on newer Eclipses.

What I mean is that there is no specific code in Sloeber to support debugging. There is simply no need because mcu-plugin does a great job and it works with Sloeber build output.

I don't understand this remark. Soeber builds for avr and debugging is done with eclipse-embed-cdt. So this functionality exists in eclipse-embed-cdt.
Also I can't remember avr eclipse plugin to have debugging capabilities.

The only functionality avr eclipse plugin had that I miss is ""tell me which avr is connected o this com port.
I know there were also maps which someone may miss but I don't ;-) 

Don't get me wrong. IMHO avr eclipse plugin was a great tool dedicated to the avr community. However the avr community is small and functionality has moved to embedded tools.
All open source communities struggle with way more people requesting things than supporting.
As a consequence smaller communities can not keep up.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDIyOTE3Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, avr eclipse plungin had lack debug ability for the first time it came up. And that's what I mean by challenge, if anybody decides to append it to the plugin plus renewing it.

@jantje, if I get you correct, you say everything what was possible by avr eclipse plugin shall still be possible by sloeber?
I am relatively new to the sloeber ide or arduino, etc. What I understood till now is, sloeber does not separate microcontroller types. It just separates boards. Knowing the board, you know the controller. But not vice versa.
You might be right, pointing to a huge community is the way to support tools. But for me as an electrician it's just awful to fix to a specific board all the time instead of selecting the suitable controller for a project and doing stuff around by my own.
With avr eclipse plugin that all was possible.

You are always welcome to disabuse me.

Specifically I'm talking about a scenario where one would be able to do as follows:
- write ITM port 0 to SWV console

- write ITM port 2 to file: /path/to/file-b.txt
- write ITM port 3 to named pipe: /path/to/pipe

Personally to me the ability to log to files or to named pipes is equally important, as it applies to different use cases. Logging to multiple files based on the stimulus port opens the ability to selectively log separate system components or on separate logical logging levels. Writing data to named pipes opens the ability to use tools that utilize them, e.g. Wireshark, which would enable live view on the network traffic happening on the device on multiple interfaces at once.

The ability to log to files done on this level would also fix the issue where current generic logging (Debug Configurations -> GDB SEGGER J-Link Debugging -> Common -> Standard Input and Output -> Output File) consists of interleaved JLinkGDBServerCL and Semihosting and SWV outputs with no option to disable the former.

JLink does this, it provides a separate TCP port, the plug-in echoes everything without any parsing.

- On the SWO port (2332 by default) the data received does indeed seem to be tagged. It doesn't seem to be too complex - the bytes are sent always in pairs with first byte being the tag and second being the data itself. As for the tag - I haven't found any documentation regarding its format, but it's not a simple value directly. For example, sending a single ascii char ""X"" on ITM port 0 results in two bytes being sent: 0x01, ""X"", however sending the same byte on port 1 results in: 0x09, ""X"".
- Plugin seems to use telnet port, not SWO port. Telnet port seems to be just raw bytes as you've said, without the additional tag mentioned above. This is further confirmed by the fact that some combinations of ITM ports resulted in the tag being within printable ASCII value, which Eclipse did not print.

What I'm having problem with right now is that if I decided to use any other port in addition to the ""0"" one used for printf, I'd also get all that data in the plugin SWV output (as telnet port just outputs everything you give it). That means that if I wanted to write my own tool to connect to the SWO port by myself and consume data on ports other than ""0"" (or whatever is configured to be used for printf), it would make SWV console unreadable in Eclipse, as it'd be interleaved printf and ""other"" data in one window. That in turn would mean that I'd have to roll full support for logging on all ports and output that to a separate window in my own tool, while abandoning SWV console in Eclipse which would be unreadable at that point.

Having said that, it doesn't seem to be too difficult to parse SWO port in JlinkGDBServerCL. Read always pairs of bytes -> filter based on first byte -> output second if passed filtering. Even if that was used only to filter out printf data while ignoring data appearing on other ports, that would be a great improvement to me, as I'd be able to write my own tools utilizing those additional ports while interfering with what the plugin outputs to SWV console.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzEwMjg3OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

fell free to write your own parsers. check SEGGER software first, since they might already provide some support.

if you do not need the Eclipse semihosting console, you can ignore it, or disable it completely.

if you know what commands to issue to JlinkGDBServerCL to filter on ports, add them to the plug-in graphical configuration.

the plug-in does no magic, it passes the commands to JlinkGDBServerCL and displays the console; basically you can configure everything SEGGER allows you to configure.

if you discover any problems in how the plug-in communicates with SEGGER, report them here, but this does not seem such a problem.

This is tricky, at a certain point the logic to tell if the server is started was changed to hunt for a string in the console output. It seems that disabling the console prevents this logic to detect when the server is ready. :-(

The solution for the plug-in is to continue processing the console as normal, but do not display it.

I don't know now, but the changes might not be trivial.

For now I suggest to avoid deselecting this option. I might even disable it until a fix will be available.

When I set a value in the my project's ARM Toolchain Paths toolchain folder, like ${my_var}/tools/gcc-7.2.1-1.0/bin, I end up with lots of unneeded messages of the following form output in to my Eclipse log:
 
!ENTRY ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross 4 1 2017-09-30 12:29:31.413
!MESSAGE arm.PathEnvironmentVariable.resolveMacros(""${my_var}\tools\gcc-5.4.1-1.0\bin"", ""Debug"") = """"
${my_var} in this case is a build variable my own plugin defines.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create an Eclipse CDT project
2. Go the project's properties, under MCU -> ARM Toolchain Paths
3. Enter a value in the Toolchain Folder field that uses a valid ${<whatever>} expression in it.
4. Build the project

**Expected behaviour:** [What you expected to happen]

No messages produced to Eclipse error log.

**Actual behaviour:** [What actually happened]

Lots of messages produced to Eclipse error log.

The code in:
ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross.arm\src\ilg\gnumcueclipse\managedbuild\cross\arm\EnvironmentVariableSupplier.java
in the method resolveMacros() always adds this message to the log file with this line:
	Activator.log(""arm.PathEnvironmentVariable.resolveMacros(\"""" + str + ""\"", \"""" + configuration.getName() + ""\"") = \"""" + ""\"""");
It's not checked with Activator.getInstance().isDebugging() first as are most other places in this class. 

### Versions

* [plug-in version] ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross v1.1.2.201707111115
* [Eclipse version] Oxygen 1a
* [Java version] 1,8
* [operating system] Windows 7 x64
* [toolchain version] GCC 7.2.1

Re OpenOCD:

No. There's no RISC-V support in the released version of 0.10.0. And only bits of the support have been upstreamed to the current OpenOCD github development source base (confusingly still called 0.10.0 rather than 0.11.0-dev or something like that as in the past).

You have to build OpenOCD from the RISC-V github or using Liviu's docker based scripts to get RISC-V support. The former is up to date with the latest RISC-V and most upstream OpenOCD changes. The latter is not and is slightly behind the curve.

Re QEMU:

I'm not sure about the status of upstreaming of RISC-V changes to the master QEMU project but you might find out on the RISC-V mailing lists. At the moment upstreaming of RISC-V changes is ongoing, piecemeal and sometimes confusing.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjAyNzgyMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The GME launchers allow adding few commands to the initialization and run/restart. But it seems that they do not allow the multi-line block statements. Single line statements get executed without issue, but a **if** condition or **while** loop which are in multiple lines and need the whole block to function correctly do not work from the launcher.

In the end more complex behaviour can be added to the gdbinit as a defined function and only called from the launcher when needed. And that works well, but I wonder if this is by design or it's a symptom that the commands are sent one by one to the gdb?

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable GDB traces: Windows -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Debug -> GDB -> Show the GDB traces consoles with character limit (default value of characters should be enough)
1. Use regular launcher of a working project (in my case RISCV, but I think this is not target specific).
2. Go to launcher settings -> Startup tab
3. In the ""Initilization Commands"" type the following:

```
if (1)
  print ""if condition true""
end
```

3.  Click debug and open the GDB traces console

**Expected behaviour:** 
Get the condition to be executed correctly:

```
654,867 ~""$1 = \""if condition true\""""
```

**Actual behaviour:** 
The launcher gets stuck the moment it reaches the block statement:

```
750,171 &""if (1)\n""
750,171 ~"" >""
750,172 ~"" >""
750,172 ~"" >""
750,177 ~"" >""

Yes, bugs are in the plug-in, as explained below. Maybe one or another of the bugs is rather in project riscv-none-gcc, although all bugs can be fixed in the plug-in. 

**On your second question**
Yes, the plug-in calls the compiler with wrong command line options.

**Explanation**
The plug-in switch _Integer divide instructions (-mdiv)_ is not effective in presence of the M extension (`-march=rv32im`): By default, GCC implicitly assumes `-mdiv` if the M extension is present. It is required to set `-mno-div` to effectively disable divide instructions in presence of the M extension (cmp. https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/RISC-V-Options.html). 
The problem exists in pre-compiled libs, as stated in my previous comment, but this can be easily fixed by linked the pre-compiled libs for `rv32i` (although I'd prefer an additional pre-compiled variant with M extension but with `-mno-div` passed to the compiler ...). 
In addition, I saw right now that the problem also applies to non-pre compiled code (i.e., the code from the user's project). Plus the tooltip of the _Integer divide instructions (-mdiv)_ plug-in switch likewise implies an assumption about inverted `-mdiv`/`-mno-div` GCC defaults in presence of the M extension.

I suggest to let the value of the _Integer divide instructions (-mdiv)_ switch in the plug-in either result in `-mdiv` or `-mno-div`, but `-mno-div` shouldn't be omitted if the switch in the plug-in is not set (`-mdiv` can be omitted, but I believe it is safer to make it explicit in both cases to avoid surprises in case the GCC default behavior changes).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjI2OTQ4MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In this case the same may happen to the other boolean options, which, when the interface was designed, assumed the `no-*` variant to be the default.

Bear in mind that the RISC-V plugin does allow incompatible options to be specified as far as I recall - e.g. an incoompatible abi for the selected arch. My recollection is that since these are caught by the underlying tools Liviu decided not to do exhaustive configuration option cross checking in the GUI.

Having said that are you suggesting that perhaps the GUI should present both the ""yes"" (e.g. -mdiv) and ""no"" (e.g. -mno-div) options in the GUI to be used in different situations?

BTW I'm also confused what multilib would be selected in this case:

-march=rv32imaf -mabi=ilp32f -mno-div

Since as far as I know the multilibs are arranged by arch/abi only.
Or does the build process provide multilibs for, say...

-march=rv32imaf/-mabi=ilp32f aka -march=rv32imaf/-mabi=ilp32f/-mdiv
-march=rv32imaf/-mabi=ilp32f/-mno-div

Tommy correctly identified the multilibs issue; the settings for most of these extra options must match the options used when building the libraries, it makes no sense to build the main program with `-mno-div` and link it with a library built with `-mdiv`. Probably the same for `-mfdiv` and others.

The second issue is the GUI behaviour.

The initial design assumed that the `no-*` versions are the defaults, but Johannes carefully read the manual page and discovered that this is not true; by not specifying `-mdiv` or `-mno-div` at all, it defaults to `-mdiv` for architectures with the 'M' extension, and to `-mno-div` for architectures without the 'M' extension.

The proposal is to always generate `-mno-div` for projects with this button not checked (the `-mdiv` is generated when the button is cheked, as it is now).

A slightly incompatible proposal would be to transform the option from a binary button to a drop down control, with yes/now/default values.

That seems to make sense alright. 

But it seems moot until/unless the multilib issue is also resolved and at the moment I don't see that the multilib-generator script and the parameter format that it takes is capable of generating separate multilibs for, say...

march=rv32im/abi=ilp32 [implicitly -mdiv]
march=rv32im/abi=ilp32/-mno-div

And I don't know if gcc (or ld?) has the smarts to select the appropriate multilib based on the parameters passed?

Ditto for some or all of the other options (in particular the -m[no-]option options) here:

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/RISC-V-Options.html

On the other hand perhaps the idea is that the user will build the tools with the appropriate multilib[s] and then just make sure to use the appropriate one rather than depending on the tools to infer the appropriate one from the flags passed in?

Probably needs a separate issue for the multilib issue but I don't think that that is a GME issue?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjM3ODQ3MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sounds good. Let me just recommend to let the tooltip explicitly say something like ""If you choose default, please look into the GCC docs"" - the defaults are not obvious.

**On -mabi, -march, -mno-div/-div, multilib toolchain, etc.**
I'm concerned that support for all _valid_ combinations of GCC RISC-V architecture knobs (= _profiles_) for all valid ABIs (x) may not be possible in the multilib toolchain, at least short term. 
However, I also see good reasons to support `-march` - related partial implementations of the M extension (i.e., compared to HW multiply, HW divide is tougher in several aspects). There may be good reasons for partial support of other extensions as well. Those who brought the `-mdiv`/`-mno-div` knobs into GCC may have had similar motivations, but I don't know the details on this ... 
(x): The _set_ of valid ABIs should (just) be a function of an architecture profile. The underlying toolchain may check this for consistency. 

As said in my 2nd comment, I'd also love to see pre-compiled libs for _all_ valid architecture profiles (with at least one valid ABI per architecture profile). But right now, pre-compiled libs for all architecture profiles are not present. There are pre-compiled libs for _some_ `-march` strings. 
W.r.t. the plug-in mechanics, this becomes a problem: If a plug-in user selects to _not_ use HW divide in presence of the M extension (which implies HW multiplication is still there), the _wrong_ pre-compiled libs are automatically _linked_. Namely, the `rv32im` libs, as build by the present multilib toolchain. The result is a binary that likely won't run properly on the target processor. And that's one of these hard-to-find cases (took some time to find out what's wrong...). I hope we can take this burden from other users.

**@ilg-ul On ""..., and I don't know how to address it""**
It seems ther are some alternatives:

1. The first (short term) solution is stated in my 2nd comment. I hope it can be done quickly in the plug-in. That is, if HW dividers are disabled and the M extension is selected, _link_ with the pre-compiled libs for `rv32i`, _not_ those for `rv32im`. In general, this approach (""if there is only a subset of a particular extension present, take the libs for the `-march` setting without the extension"") may be applicable to other GCC knobs. 
Sure, such an approach is sub-optimal because the linked libs use SW multiply only, although HW multiply is supported by the target processor. Well, at least the user code can still be _compiled_ with HW multiply enabled... And the approach seems solid (e.g., several OS distributions do so). Plus, which appears to be the most important aspect, users get a binary that works on their target processor.

2. A second alternative short term solution would be to remove the `-mdiv` knob entirely from the plug-in. But I don't like this one. As stated, `-mdiv`/`-mno-div` makes totally sense from a HW designers perspective, especially for small processors. This option is great - please keep such options in your plug-in in an accessible manner.

3. A third alternative solution is to do your own multilib build scripts, maybe in the riscv-none-gcc project. I don't know whether this is possible or desirable. It is not an GME issue then, sure, but given that (a) project riscv-none-gcc has the github issue tracker disabled and (b) you are contributing to project riscv-none-gcc, I feel no guilt to comment here - I hope you can take the necessary steps. Project riscv-none-gcc already seems to do more than the original RISC-V release from SiFive Inc. and, according to the README of project riscv-none-gcc (section Changes) it reads to me that there is room for more architecture profiles.

... beside what I already said about the value of the architecture checkboxes, the misc field would run into the same linking issues that motivated me to report this issue. If the checkboxes disappear, you even cannot place warnings about lib linking issues (e.g., in checkbox tooltips).

I was not aware of this. Would this be a practical problem? I mean - are frequent builds required?

Indeed, this seems to be very right, although it might be seen as an argument for the first proposed solution.

Too bad to hear this. I'm writing here as an individual, doing RISC-V in spare time. Unfortunately I cannot help the GME project in this respect, nor am I familar enough with the Eclipse infrastructure to quickly contribute a pull request by myself - sorry. No community momentum/interest from other vendors?

See above. I believe GME will loose a lot of value for RISC-V. The plug-in did an excellent job for me since I installed it, thank you!

I meant the latter.
More and more it seems to me that it's almost impossible to have build a toolchain that meets every user's requirements - I thought that just building all arch/abi multilibs would go most of the way towards this but now that the -m[no-]option options are considered this further complicates matters. Building a single toolchain with all possible arch/abi x all relevant -m[no-]option options (a) is currently not possible (b) will probably be complicated and require changes to how the tools find the ""appropriate"" lib based on the arch/abi and other options and (c) will result in a toolchain that is huge because it's further bloated by an increasing number of multilibs. 

At the moment my feeling is that the plugins should just present all relevant options (the GUI presenting the ""commonly used"" ones and others can be input manually into ""other"" options fields) and let the underlying tools do what they do. I don't think that the plugins can easily try to validate all options to ensure that they are valid to the underlying tools or result in a successful compilation. In short I think that the user needs to know what they're doing and the plugins can't spoon feed them too much.

> As said in my 2nd comment, I'd also love to see pre-compiled libs for all valid architecture profiles (with at least one valid ABI per architecture profile). 

I'm not clear on what you mean by ""profiles"" here.
Do you mean arch/abi tuples multiplied by all relevant -m[no-]option options?
At the moment the multilib-generator script and the arguments that it takes to create the t-elf-multilib file cannot cater for the -m[no-]option options as far as I can see.

We [Microchip/Microsemi] already use a modified version of Liviu's build scripts to build multilibs for all archs and their ""native/natural"" abi - excluding any E libs because E is not standardised. This results in 39 sets of multilibs c. 1.25GB in size. Multiplying by the all combinations of -m[no-]option options would explode this further.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjU5MTM4NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Just to be pedantic I don;'t think that every -m[no-]option multiplies ALL libs by two since they may not apply to all arch/abis - e.g. -m[no-]div only applies to M arch/abi tuples and not non M ones.

But would that work for ALL -m[no-]option options and other architectural options here:

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/RISC-V-Options.html

In at least some cases (e.g. -mpreferred-stack-boundary=num) the client code AND library code must be compiled with the same option. I don't know if this also applies to others in the doc above?

> Note that, on the technical level, I do not think that I'm talking about heavy-weight multi-parameter validations. Or do I miss something here?

Sorry - I introduced that because it is related but not something that you raised.

I suspect that many (most?) RISC-V users will probably be targeting a specific architecture profile (meaning arch/abi/other architectural options) in which case they can probably get or build a toolchain that is built with that as the default target eliminating the multilib confusion (maybe?!). Trying to cater for all possible targets in the toolchain and/or in the plugin looks somewhere between difficult and intractable at the moment.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjY0NTA2OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I don't think it covers potential issues of mixed `-mpreferred-stack-boundary` settings. It seems beyond subsets of extensions in target processors (in this case, the M extension) and the associated wrong linkage. Nonetheless, `-mpreferred-stack-boundary` may not be a big practical problem at all, at least right now: Fortunately `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num` isn't accessible to users of the plug-in(x), and the pre-packed binary toolchain, https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/releases, which is de facto shipped with GME, can be consistent in itself. I guess it is already consistent in itself.

If we want to go there - feels a bit like package management, package compatibility analysis, and so on and so forth... Likely nothing that can be done short term. And likely not in scope of this issue report. 

(x): Unless I have overseen it in the plug-in (?). Of course I'm not talking about the text box that allows users to do arbitrary weird things ...

This issue is not an issue of GME plugins, but the underlining CDT (even with regular native gcc tools). Regardless this affects the GME as well so for completeness I reported it here as well, but there is no point trying to solve it here. So probably this should be marked as won't fix? If anybody is affected by this and want to contribute to the discussion, the Eclipse/CDT bug the link is here:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=539927

In simple terms CDT 9.5.x will mark build failed on any **stderr** message regardless if the build works or not, while **--print-gc-sections** by design always put the removed sections verbose messages into **stderr***:

```
--print-gc-sections
--no-print-gc-sections
List all sections removed by garbage collection. The listing is printed on stderr. This option is only effective if garbage collection has been enabled via the ‘--gc-sections’) option. The default behaviour (of not listing the sections that are removed) can be restored by specifying ‘--no-print-gc-sections’ on the command line.
```

This issue was not experienced in Oxygen/CDT 9.4.3 while it is experienced in Photon/CDT (tested 9.5.0, 9.5.2 and 9.5.3) regardless of the host OS and target platform.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use GME plugins with CDT 9.5.x which comes with Eclipse Photon
2. Use a project which builds correctly under normal conditions.
2. Clean the project (if the project is built already it will not trigger the error message)
3. Enable the ""Print removed sections"":
3a. For RISC-V projects: **Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GNU RISC-V Cross C Linker -> General -> Print removed sections (-Xlinker  --print-gc-sections)**
3b. For ARM based projects: **Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> Cross ARM GNU C Linker -> General -> Print removed sections (-Xlinker  --print-gc-sections)**

**Expected behaviour:** 

```
12:22:50 Build Finished. 0 errors, 0 warnings. (took 6s.935ms)
```

**Actual behaviour:**

```
riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld.exe: Removing unused section '.text._kill' in file './riscv_hal/syscall.o'
riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld.exe: Removing unused section '.text._link' in file './riscv_hal/syscall.o'
riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld.exe: Removing unused section '.text._lseek' in file './riscv_hal/syscall.o'
riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld.exe: Removing unused section '.text._read' in file './riscv_hal/syscall.o'
riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld.exe: Removing unused section '.text._stat' in file './riscv_hal/syscall.o'
riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld.exe: Removing unused section '.text._times' in file './riscv_hal/syscall.o'
riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld.exe: Removing unused section '.text._unlink' in file './riscv_hal/syscall.o'

(I trimmed the log for sake of brevity)

12:23:21 Build Failed. 182 errors, 0 warnings. (took 2s.482ms)
```

The binaries will be present and if they worked before they still work, only Eclipse thinks the build failed.

### Versions

* Not dependant on GME plugin version
* Eclipse Photon and CDT 9.5.x
* Observable on multiple Java versions
* Can be replicated on Linux, Mac and Windows
* Independent on toolchain version or target as the linker was always reporting removed sections to stderr

What version?
What version of Eclipse, Eclipse CDT, and Eclipse Embedded CDT does it use?
Maybe try with Eclipse for Embedded C/C++ Developers instead of e2studio since the latter is outside the scope of this repo/project?

I tried my previous setup with the xPack arm toolchain v10.3.1-2.1.1 instead of the latest and I still did not get the problem.

That's very odd. I didn't get the problem with the older toolchain that you were using when I used it with the latest Eclipse for Embedded C/C++ Developers. But, either way, with the latest xPacks and Eclipse the issue is not present.

In some cases open project settings C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings on ARM projects can make the whole UI unresponsive for ~30 seconds. This is due to GTK3 handling in Eclipse (and CDT) was not efficient and structures were increasingly slower the more content they had. Where ARM dropdowns can have ~100 entries.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use GTK3 on Linux Eclipse Oxygen or Eclipse Photon.
2. Create example ARM project with GME plugin wizard.
3. Open settings with C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings

**Expected behaviour:** 
Open within 1-2 seconds.

**Actual behaviour:** 
Opens in ~30 seconds.

### Versions

* Plugin version doesn't effect the problem
* Eclipse Oxygen or Photon
* Java doesn't affect the problem
* Linux

The issue can be worked around on Eclipse 4.7 Oxygen by setting:
```
export SWT_GTK3=0
```
Which will force GTK2. But for Eclipse 4.8 Photon this will create problem as the GTK2 is in process of removal, so even ARM settings might open in timely manner there still might be other problems/glitches. For ARM projects it's best to use either 4.7 Oxygen with GTK2 forced, or use GTK3 on Eclipse 4.9 where the GTK3 slow downs were sorted out. 

In essence the Eclipse 4.8 Photon users should either downgrade to 4.7 or upgrade to 4.9.

The GME developers do not have to do anything, as this is out of their hands, but probably this could be mentioned in the 
https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/support/known-issues/
or 
https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/support/faq/

I think there was somewhere the GTK2 trick, but AFAIK there no mention about this being fixed in 4.9 or that the GTK2 trick on 4.8 might create other undesired effects (especially when libcairo is pretty recent version).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/325/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So the **${cross_prefix}** macro is not resolved when it's checking the version. Shouldn't the Configuration.getGdbServerCommand used on the macro executable to get the resolved actually executable before running it?

@pccdac If you open your debug launcher -> Debugger tab and in the copy the ""Actuall executable"" content and paste it into the ""Executable name"". In my case I can make it work even with versions which were not working before.

aha. so you think the new Eclipse changed something in the way macros are processed, and `${cross_prefix}` is no longer resolved?

Peripherals view shows the proper peripherals from the SVD file, but is unable to actually provide any register values. Also, once a peripheral is ""checked"" in the view, it cannot be unchecked. All the SVD parsing in the debug console looks to be correct and successful. I am using Segger JLink to debug. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start a debug session
2. Click the Peripherals view and select a peripheral to view
3. Watch as nothing happens...
4. Try to ""uncheck"" a peripheral
5. Watch as it cannot be unchecked 

**Expected behaviour:** 
One can view the status of the peripheral registers

**Actual behaviour:** 
Nothing shows up for the peripheral registers, and the checkbox for a peripheral cannot be unchecked.

Could you pls explain what you mean by this? 

I thought the peripherals were just the macros defined in the CMSIS headers (so for me, LPC54606.h)? 

If it adds any additional info, I'm able to see the ethernet peripheral in the ""Expressions"" view, if I add a watch expressinon of `(ENET_Type*)<address of enet peripheral>`, however the `ENET` macro defined in the CMSIS header doesn't resolve on the fly (see below image)

since I've seen quite a lot of bugs, I'd like you to check the stm32f407 device, to rule out a plug-in general bug on your platform and restrict the search to the LPC546xx svd case.

> any debug output

first check the workspace/.metadata/.log file for any exceptions

as for debug options, yes, there are quite a lot, but you need to start Eclipse with a `-debug file`, as explained in https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/developer/build-procedure/; an example of debug options can be seen at https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/blob/develop/debug.options

Actually right now I'm working on a simpler alternativ, called xmake, which I plan to integrate into my workflow and the plug-ins.

For now xmake builds projects with make/ninja, and builds/runs tests. Right now I'm working on the exporter to Eclipse; next the importer from Eclipse is planned, and later an internal builder, which will run the build directly, without the need of a separate tool (like make/ninja).

There is still a regression in the pyOCD plugin where the error message for an invalid pyocd-gdbserver path not being shown in the launch config window. This is likely to be related to Eclipse changes.

`TabDebugger` is calling `setErrorMessage()` on itself to display the message. This used to work but doesn't appear to any longer.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a pyOCD launch configuration.
2. Enter an invalid path for `pyocd-gdbserver` in ""Executable path"".

**Expected behaviour:**
An error message stating ""pyOCD gdbserver not found where specified"" should appear near the top of the launch config window.

**Actual behaviour:**
No error message is visible.

When I go to view/edit the Debug settings (e.g. for J-Link), I can't see some of the settings towards the bottom as the Window isn't large enough and the panel of widgets does not scroll.  You can test/verify this by making the window smaller and will notice you can't access the hidden widgets.

The panel of widgets should be scrollable.  E.g. with the C++ Build Settings, I can scroll the panel around to access all the settings.

I'm using a MacBook with 15"" screen, Eclipse 2018-09 (4.9).

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new J-Link Debugger configuration
2. Click on the `Debugger` or `Startup` tab
3. Some of the settings at the bottom are not visible (e.g. `Force thread list on suspend` or `continue` checkboxes).  This may be dependent on system font size, scaling, etc.
4. The problem can be seen by making the window smaller.
5. Try panning around with two button pan gesture (I could not get the contents to pan up or down).

**Expected behaviour:** [What you expected to happen]

Expected to be able to pan around the contents to gain access to all fields.

**Actual behaviour:** [What actually happened]

All attempts of panning do not work.  No pan occurs and only the top/left fields are visible.

The C++ Build Settings behaves slightly differently and I can pan around using my trackpad gestures (two finger pan) if I apply it the right areas.

With the Debugger Settings the scrollbars don't seem to be present at all.  i.e the don't even show up momentarily and the whole pane of widgets just doesn't seem to be scrollable at all.

If you could get the Debugger settings to behave the same as the C++ Build Settings then that would be the best outcome.  At the moment I am lucky enough to have a larger external monitor available to get to some of the other settings, but that's not always the case.

Other possible workarounds:

- Decrease the large vertical space between the cancel and ok buttons at the bottom of the window, and the bounding box of the tabs.  It's just wasted space.
- Rearrange some of the widgets so as to use more horizontal space (i.e. wider dialog box and less 

height).

Device: Microsemi SmatfFusion2 M2S010 
Program: simple program FreeRTOS 10.0 and two tasks.

I've built simple program using FreeRTOS that starts two threads. After flashing on chip it is working properly. I can debug it without problems when not using RTOS support in OpenOCD. After enabling RTOS support in OpenOCD (I've added --command ""$_TARGETNAME configure -rtos FreeRTOS"" to OpenOCD command line) I can debug program correctly using command-line arm-none-eabi-gdb. Also debug configuration in Eclipse that only attaches to running target works fine. 

However when running debug configuration that restarts MCU it is not possible to debug target: MCU is halted but Eclipse is not reflecting that (no source line is highlighted/no stack trace/etc). Attempt to pause program execution results in 'Interrupt failed' exception. 

In gdb traces I can see that Eclipse tries to switch to thread and gdb server is responding with ""Thread ID 2 not known."" 

Logs (https://gist.github.com/Novakov/4772ec4142f067dc3c9ec8d2f77f67e0):
* OpenOCD log output (default verbosity) 
* gdb traces log


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use SmartFusion2 device
2. Create simple FreeRTOS application (two blink tasks)
3. Create debug configuration for OpenOCD 
4. Use Microsemi fork of OpenOCD (bundled in SoftConsole)
5. Use following command line arguments for OpenOCD: `--command ""set DEVICE M2S010""  --file board/microsemi-cortex-m3.cfg --command ""`$_TARGETNAME configure -rtos auto""`
6. Debug program

**Expected behaviour:** Program is running on MCU, hitting breakpoint shows list of threads.

**Actual behaviour:** MCU is halted, Eclipse looks like waiting for something. Hitting Pause results in 'Interrupt failed' exception.

* OpenOCD with RTOS enabled running in console
* GDB Hardware debugging with Generic TCP/IP configured for OpenOCD

Result: a bit different:
* After starting it's stopping on random line of code and shows correct task list
* Resuming and stopping causes 'Interrupt failed' exception

It's seems to me like GDB is getting tasklist before OpenOCD performs flash operation (which include halt and MCU restart). I have no idea (unfortunately) how the internals works. Unfortunately I don't have any MCU that can work with OpenOCD now, so I'm unable to rule out possible problem with OpenOCD modified by Microsemi.

If someone here is willing to verify the issue with another MCU, I would be greatful.

When you're debugging ""standalone"" from SoftConsole/Eclipse/GME are you sure that you're telling GDB to use the gdbinit/softconsole.gdbinit script bundled with SoftConsole as it does some stuff that may make a difference when debugging? For example if the debug session is downloading the program to envm and then executing it from there then the gdbinit script will set the $sp and VTOR (Vector Table Offset Register - the address of the vector table) correctly. If you don't use this then these will probably be wrong and this might explain the behaviour that you're seeing?

Edit: oh - just noticed here:

https://gist.github.com/Novakov/4772ec4142f067dc3c9ec8d2f77f67e0

that you're presumably not using the gdbinit/softconsole.gdbinit script which could explain some (not sure if all) of your problems?

When targeting SmartFusion2 it is important, in the general case, that gdb uses the gdbinit/softconsole.gdbinit script bundled with SoftConsole. That is the same with both SoftConsole v5.x and v6.0. The SoftConsole Eclipse/CDT/GME based IDE is preconfigured to cause this to happen but when using gdb ""standalone"" you need to provide the script to gdb yourself. If that's not the problem here then I'm not sure why the problem arose with SoftConsole v5.3 at the moment and would need to replicate your setup (or something similar) to check. In the meantime are you OK with using SoftConsole v6.0 if things are working there? 

BTW what M2S010 board are you using? Is it the Maker board?

That is an understatement, hope the Trenz guys will do more boards with our FPGAs.

When the $target_arm variable is not set then the gdbinit will go into the auto-detection branch and maybe then together with the rtos could get confused?

Wonder what would happen with the SC 5.3  with $target_arm set.

Yes, the OpenOCD situation is not ideal.

This [SVD file](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/files/2757320/subset.svd.txt) (excerpt from a SVD file for an ARM device) contains a peripheral with registers organized in clusters. Each cluster contains the dim and dimIncrement elements to define an array. In the Peripherals view, the first element has the correct register addresses but each subsequent element has the same register addresses as the first element.

![address](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46693006/51145778-ba3f6580-1809-11e9-9611-c8c9700667b7.png)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a GNU ARM Eclipse debug configuration. As far as I know it should be possible to view the register addresses in the Peripherals view even if the addresses are not compatible with the actual target. It should not be necessary to build and load an actual program to use the Peripherals view. (I was not able to get the QEMU debug configuration to work with this version of GNU MCU Eclipse; I used an OpenOCD target with a Cypress PSoC 6 device).
2. Start a debug session, open the Peripherals view, and open the PERI_MS peripheral
3. Observe the register addresses

**Expected behaviour:**
The register addresses should be:
PPU_PR[0].SL_ADDR 0x40010000
PPU_PR[0].SL_ADDR 0x40010004
PPU_PR[1].SL_ADDR 0x40010040
PPU_PR[1].SL_ADDR 0x40010044
PPU_PR[2].SL_ADDR 0x40010080
PPU_PR[2].SL_ADDR 0x40010084
...

**Actual behaviour:**
It looks like the Peripherals view did not take the cluster's dimIncrement into account:
PPU_PR[0].SL_ADDR 0x40010000
PPU_PR[0].SL_ADDR 0x40010004
PPU_PR[1].SL_ADDR 0x40010000
PPU_PR[1].SL_ADDR 0x40010004
PPU_PR[2].SL_ADDR 0x40010000
PPU_PR[2].SL_ADDR 0x40010004
...

This issue is not exactly the same as [#150](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/150) which is already fixed--the clusters have addressOffset=0 so they are not affected by #150.

```
Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers
Version: 2018-12 (4.10.0)
Build id: 20181214-0600
```
And my installed GNU ARM C/C++ Packs (Experimental) version is ```2.2.2.201704251808```.

When I try to create a new STM32F0 project, in this page I use default settings for RAM and FLASH:
![default settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18757974/51155070-39d43f80-18b1-11e9-8ac9-c066ed61444c.jpg)
So I can see that the generated file ```mem.ld``` is in accordance with the settings:
![mem_ld](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18757974/51155198-af401000-18b1-11e9-9840-7ab197313f78.png)
But if I open the project options and try to chosse a particular device,  STM32F098CC for example:
![device selection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18757974/51155373-3db49180-18b2-11e9-8126-73706e75c286.png)
The RAM size of STM32F098CC is 32KB, and the ROM size of STM32F098CC is 256KB, which is not the same as the settings I used when I created the project. After I click ```Apply and Close```, the file ```mem.ld``` is not changed. 

I have already read this page:
https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/eclipse/project/assign-device/
It says:
```
Accompanying the device there is also a set of definition for the memory map, which will be used in a future release to automatically generate the linker scripts.
```
Does it means that, at present, I have to modify the ```mem.ld``` manually if I want to write programs for different device?

I don't know if you noticed, but the other debug plug-ins can use a separate *.svd (or *-xsvd.json) files, without the need to have an associated CMSIS Pack.

this is one solution to avoid the huge packs.

the other solution I'm considering is repacking the svd files (possibly converted to json) in separate xpacks, grouped by vendor, so there will be no need for CMSIS Packs at all.

Inside the ""debugger"" configuration tab provided by the GDB SEGGER J-Link Debugging plug-in, the input field for the IP does not allow special characters (e.g. # § $ % &).
This is problematic, as the ""IP"" that is passed to the J-Link does not necessarily have to be an IP address when connecting to a J-Link via a tunneled connection using the J-Link Remote Server.
(More information about the J-Link Remote Server can be found here: https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/tools/j-link-remote-server/).
An example of such a connection string would be:

tunnel:$MyNickname§:#MyPassword#

Which is not possible to enter into the IP field at the moment.

### Steps to Reproduce

In Eclipse...
1. Open **Run** -> **Debug Configurations...**
2. Select a debug configuration from **GDB SEGGER J-Link Debugging**
3. Switch to the  **Debugger** tab
4. Try to enter ""**tunnel:$MyNickname§:#MyPassword#**"" into the ""IP"" input field

**Expected behaviour:**

I expect to be able to enter my tunnel-connection string into the IP-field.

**Actual behaviour:**

It is not possible for me to enter special characters like $ § # and so on...

If we would be able to have a option to switch between the 2 different logic (or being able to populate the Project name field with ${project_name}). Then using this would allow more dynamic launchers and therefore you might end up needing less launchers satisfying more projects, have less mess and not have to worry as much about so many launchers.

Taking a step back and looking at the top level, my coworker was mentioning that other IDEs let you choose the debugger for the project first, let's say J-Link, CMSIS-DAP, or ST-Link, etc.    Then, you configure that debugger to allow debugging, download, erase functions.    

For my projects, I create launch files for various debuggers so my customers have a choice.  I currently have 3 launch files (debug, download, erase) for 3 debuggers for a total of 9 launch files.  I configure download and erase under the run menu only.    Ideally, once the debugger is chosen in the project, then you could just click the debug icon to debug, or click on a menu to select download or erase.   

For now, I'm thinking about creating an external tool batch file that will let the user select a debugger, which will copy the chosen debugger launch files to the 3 commonly named launch files used by the project.    For example if J-Link is chosen in the .bat it would copy  jlink_debug.launch to debug.launch.  And, jlink_download.launch copied to download.launch.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjY2OTYzNA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

First, external launchers are different from debug launchers, and the initial request was for an enhancement to the debug launchers.

Second, although project-less debug lanchers are possible, I remember there were some limitations, including avoiding the macros defined in the project configuration (like ${cross_prefix} that you mention); thus I generally would not recommend project-less debug launchers.

>  if I replace the actual project name with ${project_name} in the Project: field

I'm afraid this is not possible, that field is the link between the debug launcher and the project, where do you suggest to get the value of the macro if the project is not known?

The beauty of this approach would be that the original behavior would stay same, existing per project launchers would stay working. And who wants to take the risc (no pun intended :) ) could use it the new way.

It would figure out what project it is by checking what is the parent project of the currently selected resource in the project explorer.

On the Common tab, you can select whether they are under Debug or Run.   I put download and erase under Run.  For download and erase, I have the launcher execute with command line arguments for OpenOCD so it does the operation and exits debug.   For J-Link, it executes some commands in ""Startup->Run/Restart Commands"", one of those being to ""quit"" debug.

I didn't mention ${cross_prefix}, but I'm using that in my launchers successfully right now.  I assume because the project name is hard coded.

Ideally, if I only have 1 project open, then it would recognize that and just debug that project, even without having to select it.   But, if multiple projects are open, then like AntonKrug suggested, you would have to select one of the open projects in Project Explorer before clicking debug.

With the new approach the old approach would still work, but if the Project Name would contain macro, it would resolve the macro first depending on what is the currently selected resource into a project and then continue as the original approach.

The idea is not end up with one launcher to rule them all, but to significantly reduce them, so in the end you might end up with DEBUG_ARM and DEBUG_RISCV but you will not have dozens of RISC_Vs even when they are the same. 

It would make the DEBUG/RUN approach much more feasible as well. Where there would be 2 launchers with only difference that the RUN wouldn't break in the main and ignore other breakpoints, which is similar to disabling breakpoints, disabling in the break in main in the launcher and debugging it.

I don't know if this is realistic, the Project Explorer might not even be present in the perspective where you want to start the launcher, or it might be present, but not visible, with nothing selected, or with a wrong selection.

as far as I know, Eclipse generally does not favour linking functionality to the selected resource in this indirect way, you generally have to right click on the resource to access the available actions.

personally I'm not very confident that this is a good idea, apart from the weird situations when you push a button and it displays a message telling you to make the Project Explorer visible and select a project, you can easily mess one target by clicking the button while the wrong resource remained selected. not to mention that if targets require separate configurations, like device names, or different speed settings, the risk of messing things is even greater and debugging these cases is even more difficult.

but what puzzles me a bit is the use case, the need to create and maintain huge numbers of debug configurations, due to huge numbers of projects in the same workspace of the same Eclipse instance.

first, debug configurations should be created only once, when the project is created, preferably automatically by the project template, and stored as .launch xml files in the project; that's the reason of using macros in it, to avoid full paths and other non portable definitions; storing them in the project allows sharing them with other developers via the repository, without having to recreate them on each workspace.

second, only tightly related projects should be in the same workspace. for experimental/research environments probably people tend to put more projects in the same workspace, but for production environments ideally one project per workspace should be seriously considered.

even more, for really serious projects, a project not only should have its own workspace, but also its own Eclipse instance, to avoid messing projects when one project needs one version of Eclipse and another one does not (yes, upgrading Eclipse has the risk of making changes in the workspace, making it crash in an older version). 

people tend to forget that Eclipse is actually a folder that can be placed anywhere in the filesystem, and there is nothing wrong with having as many Eclipses as necessary. (I probably have several tens, I lost count of them).

I know that some vendors do not agree with this (sorry Anton), and insist on providing multi-GB super tools with everything but the kitchen sink packed inside, tools that it is not reasonably (sometimes not even possible) to install in multple versions/instances, but GNU MCU Eclipse does not recommend this approach and is specially designed to favour multi Eclipses, multi toolchains, and generally modular approaches (for example via xPacks).

so: modularize your environment, use multiple workpaces, possibly multiple Eclipses (which will also allow you to start many in parallel), save debug launch configurations in your projects and probably things will not be as complicated as you present.

Multiple target boards would have own debug launchers but you would be able to switch between them faster than creating them for each project. In your ideal case when your template will create project to target board A and now you have to target board B and C, what will you do? Create new projects from templates for board B and C? And how easy it will be switch between them when your code is maybe developed and debugged on board A, but then tested and deployed on board B (when A might be more debug friendly variant of board B, but different enough that you need separate launcher).

""some vendors"" actually have the Eclipse portable and you can have dozens of them installed, move them and run multiple instances of them. For example we wanted allow people to use one specific plugin and it was not portable, so we up-streamed a change to make it portable so others can benefit it from it as well. But that doesn't mean we force you to use it that way. 

With this change there is the beauty to use as you using it now, no change and use your flow as you want (including having 1 project per eclipse), while allowing you to have multiple projects in same instance, in the same workspace if you prefer so. If Eclipse was not intending to be used that way, then they wouldn't never make the workspace mechanic in the first and would be more in style of VisualStudioCode.

the xPack builder (a command line equivalent of the Eclipse builder) favours adding new build configurations for each board. if the project is portable, I think this is the reasonable way to do it.

> Could xPacks orchestrate the eclipse installation, plugins installation and settings for all plugins you need for that project?

The xPacks design is completely unrelated to Eclipse and its plug-ins and does not depend on Eclipse specifics at all.

xPacks are specialised npm modules, that can be automatically pulled in a project to contribute versioned source files (like C/C++ files), and binary tools (like toolchains, builders, etc).

after the xPack command line tools will be ready, probably the first graphical tool to integrate them will be Visual Studio Code. Eclipse was also considered initially, but given the direction where Oracle is heading Java (did Microchip pay for your license?), and Eclipse slowly loosing traction, it is not guaranteed to happen.

I know, but when you share a project and it's dependent on specific feature of a specific plugin, or settings in your instance, because you propose many different instances which can be very different from each other then the receiving end now has to match your current instance. When you are going to transfer the project, now you have to transfer the whole eclipse instance. 

Or you have to reconstruct the instance on other side in a deterministic way or the project will behave differently on the other side. 

Yes it is out of scope of xPack, but then the ""1 project per instance"" can't be solved with xPack approach.

well, we probably have different understanding on some details, but I think you more or less got the general idea.

yes, anything related to GUI interactions is out of the scope of xPacks, but reconstructing a build environment in a deterministic way is exactly the purpose of xPacks and ""1 environment per project"" (which is a more accurate way of saying  ""1 project per instance"") is the mantra.

the nice thing is that, if you want to use Eclipse for headless operations, you can easily pack Java as an xPack, Eclipse as another xPack, refer them as dependencies, and, together with one or more toolchains, builders, emulators, etc, all packed as xPacks, always create exactly the same development environment, and run tests in a deterministic way, locally, in a portable way on most modern platforms, and, even more interestingly, remotely on a CI server, like Travis.

similarly to npm, running `xpm install` inside an xPack folder will download all dependencies, add links  to executables in a local `.bin` folder (or `.cmd` scripts on windows), and then add `.bin` in front of the `PATH` when running any of the tools. each project has its own `.bin` folder, so isolation is trivial.

you can easily see that the platform where this environment runs can be absolutely bare, only node.js/npm and xpm installed via npm. everything else is handled by `xpm install` as dependency. as for npm, dependencies do not even have to be xPacks, install can also handle custom scripts, so any scriptable tools can be used (although binary xPacks, like the existing toolchain xPacks, greately simplify this).

What needs to happen in everyone of those cases is it has to use the CDT variable resolvers that use the C Project's info too. 

I am not exactly sure what needs to happen, but [this code](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt/blob/main/launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalRunLaunchDelegate.java#L122-L133) is what makes the environment variables from the project available to the target program, so adapting that should work.

I think that VariablesPlugin (which provides access to global variables, not project ones) needs to be replaced with (or enhanced with?) ICdtVariableManager usage, sort of like this untested code:

```java
ILaunchConfiguration launchConfig = // launch configuration
IProject project = // project from Launch config, may be null/blank
ICProjectDescription projDesc = CoreModel.getDefault().getProjectDescription(project, false);
// check projDesc for null (if null, use existing VariablesPlugin method to resolve vars)
String buildConfigID = launchConfig.getAttribute(ICDTLaunchConfigurationConstants.ATTR_PROJECT_BUILD_CONFIG_ID, """"); 
ICConfigurationDescription cfg = null;
if (buildConfigID.length() != 0) {
    cfg = projDesc.getConfigurationById(buildConfigID);
}

// if configuration is null fall-back to active
if (cfg == null) {
    cfg = projDesc.getActiveConfiguration();
}

String programPath = launchConfig.getAttribute(ICDTLaunchConfigurationConstants.ATTR_PROGRAM_NAME, """"); 
programPath = CCorePlugin.getDefault().getCdtVariableManager().resolveValue(programPath, """", """", cfg);
```

The link in my comment points to all the java files that need to be updated, unfortunately - explaining Eclipse Plug-in development is out of scope of what I can teach. However there are some great resources out there. Please start with the excellent tutorials on https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ and once you are familiar with Eclipse plug-ins/Java development I would be happy to guide you further.  See also the [Contributing section of the Eclipse CDT readme](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt#contributing) for how to start editing CDT.

Find on RISC-V registers will make the UI unresponsive and eventually crashes

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Extract fresh copy of 20190101-2023-gnumcueclipse-4.5.1-2018-12-R-win32.win32.x86_64 (tested mainly on 64-bit Windows 10, but can replicate it on 64-bit Debian 9 )
2. Create new fresh workspace
3. New C Project -> SiFive RISC-V Project -> HiFive1 Blinky POSIX semihosting (the project settings might not have impact on it, nor the target, can replicate it with RISC-V 64bit, emualtion, real HW, looks like any RISC-V can have this issue)
4. Build the project and (create corresponding debug launcher) connect to the target and break anywhere (but main is fine). 
5. Open Register view, expand the generic registers group them.

6. Click on one of them to put them into focus and press CTRL+F for the ""Find"" feature
7. Watch you CPU and memory to spike.
![reg-ctrl-f-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30338596/56911739-8ed54380-6aa5-11e9-8cd0-f88ccd661232.PNG)


**Expected behaviour:** 
To see the Find dialog:

![reg-ctrl-f-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30338596/56908647-9c3aff80-6a9e-11e9-80fa-07fab8895dc4.PNG)


**Actual behaviour:** 
Get non-responding process, 100% CPU utilization, memory allocation increased, the dialog not showing up and if waited long enough it will crash with ""Java heap space"" error message. I get lot of ""Warn : Got exception 0xffffffff when reading csr3563"" warnings (with many CSR numbers, which do not even seem to be fetched sequentially). See the attached log, which was concatenated for brevity, but it kept running and logging out warning very quickly all the time:

[reg-ctrl-warn.txt](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/files/3128274/reg-ctrl-warn.txt)

Sometimes when I manage to terminate quickly the session I will get the dialog (of course now it's no good).

Does this happen when using the CDT alone (GDB Hardware Debugging)?

I also suggest you monitor the GDB dialog, in the GDB trace console (not visible by default, you need to enable it explicitly).

My guess is that the problem is caused by the huge number of registers used by RISC-V.

The ARM doesn't even need scrolling when the dialog is resized a bit, it might be related to the ""need to be resized"" that this dialog was never designed to have so much entries to get scrolled through:

My theory is similar that it is possibly present in ARM just the number of registers are in reasonable size where the internal data-structure doesn't fall apart when it contains more entries. Previously the ARM had issue as the target CPUs contained lot of options, so CDT improved the internal data-structure. But the ""Register Find"" was maybe forgotten and still using some inefficient structure which explodes exponentially. It looks very similar to these:
https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/307
https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/313
https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/325

So it might be similar problem just not fixed on this GUI element (while the others got re-implemented properly).

I didn't test the CDT directly , I expect the native GDB will not have a problem (like ARM does) and it might still contain the issue. So I need to figure out how to prove which module is actually the cause. I might run OpenOCD/emulation by hand, help it a lot and setup things by hand and then see what it does. Or the other idea what I had that I will pinpoint corresponding source code and then it might be clear where the cause of the problem is.

It might be inherited issue from CDT, but CDT might not experience it directly, so even if it's not GME caused issue probably it would be good to keep it here so it's a known limitation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzkwODU3Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

yes, selecting the Register tab takes a long time to populate the content, and trying to Find also takes long time to open, but then the selection of the desired register seems ok. the UI is hardly usable if the Registers tab is concerned, but otherwise the debug session seems functional.

I'm afraid you are fighting a lost fight, as long as OpenOCD will list all those thousand registers, debuggers using it will have a hard life to handle them.

When I use the SiFive FreedomStudio, which looks to be based off of the GNU MCU plugins, I can download and debug. I use the same J-Link V6.46d in both cases, so it looks to be the plug-in commands being sent to JLink that is the issue.

Attached are logs from both for more details.

When you open PyOCD debug configuration Eclipse hangs for approximately 15 seconds, only after that time debug configuration is available. Opening PyOCD debug configurations is extremely painful when you need to make some fixes few times in a row.

Key notes:
- reproducible on Windows only
- not reproducible if PyOCD path points to wrong location
- there are a lot of TCP/IP traffic when you open PyOCD debug configuration - for some reason plugin communicates with pyocd gdb
- this is not machine-specific, I have heard from lots of people about this problem

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create new fresh workspace
2. Create new Project
 - go to **File** -> **New** -> **C/C++ Project**
 - select **C Managed Build** and press **Next**
 - fill in **Project name**
 - select **Project type** = **Empty Project**
 - select **Toolchains** = **Cross GCC**
 - Press **Next**, **Next**, then **Finish**
3. Create new debug configuration
 - go to **Run** -> **Debug Configurations**
 - right click the **GDB PyOCD Debugging** and choose **New Configuration**. Creation takes up to 15 seconds (for OpenOCD time is < 1 second)
4. close **Debug Configurations** window
5. go to **Run** -> **Debug Configurations** and select PyOCD debug configurations. Observe it hangs for ~ 15 seconds

Screen capture: https://drive.google.com/open?id=19quDPapnm-weUgKgK6Nfpx4AqBjn_6nH

**Expected behaviour:**
PyOCD debug configurations opens faster (like OpenOCD does, it takes up to 1 second)
**Actual behaviour:**
PyOCD debug configurations opens ~ 15 seconds

### Versions

* pyocd 0.21.0
* GNU MCU Eclipse 4.5.1.201901011632
* Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers. Version: 2018-09 (4.9.0). Build id: 20180917-1800
* Eclipse CDT Version: 9.5.5.201811180605
* Java 8 Update 211
* Windows 10 Pro x64
* Cross GCC, but that actually does not matter

Sorry about that!

I'm not sure exactly why opening the plugin would be slower on Windows. It may depend on the connected board(s). Specifically for boards with on-board STLink, it can take noticeable time under Windows to map the STLink USB device to the mounted drive letter and read the board ID (to auto-detect the target type). The delay would be longer for each additional STLink-based board that is connected.

The plugin needs to be changed to asynchronously populate the popup menu with connected boards.

Regarding the TCP accesses, I don't have any idea what that would be. The pyOCD plugin runs `pyocd-gdbserver` to generate a JSON list of connected boards (similar to `pyocd list` but in JSON), but that is returned via stdout. It doesn't use the network for anything.

I'll see if I can reproduce this in my system.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDI0NDY0MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The problem is that if the server is not yet ready to accept TCP connections, the GDB client will enter a TCP timeout & retry cycle, which takes like forever for the waiting user. We can add a small fixed delay, but how long should it be? It depends on the virtualised device/board, thus it must be configurable, which makes things even more flimsy.

Correction, the message should not be displayed after QEMU is started, but **after** the GDB server is ready to accept connections. Any message is fine. For example J-Link displays ""Waiting for GDB connection..."" and the xPack QEMU fork displays ""GDB Server listening on: 'tcp::1234'...""

The device in question is: AT91SAM9G20

Old setup:
Kepler SR2 (Build id: 20140224-0627)
GNU ARM C/C++ Cross Compiler Support 1.8.1.201402180751
GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors 7.4.1.20130913

New setup:
Eclipse IDE 2019‑06 (Build id: 20190614-1200)
GNU MCU C/C++ ARM Cross Compiler 2.6.4.201901011632
GNU MCU C/C++ J-Link Debugging 4.3.4.201901011632
GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors 7.4.1.20130913

The old setup was using J-Link v4.90. The new one has been tested with v4.90, v6.22a and v6.50.

So the old setup has of course worked for years with no issues. However, after upgrading I no longer am able to set breakpoints in the C code. It will be shown as a breakpoint, but not set on the device (no check mark and no error indicated in the icon). If I press ""Show breakpoints supported by selected target"" in the breakpoints view, it disappears. They reappear if I deselect it. If I manually set breakpoints in the Debugger Console, it works. If I go in the disassembler view and set breakpoints on the assembly, it works too! If I step into/over/return it all works fine.

I believe this from the Debugger Console might be on to something:

The breakpoint I'm trying to set is indeed in main.c, and if one ignores the double \\ the path is correct. 
For the record, this works fine on Linux with identical versions of the items listed above.
This leads me to believe there is something Windows specific about this, possibly related to paths. 

Are there any way for me to get a more verbose output to know what GDB is actually started with and how the breakpoint is sent to GDB? It would be nice to rule out some kind of issue with the path provided.
As for the warning: I have tried ""show language"" in the debugger console, and that gives back
```
The current source language is ""auto; currently c"".
```
That is admittedly a bit contradictory to the warning it provides earlier. It also makes little sense since when I try to set additional breakpoints, it will spit out an additional
```

Yes, as it turns out this is an underlying issue with GDB. I have essentially re-discovered this issue: https://answers.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+question/240419
I am unsure what has changed between the versions to introduce a use of absolute paths from Eclipse, but I can only assume that's the case here. Doing an objdump as suggested in the link shows me relative paths to the source. I tried manually to set additional breakpoints and there seems to be absolutely no path resolving at all in GDB. Unfortunately some of the source seems to be built with ""src/./Foobar.c"" as the name, and it would seem that it has to match exactly when setting the breakpoint. Thus even ""src/Foobar.c"" doesn't work.

Sorry, maybe I didn't make it clear. It works fine with GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 7-2018-q2. Breakpoints and everything works there. Now I just need to convince the necessary people to upgrade the toolchain.

However, if I choose a newer version GDB prints out ""Couldn't determine a path for the index cache directory."" during start-up and then GDB shuts down fairly soon after that. I believe that is a separate issue that I am far from certain is caused by Eclipse or any plugins.
Also, I re-tried the latest version (8-2019-q3-update), and now it suddenly works even though the warning is there. So it is very weird and I wouldn't pay much attention to that unless it's reproduced.
My conclusion therefore is there must be something else going on that I need to track down if the issue reappears.

>
> But do you think there is anything (reasonable) to be done in Eclipse to avoid these bugs?

It's a bit hard to tell. It works with a new version. I don't know how stable the code for paths in gdb is to really provide any input here. If it has been rewritten and is now in a fixed state, then there isn't much to be done. I certainly don't expect anyone to really fix bugs for a 6(?) year old version of a toolchain.

Thanks a lot for your great hint. I found the additional details of plugin in marketplace did not include the latest eclipse version number ""2019-09 (4.13)"". As a result, the marketplace client rejected to install plugin with an error message ""the following solutions are not compatible with this version of eclipse"".

I have a project that make use of a custom bootloader. Since the bootloader is placed at the start of the flash to intercept reset vector, the main application is offset farther in flash.

If there is no bootloader present on flash, debugging session with only the main application starts only without Pre-run/Restart reset enabled. If enabled, execution stalls at 0x0 (due to nothing programmed at start of flash. Also, without Pre-run/Restart reset enabled, the ""Restart"" button in eclipse isn't working.

It looks like OpenOCD or GDB isn't taking into account the entry point of the firmware's elf.

Using STM32l115RET6 with ST-Link v2.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Build program with entry point not at reset vector
2. Launch openocd/gdb debug session with Pre-run/Restart reset enabled
3. Pause execution

**Expected behaviour:** 

Pausing execution somewhere in the code

**Actual behaviour:**

Execution is stalled at 0x0 because elf entry point isn't at start of flash.

However, in your use case, I'm not sure what you expect. Do you expect the debug session to take into account the ELF entry point and start the debug session from there? I would say it does, but by enabling the **Pre-run reset** you ask the debugger to issue a hardware reset and this simply overrides the entry point.

Anyway, the idea of debugging devices with code starting at a higher address and leaving the bootloader space empty is very risky.

In case you do not know exactly how things work, here are some details.

To start a debug session, first the plug-ins ask gdb which asks openocd to issue a reset. This is equivalent with pressing the reset button. Immediately after this, the plug-in sends to gdb which sends to openocd a command to halt; openocd starts to talk via the JTAG protocol with the device and asks the JTAG logic to halt execution. Ideally halt should occur before executing the first instruction, which is a hard wired jump to the Reset vector, but due to the limited speed of the logic inside the plug-ins, inside gdb, inside openocd and especially the speed of the communication via JTAG, which is initially set to a low speed, it is possible that the core will start to execute something, and if you leave the flash empty, you may get unexpected behaviour.

For most cases this is not relevant, the core may be in any state, but the JTAG interface should always be functional and it will be able to write the flash, and possibly to set any breakpoints in the debug circuitry, which is separated from the core.

Then comes the second reset (the Pre-run reset), which resets again the core, but this time with the flash expectedly valid, and the breakpoints set, so if you have a breakpoint at the Reset_Handler, it will trigger.

As far as I remember (sorry if I miss something) the ELF entry point is used by the debugger to set the PC before continuing after the initial reset. 

If you do not enable the Pre-run reset, and the debugger was fast enough to halt the core before triggering an exception, this entry point will behave as a jump that will be executed, regardless of the address of the Reset_Handler.

If you enable the Pre-run reset, this will be executed, and the address of the Reset_Handler will be used, regardless of the ELF entry point.

Given the above, I suggest you reconsider the use case, and, if you agree that this is not a bug in the plug-ins, close this ticket.

For any other questions and support, please use the project forum.

I must admit inner workings of JTAG debugging are still a mystery to me.

Anyway, what I can grasp of all this is it's not possible to reliably debug a program on MCU if start of flash isn't correctly populated; using OpenOCD/GDB combo at least.

I was under the impression it was possible. I recently migrated a project from CrossWorks and their debugging suite will make it work. Flash between 0x08000000 and 0x08007FFF is empty and I can succesfully start a debug session reliably and reset execution to start of program.

I don't know how debugging in CrossWorks work, it is probably fast enough to halt the core immediately after reset.

But from your message I understood that with the secondary reset disabled it also works with OpenOCD. And, in case the debugger does not use the ELF entry point, you can always set it by hand.

Nope. For the template to work, it needs to be fully described to Eclipse, which means a proper Eclipse project must exist. And if you want to be able to install the template from an Eclipse update site, you must also define a feature project, and a repository project.

So you need at least three Eclipse projects. There are maven tasks to build them, but it is still quite a lot of work to put things together.

I do not know of any documentation apart from the CDT source code, which I also used to write my plug-ins.

The ones that are already part of [Orbit](https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20191126223242/) will be easier/faster to use as you only need a piggy-back CQ. A quick looks sees that most of the jars in there are already in Orbit, but not the same versions.

Yup - we can do a CQ for this code too and add it to orbit. Current (last updated 5 years ago) URL is https://github.com/zafarkhaja/jsemver

No need to do it first. The ip team aren't really checking your code compiles, just licenses and that you haven't copied code from anywhere (i.e. That licenses and copyright actually match code provenance)

Is that this project, because I find some things utterly horrifyingly hard to get done and make this work.

In my situation I have about 6 applications, that share about 8 common libraries.  I continuously find it hard if not impossible to setup projects

For me, I have a single flat top level directory with 8 “libWHATEVER” directories, and 6 “appWHATEVER” sub directories, this is sort of my ‘workspace’.  Note that I am very open to another configuration or structure but don’t have a good solution that work to build what I need, put another way:

The directory looks like this (this is a simple config)

```
<root> — 
   + .git
   + ProjectDocs
   + app_main
        +include

When I try to create some means to build & compile static LIBs + APPS, it’s painful really painful  - I must be doing something wrong

**I must be doing something wrong.**

Managed build - works - if your project is 100% self contained - copy all your source code into a few directories and you are done - but that means I have 6 copies of the same library buried in the 6 projects - aka: Clone And Own...  This does not scale very well.

But for me, I have many: -I paths, that are relative to the current project and point “up an over” to the neighbor projects, ie: `-I${ProjPathDir}/../libFOO” 

Using CMake to create GNU-MCU eclipse project files is non-trivial and not very clear. If somebody can point me to this, that would be great ... but I don’t see a solution here.

Using Makefile Projects would be nice, but I need to run on Windows and - well yes MAKE is present - but NONE of the helpful Unix tools are present and/or usable ie: simple things like using awk, sed, grep, perl, or python - is painful on windows because there are so many providers/flavors of these tools (msys, cygwin, git-bash, etc, powershell) - I’d really like to be cross platform (win/mac/linux) this helps with other automation I’d like to have in place.

FYI - The “Freedom Studio” - from SiFIVE is nice - the last time I used it (6 months ago) part (1) it actually builds using MSSYS on windows and not simple MSDOS CMD.EXE and Part (2) they require this so they can run ./configure scripts, and (3) In their last release. I used they added the ability to install more tools into their private MSYS instance, so for example if you need a unix tool on windows you can install it the extra tools :-) it’s not a closed solution

GNU-Eclipse does not have that option - the Makefile solution is purely windows centric and that is all you get. Sigh....

yes, there are other build systems that work in Eclipse, ie: SCons... and Ant and ... you name it.  The further away from Eclipse core things the harder it is for team members to understand how to be productive.

**To illustrate the point**

One of the super hard things is just getting the include directories (ie: compiller “-I/path/to/some/dir” type options ) consistent across (X) library projects with (Y) applications and (Z) configurations ... it is horrifying how hard this is

Take for instance FreeRTOS, it has freertosconfig.h -(LWiP has the same thing) as does MBED-TLS  - each of these are libraries - with configuration files that taylor the library at compile time.

How can I setup the 5 library projects to switch configurations? Damn that’s hard, when I switch from APP(A) to (B) - I really don’t want to edit all the project files that is horrible.

For instance: must modify 6 different “-I” settings for each project (The C/C++/ASM paths TIMES Debug/Release = 3 * 2 = 6),  times 4 libraries + 1 app = means 30 dialog screens, and no means to cut and paste between projects dialog boxes.

There’s another 30 in the -D command line defines,  add another app or two - I’m at over 100 dialog screens to hand edit. This does not scale.

There are another 30 screens to get Warnings and Options consistant.

Oh of course, you can also edit XMLfiles and do this the way Real Men do their job

**What are my other options**

Internal to various companies (ie: Texas Instruments) they have a “eclipse project creator tool” that is custom to their environment

Any suggestions? This is beyond frustrating.

You can have all of these as separate projects and then configure the lib projects that each app depends on in each app project's settings. Yes each app project will have its own copy of the include directives, link library settings etc but I don't see that as a problem or unexpected? Definitely you don't have to copy/duplicate the library sources into each app project.

To make things worse, a small test program using this class with the Keil URL worked as expected. 

I don't know why the behaviour is different when used inside Eclipse.

This class has a way to control if redirects are followed, and initially I thought that in Eclipse this setting is configured differently, but after checking it, it proved to be set as expected.

I'll further investigate and try to find a workaround.

Yes.

Unfortunately the small test was done with https, which worked. I retried it with http and it failed to follow the redirection, so the Java class behaviour is consistent.

Currently, when pre/post build steps are created during Makefile generation, they are done such that all errors are ignored. This is by by design, and IMHO very poor design.

my request is simply this:  Please make this a configurable option, if desired - this could be  “ignore by default”

A very simple use case:
    I need to run a “post build step” that converts the ELF or HEX file into some other format that is usable by my flash update/upgrade ability. For example, my flash utility needs to check a CRC value, and/or a checksum and/or other signatures that are part of the download.  Normally a post processing script would do this.

    Another example is this: I have some small data files that need to be converted (ie: binary to C file (a giant array of bytes).

Sometimes things go wrong and these tools report errors, but Eclipse ignores these errors.

I'm amazed to find how different we see the market.

I'll start with what I think we do agree on; 
A. _eclipse-embed-cdt_ is for embedded MCUs
B. 8-bit MCUs are still MCUs
C. 8-bits are less than 16-bits which are less than 32-bits etc...

I invite you to google up  ""_8 bit microprocessor market share_"" and see for your self why I'm so amazed to read your comment ""_not exactly the future_"". My thoughts are exactly the opposite from yours, I think the 8-bits MCUs are the future, especially in the IoT era where devices are disposable and not fixable.

A major reason is that the power/performance numbers makes 8-bit devices very unattractive for IoT and a lot of other markets, especially in advanced process nodes (""advanced"" for MCUs being 40nm with flash, or 28nm without flash).

Oops! That's exactly the opposite of what I expected, J-Link is ok, and all other are wrong. :-(

Also to be noted is that the field used for grouping is `bundle.vendor` from the branding plug-in, not the `providerName` from the feature, as I expected.

Right, just that I checked the `providerName` in the feature, actually I copied most of the properties from OpenOCD, not the `bundle.vendor` from the branding plug-in. :-(

It did, I recreated the binaries and now it is ok.

Thank you very much!

And, if you allow me a small suggestion, perhaps the About code could trim the string, to become insensitive to such small inconsistencies.

I'm not sure if this could be avoided by a better CDT mirror configuration, but if there is anything we can do to avoid such cases, I think we should.

I guess the trick is done by `<generateDownloadStatsProperty>true</generateDownloadStatsProperty>`.

Great! I am going to try to adapt what you figured out back to CDT as it looks useful and simple enough.

> 
> However, I'm not particularly happy with the large number of records generated for a single install. All 42 features and plug-ins left a line in the server.

A slightly more refined query should help I suppose. Others may have more experience. Mickael Istria has had numerous discussions about stats on cross-project-issues-dev in the past.

> 
> In my opinion, since during install the user can only select which features to install, only the feature records are necessary, and the plug-in records are mostly redundant.

That is true for direct installs, but for end users who install a non embed-cdt feature that only references some bundles from embed-cdt those stats would not exist at all.
 
> Also the feature names (`ilg.gnumcueclipse.debug.gdbjtag.qemu.feature.feature.jar/3.4.1.202008191141`), with the extra `.feature.jar`, seem not very inspired.

I think that is the standard across eclipse, i.e. that is what appears in the .target files IIRC

Summary -> :-) Wonderful getting the stats enabled. I hope it provides you useful info in the future!

One question I have - and perhaps you have discovered the answer now. If you contribute embed-cdt to simrel, do you have two sets of stats to consider? The jars in simrel and the jars in your project repo? Or does the p2 magic combine all of that?

Good question! The current p2 repo is generated by a clone of [org.eclipse.epp.packages](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages) where I added my code, and my code is a clone of CDT with several additions.

It is a maintenance nightmare and I would be grateful for any suggestions on how to simplify/automate things.

To answer your question, I guess that the jars will remain the same, so the stats will remain the same, they are per project, but I'm not sure I understand all details.

Here is what I'm trying to build.

`com.espressif.idf.debug.openocd` is our plugin which is derived from `ilg.gnumcueclipse.debug.gdbjtag.openocd` with customized configuration for OpenOCD debugging.

Here are my plugin dependencies which it has.
 -  ilg.gnumcueclipse.core,
 -   ilg.gnumcueclipse.debug.core,
 -   ilg.gnumcueclipse.debug.gdbjtag,
 -   ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross

Now when I install **Eclipse Embedded CDT OpenOCD** feature and **our customized OpenOCD plugin** - they will see two debug configuration options ""GDB OpenOCD Debugging"" and ""ESP GDB OpenOCD Debugging"". This might be confusing to the end-users. To avoid this confusion to the user I want to show only ""ESP GDB OpenOCD Debugging"" but not the other one. 

I was thinking I could achieve this if there is a way to install only core gnumcueclipse plugins

I see... 

However in this case, the OpenOCD debug plug-in does not offer CLI functionality (those who need CLI will go directly to `gdb`), and there are no unit tests for it, so the separation does not bring much.

We'll probably leave it as it is for now.

For that, I need to replicate gnumcueclipse plugins in my repo and build a feature. I think from the code maintenance perspective, that's going to be tedious.

@kolipakakondal  I assume you mean git repo - you can have a feature in your git repo that includes plug-ins not in your git repo. The feature in this case would be called something like ""com.espressif.idf.debug.openocd.feature""

I'm talking about git repo @jonahgraham. Maybe I'm complicating the issue, I'm sorry!

com.espressif.idf.debug.gdbjtag.openocd <<< Here is my plugin and it's dependecies
   -  ilg.gnumcueclipse.debug.core
   -  ilg.gnumcueclipse.debug.gdbjtag
   -  ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross

How do I get above dependencies to my target Eclipse without installing the ""Embedded CDT OpenOCD Debugging"" feature? Is it possible? Could you please point to some resource to achieve this? That would be a great help.

 Please find the below attachment. As you can see I've two OpenOCD Debugging configurations.  All I want is to get rid of ""GDB OpenOCD Debugging"" option

If we take `ppc64le` as reference, most references to `ppc64le` are followed by references to `aarch64`, so apparently `aarch64` should have the same functionality as `ppc64le`.

However, since there are no packages built for `ppc64le`, this might not be enough.

Checking for `x86_64` returns way more references, which probably explains why `aarch64` is not yet functional.

For example there is no `org.eclipse.equinox.security.linux.aarch64` bundle, to name only an easily visible difference.

It looks like the Equinox repos need some more `aarch64` definitions.

It will be the Platform I-build from around that date (29 July's build IIRC).

If you want to know how the simrel is populated and what is in the current staging p2 repo see https://git.eclipse.org/c/simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.build.git/tree/ (when embed-cdt is ready, a new file will be added there with the pointer to the embed-cdt p2 repo to contribute to simrel)

Note that it is bad practice to build your project that you are contributing to simrel against simrel. However lots of projects do it. CDT does not, the CDT target platform points at the individual dependencies we need so that CDT can control what it gets. Generally we update to new Eclipse Platform milestones only (e.g. every 3 weeks or so). So CDT currently uses the 20200729 build of Platform and will change again next Friday.

The reason we update on milestones only is that milestones are more rigorously tested than nightly (aka Integration) builds.

Ah, that explains it.

The only definition that I see in my EPP fork is:

```
    <eclipse.simultaneous.release.repository>http://download.eclipse.org/staging/2020-09/</eclipse.simultaneous.release.repository>
```

If there is any nightly or integration build that includes the the platform and CDT with Aarch64 support, I can test it, otherwise I'll wait for M3, the EPP code is too complicated for me to make it point to different locations.

Then you have a toolchain path problem, since GDB uses the current toolchain path. Did you select the xPack Arm GCC as toolchain for the project?

Anyway, to be sure, download a new Eclipse package, install it in a separate location, create a new workspace and run the blinky arm tutorial.

I'm now testing 5.2.1, which was needed to accommodate some path changes in xPacks.

Hmmm... maven if far from my favourite tool, I don't know what identifiers you mean.

I can try to add that `update.matchExp` and see if it helps, but I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing.

This exceeds my current experience with Eclipse.

Also 4 & 5 will be painful.

From my point of view, it would be great to have 2 addressed before 2020-12, and I can try to experiment with `update.matchExp`. Hopefully Marc will help if needed.

For all the other points, we'll address them when you and Jonah will consider reasonable, my only concern is rushing before a significative release and messing things.

I had a look at the plug-in, and while there are indeed UI elements in the `plugin.xml` and other places, as long as it depends on `org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core` then there will be a transitive UI dependency as `org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core` depends on `org.eclipse.ui`. Same thing goes for `org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.gnu.ui` - the `org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.buildDefinitions` that I assume RISCV are dependent on come from the .gnu.ui CDT bundle.

The org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder bundles are almost UI free, but a number of changes would be needed to make them fully UI free.

@ruspl-afed I was wondering which specific parts you want pulled into the core bundle? And further are you looking at make a runtime that does not have any dependency on org.eclipse.swt at all? i.e. I am trying to understand the difference between the ideal design (proper core/ui split) and the practical problem you are facing.

Basically everything that is free from
* org.eclipse.swt
* org.eclipse.jface
* org.eclipse.ui

The problem is `Activator extends AbstractUIActivator` - it should be split for core and UI as well.

> there will be a transitive UI dependency as `org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core` depends on `org.eclipse.ui`.

You are right @jonahgraham , but these UI usages are not in the API and can be eliminated without CDT API break at any moment. 

> are you looking at make a runtime that does not have any dependency on org.eclipse.swt at all

yes, this is the practical part, I would like to avoid failures for UI-less environments.

In the [p2 wiki](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Customizing_Metadata#Update_descriptor_advice:) there is a solution to use `update.matchExp`.

Why not merge the rename-feature-folders branch back into develop and then into master?

Is this only to collapse all changes into a single commit?

Yes, if we change the bundle IDs we have to declare a major release. Otherwise, for the features rename I would not do it yet; integrators could stick to 5.2.1 until 6.x will be ready.

But I still don't know if it is safe to do it for 2020-12.

Usually all the merges to develop/master in GitHub are performed via PRs, it allows to discuss the change set and to check it with CI pipeline.

AFAIK Embedded CDT doesn't have any consumers inside SimRel except EPP. So, from process perspective such a change can be done before RC1 the latest. However it is better to plan and announce the change like this before the SimRel cycle starts and to apply it for M1.

I found the [SimRel schedule](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Category:SimRel-2020-12), contributions should be frozen by Dec 4th, so we have about one month. 

Thus, if you agree, and help me review and merge the current changes, I would like to try to also change the bundle IDs and Java packages to the new names, and go directly to a major v6.x release.

I'd reserve two weeks for this, with two weeks for tests.

In case of problems, of course we can always delay merging the new changes for after 2020-12.

However it looks like the pom-less configuration does not use separate namespaces for plug-ins and features, since I get:

The maven wiki reads:

```
This error signals a collision of project identifiers during a reactor build. The 
coordinates for a project as given by its group id, artifact id and version must
be unique within a reactor build. The usual cause for this error is a typo in one
of the POMs so please verify the project coordinates are correctly set.
```

The name was changed from `ilg.gnumcueclipse.doc.user` to `org.eclipse.embedcdt.doc.user`, which is also the name of the associated feature.

@ruspl-afed, can we do something to improve the pom-less configuration to accept this situation?

Reverting to feature names suffixed with `.feature` is not exactly nice, since it leads to public names like `org.eclipse.embedcdt.doc.user.feature.feature.group`.

In Embed CDT, currently features display the version of one of the plug-ins, which is fine if the feature includes only one plug-in, but not so fine if the feature includes multiple plug-ins.

The main problem I have with the current versioning scheme is that the release/branding version is not visible when seeing the list of features during install. I tried to improve this by adding a 'Core' feature, which includes the `.core` plug-in, which has the top version, but it is still confusing.

My proposal is to use the same versioning scheme as CDT, i.e. all features to have the top/branding version.

https://git.eclipse.org/c/cbi/org.eclipse.license.git/

However it has no README, nor any other documentation page, so using it is totally obscure.

I added the two attributes to all `<feature>` definitions:

```xml
<feature

      label=""%featureName""
      version=""6.0.0.qualifier""

I removed the `licenseURL` and `license` definitions from `feature.properties`

```
licenseURL=license.html
license=\
Eclipse Foundation Software User Agreement\n\
...
```

And I also removed the `license.html` file.

The result is that the build fails:

I saw CDT uses a `cdt.target` file with some definitions that seem related to this issue, but I don't use such a file, and I don't know how to fix it.

@ruspl-afed, any suggestions?

I also removed the `license.html` reference from `build.properties`.

I also removed the `<license>` element from `feature.xml`:

```xml
   <license url=""%licenseURL"">
      %license

The documentation does not mention if it is required or not, but since I removed the actual definitions from `feature.properties`, I though they are no longer needed.

Verify if the current configuration allows the builds that Alexander mentioned, and possibly improve them.

 Fri Nov 27 04:50:30 CET 2020
 File .repos.xml does not exist, using defaults.
```

This is being reported as an error so shows as such in the .log or in the Error Log view. However it looks like a warning or info. Can the log call be changed?

If I create a new STM32F7xx C/C++ Project with default settings I get a template error at the end of the wizard. I am not 100% sure this is a Embed-CDT bug, it may be a CDT one in the template handler code?

The problem was caused by a failed rename of the file.

For historical reasons, the macOS filesystem is in fact case insensitive, although the case is preserved and shown properly; for unknown reasons, Git checks the case insensitive names, and simply renaming a file with a different case does not make it dirty, so it is not committed.

Could you take a look at the result in `develop-internal` and let me know if the way I renamed the UI classes related to preferences/properties/views/perspectives is ok? If so, I'll merge it and it'll be the final 6.0.0.

Alexander @ruspl-afed, does this change match your expectations? Do you have any suggestion on other classes to be moved to the internal namespace? If necessary, we have a few more days for last minute changes.

BTW, I understand how moving classes to the non-exported internal namespace hides them from curious integrators, but for the objects that have IDs, this is not 100% efficient, since they can use the IDs without importing anything.

Actually there is one such case in the project, the codered perspective makes use of the peripheral registers view.

Am I missing something?

> The name ""internal"" is just a convention - it needs to be marked as x-internal for the API tooling in Eclipse to warn users of the API that it is internal.

I added a few commits to mark a bunch of the code as internal. See commits, their commit messages have additional details

* e3676409eb Export all packages and mark all internal packages as such
* 82b1d1e01d Mark third-party code as x-friends
* fe3ff6c839 Mark all Activators as non-API

Note that e3676409eb may be partially questionable - we can discuss whether to use the export all package or not rule. The Eclipse Platform recently changed the recommendations. I personally strongly object to that, and embedcdt is not bound in any ways by their rules. The current rules for Platform are https://wiki.eclipse.org/Export-Package the old policy was https://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php?title=Export-Package&oldid=237317

The key part of the original policy for me was ""The community's desire/need for the freedom to access non-API is overwhelming. In fact, this forms a critical part of the Eclipse ecosystem by allowing experimentation and investigation."" - but some people now find that it caused extenders to use the not exported API instead of contributing back. Of course for years I was that community and my personal interest and success with Eclipse ecosystem was because of that experimentation and investigation.

Anyway, feel free to revert e3676409eb, but I would keep at least some of the changes - such as marking the exported packages with internal in their name as x-friends, for example https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/e3676409eb746c0853992b04808882b214f042cf/plugins/org.eclipse.embedcdt.managedbuild.cross.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF#L30-L35

I guess we can do this, but this means there will probably never be more updates, since further merges will be impractical, almost impossible.

If you can explain me exactly what the problem is, perhaps I can figure out a solution. If the actual semver classes are not public, is it still a problem?

It seems strange to worry about further merges on code that has not had a commit [upstream](https://github.com/zafarkhaja/jsemver) in >6 years.

Is Semver modified, I thought it was, but I see that liqp is also modified. If Semver is not modified, then adding it to orbit is a good solution.

>

If one bundle exports a package, any other bundle (embedcdt or not) can import it. So there are a few issues:

- If the package you are exporting is not versioned and identical, then depending on how OSGi and p2 resolve stuff, simply having embedcdt installed can break other people.
- If multiple bundles export the same package (e.g. org.json.simple) then p2 can decide to use either one to resolve it. This means that embedcdt's presence can cause unexpected results for other packages
- for places where these types are used in API, it the consume of the API does not use the same loaded versions of these classes, then at runtime you can class exceptions that are very hard to track down

For all the above cases, the results are generally not deterministic, so depending on random other factors, such as version of Java, how many plug-ins are installed, etc you can run into a problem.

None of the above is urgent. However it is technical debt that can come back to bite us down the road. After having spent days resolving a similar issue in simrel I am trying to protect against that for the future.

> If the actual semver classes are not public, is it still a problem?

If the packages are not exported it is not a problem. If they are exported, even if x-internal, then it is a problem. The modifier (public/private) on the class itself does not come into play.

It shouldn't be a nested jar. But we can fix that later as it is quite minor.

You add the Orbit repo as another entry to https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/2e12c1b97d96a588fac81ef443792b82b905c85b/parent%2Fpom.xml#L66-L75

and then you republish these extra dependencies to your p2 site in https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/e89616ff5cbbf06ef977124e2e4ee5d63e081aff/repositories%2Forg.eclipse.embedcdt-repository%2Fcategory.xml#L110-L111

a diff like this would probably work, but I haven't had a chance to try it.

I noticed that orbit has jsoup 1.7.2 and 1.8.3. Assuming there was a reason you went with the older version I added the extra version ranges above to make sure that the 1.7.2 version was chosen over the 1.8.3 version.

BTW - putting together the above diff reminded me of another problem with nested jars. It removes the compile time checks for dependencies. i.e. removing lib/org.jsoup_1.7.2.v201411291515.jar does not cause a compilation error, but presumably will cause a runtime error.

The current development flow for embedcdt (as documented on https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/develop/build-prerequisites/#install-several-eclipse-plug-ins) is designed to be the only thing in the workspace. So in this development flow, developers would just have to in the ""Install several Eclipse plug-ins"" section also install org.jsoup and other dependent plug-ins.

However, moving to a target file means that you can detach the development version of Eclipse from the target version. That is what happens with CDT, developers use cdt.target to define the target platform instead of ""Running Platform"" in target platform preferences.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDAxMzYxOQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The result still builds locally and runs (more test after CI & Jenkins are ready).

However the number of warnings increased significantly:

```

I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing.

In my use cases, Activator classes are used extensively, not only for debugging purposes, but also to share preferences between .core and .ui plugins.

Jonah @jonahgraham, the code is in `develop-internal`, for review and further improvements.

But aren't changes like this:

There are four cases of warnings I see that cover most of the warnings
- lots of warnings in liqp - If this was moved into a new bundle, the warnings for this bundle could be set to info. This requires .settings to be checked in though.
- lots of provisional API usage - This can be solved in two ways - one create the usage problem filters (requires .settings/.api_filters to be checked in) and the better way is for CDT (and others) to mark this provisional API that has been provisional for 10+ years to be no longer provisional anymore!
- lots of warnings about progress monitors - to fix this requires moving to the newer progress monitor API. There is quite a good write up on the new API and how to migrate here https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html
- Unknown referenced nature: org.eclipse.m2e.core.maven2Nature - This one happens because I don't follow https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/develop/build-prerequisites/ precisely, specifically I don't use the m2e plug-ins for Eclipse when I am developing Eclipse plug-ins and using Tycho.

You do not follow the steps in the build-prerequisites page because they are not correct? If you have a better configuration, we should improve the web page.

Otherwise I think that it would be better for you to have a separate Eclipse and a separate workspace, installed exactly as documented, so we can have a consistent way of spotting errors.

This mode of use is particularly suitable for embedded projects since developers often use command line build systems and only need Eclipse Embedded CDT for the debugger.

Probably the best approach would be to build an alternate version of the standalone debugger application that includes the Embed CDT plugins. The standalone debugger presents a special UI for native debug that allows users to skip traditional launch config creation (though you can open the standard launch config editor instead). It's not clear whether this is a good idea for Embed CDT since the launch config interfaces are quite a bit more complex than for native debugging.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/472/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, sure. But there is also an Arabic saying 'If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain'. :-)

I'm currently working on a version of the managed build process that runs outside Eclipse, and will use CMake/meson/xPack Build, that I'll try to integrate both in Eclipse and in Visual Studio Code. Once this is done, the next step would be to move the functionality of the debug plug-ins (J-Link/OpenOCD/QEMU) to Code.

If you confirm that it runs fine on macOS & Berries, and I can install it somewhere in my home folder, I will give it another try. If I remember right, when you first contributed the plug-in, I tried it, but something went south on my Mac and could not make it work.

> You still need Node.js and npm installed first to use xPacks.

Binary xPacks are plain archives, you download them and extract in any folder, and without any special system prerequisites, they just work. You can hardly beat this with any Python application.

It is true that for a full xPacks experience, you need Node.js. But if you read the install documentation carefully and follow the instructions by the book, you always get a functional Node.js/npm environment, on all supported platforms. And once you do this, xpm does the rest of the job.

I don't want to say that Python is not ok, just that, for me, the install experience was not great; you can probably improve it with a better documentation.

Very nice, I didn't realise that!

And yes, pyocd really needs better documentation. The user base has grown enormously over the past 2 years (especially since STLink support was added) and the need for better docs has been ever more apparent. In the background I'm working on a pyocd.io site and more docs.

plus that there is a web-preview site, which is automatically generated when I push changes to the develop branch.


the xPack and the µOS++ sites too, I recently updated them all (previously I used Travis, but it became very slow).

once configured, everything is automatic, I work on the develop branch, check the results, and when ready, I merge develop to master.

very convenient.

I don't know how used the standalone debugger is. There have been discussions about discontinuing it from CDT, but no action on actually removing it. There have been less than 400 downloads of the CDT 10.0 version since it was released in Sep. As a comparison, the C/C++ package has >850,000 downloads. So no one is really investing in this area at the moment. *However* the C/C++ package can be used as the standalone debugger, and I am not sure how many people use it that way.

However, the important feature the standalone debugger brought to CDT was ""project-less"" debugging. That was a critical feature for CDT and just requires a user to be able to create and use a launch configuration without an associated project.

The standalone debugger creates a workspace automatically without prompting the user, but does not create projects. To navigate the source files it uses the `Executables` view which parses the elf (or similar) file for debug info to extract the sources that make up the executable. I added a `Debug Sources` view in 2019-12 that does the same kind of thing, but uses gdb to list the sources being debugged, which is more reliable and does not require CDT to parse elf files. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn910#Debug for more info on the latter.

The launch configurations (I tried QEMU one) seem to work fine without a project - just that the defaults that rely on project settings need to be set in the launch configuration instead.

My conclusion is that there isn't anything worthwhile doing on this issue, assuming the project-less debugging is indeed working. If it is not working, I think specific bugs on the failing paths would be useful.

Therefore, I recommend closing this for now.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDM2ODM2Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It's good to know the standalone debugger is likely to be removed.

One question I have is what the difference is between CDT and the C/C++ package? Does the former mean installing CDT via Help > Install New Software…, and the latter the ""Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers"" in Eclipse Installer?

I do think the embedded space is potentially different from native C/C++ debugging. Imo, there is a place for a stripped down Embed CDT focused on debugging. Most of the embedded developers I know dislike Eclipse primarily because of all the baggage included with a standard install.

However, I'm fine with closing this issue. Sounds like a standalone Embed CDT might better be something new rather than based on the CDT standalone debugger.

I'll definitely take a look at the Debug Sources view, and will test and work on any issues with project-less debugging.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1Njg3NzU2Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

CDT is the Eclipse *project* (collection of plug-ins) that support C/C++ development. 

The C/C++ Package is the *product* that contains many Eclipse plug-ins beyond just CDT that are C/C++ focused and packages them as a single download for the user. The main ones being CDT, but also include TraceCompass, Linuxtools and others. See [product release info](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-12/r/eclipse-ide-cc-developers) (expand `Detailed features list` for all the features in the C/C++ Package)

As Liviu said above, the Embedded C/C++ Package is mostly the same as the C/C++ Package, but targets embedded engineers by including the Embedded CDT project's plug-ins too, along with other customizations that Liviu's experience over the years has helped shape a product that is more embedded focused.

I have a feature request for the ""Debug Configurations"".
Although it is possible to use Eclipse as a GUI frontend for GDB without creating a project, when also using a SVD file, creating a project is obligatory. One can associate a SVD file with a debug configuration, but it is also needed to create a project file (which can be empty) and then to choose a device, otherwise the ""Peripherals Register"" view will stay empty.

My request would be to add an input field to the debug configuration to be able to choose a device without needing to explicitly create a project (but in addition to a possible selection by a project), to make it possible to use the SVD file and therefore the ""Peripherals Register"" view.

The issue is a bug in the p2.inf to handle the name change

The org.eclipse.embedcdt feature when it was created I assume was copied from the codered feature in #426 . That meant the p2.inf instruction in it is incorrect as it says it can update codered:

https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/4982fd8e7b129e9c8c33ba30f1f9fb5392abc4f3/features/org.eclipse.embedcdt-feature/p2.inf#L10

Since this feature didn't exist before 6.0.0, the p2.inf's update line quoted above can just be removed.

After creating a new debug configuration and starting it, eclipse show an error. openocd exited with (1). See openocd console for details.

BUT the console is empty.

Running openocd with the -s and -f parameter from the workspace directory works. Driver gets loaded and the connection opened. So openocd is working properly (It worked already with an orlder version of the MCU eclipse plugin - before and after the risc-v got included into the plugin)

Even with the arguments quoted, it works:

```
openocd -c ""gdb_port 3333"" -c ""telnet_port 4444"" -c ""tcl_port 6666"" -s ""D:/bin/openocd/scripts"" -f ""board/stm32f4discovery.cfg""

```

But with the echo it doesn even do enything


```
openocd -c ""gdb_port 3333"" -c ""telnet_port 4444"" -c ""tcl_port 6666"" -s ""D:/bin/openocd/scripts"" -f ""board/stm32f4discovery.cfg"" -c ""echo 'Started by GNU MCU Eclipse'""

```


Then I put the path to openocd to the PATH env variable. Didn't help with eclipse.

After replacing openocd with echo it prints the following into console:

```
-c gdb_port 3333 -c telnet_port 4444 -c tcl_port 6666 -s D:/bin/openocd/scripts -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg -c echo Started by GNU MCU Eclipse
```

That shows that it gets called without any quotes.

After doing a search I found an article, complaining about the same problem from 2016, so I copied the newest version of openocd to my drive, to check whether the new version behaves diefferently (old version was 2020-05-03). The old version was from the same site too.

Nope. Same problem.

It takes a while and then create a new c/c++ project
select managed c++ build, leave the path empty

Then go into window preferences and configure the global paths under MCU.


Here some differences:
With 4.16, even compiling the empty project will at least list the include files in the project explorer
With 4.18 not

Now create a simple main.c with just int main(void) and _exit in it and compile. Gcc will complain about exit but generates an elf.

Then create an debug configuration gdb openocd debugging.
Configure the board with -f ""board/stm32f4discovery.cfg"" (any other script will work) and click on debug

With 4.16 the debug console opens with red text and openocd is running
With 4.18 the console is not opening and it complains with exit code 1

Besides that I woke up in times when you installed your OS from diskettes and I hate to download a ton of megabytes, install it, already knowing that i dont need it. So i start a barebone platform and install only the plugins i need. Especially working in teams with multiple languages like python, php and c makes managing and distributing the development environment easier. Since only one folder (besides the binaries like gcc) need to be copied.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTM5MjkzMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have also stumbled over the openOCD problem with quotes and also found this old issue #12

After a lot of try and error I have found a solution:

TL;DR shared configuration file with linux line ending works, configuration file with windows line endings end with error `Unexpected command line argument: Started by GNU MCU Eclipse`.

I am working with eclipse on Windows and the starting situation was, that I was continueing work on an existing project. When I tried to debug with openOCD the debug session ends with the error 
````
xPack OpenOCD x86_64 Open On-Chip Debugger 0.11.0+dev (2022-09-01-17:58)
Licensed under GNU GPL v2
For bug reports, read
        http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html
Unexpected command line argument: Started by GNU MCU Eclipse
````

I was wondering what the problem is, because I have another project with working debug configuration. So to make sure that some hidden configuration is not the problem, I had created a new debug configuration. Set all needed configuration values as used in the working debug configuration. But still the problem persists.

I had started testing starting openOCD from command line and the problem happen there also. When running openOCD with `... -c 'echo ""Started by GNU MCU Eclipse""'` also the same error message occur, as when run in eclipse. After multiple test I choose to test with escaping the double quotes and this is working: `... -c ""echo \""Started by GNU MCU Eclipse\""""`

So it seems single quotes are not supported by windows command line (cmd). But I have found no way to change how the echo command is appended by the eclipse plugin. So why the other project is working???

Both projects are using shared files for debug configuration and so I have compared both. The diff program shows that only the project names differ AND the line ending. After changing the line ending of the debug configuration file both debug configurations are working 😃 

So it seems when creating a new debug configuration on windows eclipse is creating a configuration with windows line ending (independant if shared or local file is used), but the plugin is only working with linux line endings.

Hope this helps and you can get rid of your problem, too.

*Edit* It seems after the debug configuration is working, also changing the line ending back to windows \r\n does not trigger the issue. So it seems the issue occur only when creating or improting the debug configuration the first time.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7286GkIAy/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I thought that the recommendation was that the xPack Windows Build Tools be used in this context in which case the BusyBox implementation of `sh` would be used instead of the Windows Command Shell `cmd`, and this would probably eliminate the problem that you're experiencing?

The plugin will use the xPack Windows Build Tools BusyBox `sh` if things are configured as I believe is recommended on Windows.

are installed even when CMSIS packs are not selected for install. You can find the versions in ""Help"" -> ""About Eclipse Platform"" -> ""Installation Details"" -> ""Plug-Ins"". Or by extraction of the jar files in the ""plugins"" subfolder where you have extracted the zip file with the platform.

This tab of the this dialog basically shows all versions of all jar files in the plugins/dropins folder.

New logic was added to the toolbar button to make it visible only for C/C++ projects (having the `org.eclipse.cdt.core.cnature` nature).

Unfortunately the current code in the managed build (Arm & RISC-V) UI plug-ins have a dependency on the packs UI plug-in, which also display the CMSIS Packs perspective, and hiding this perspective completely requires moving the perspective code to a separate plug-in.

I created #489 to track this issue, to be addressed in a future release.

Yes. As you described. BTW I do not have any packs installed. So the packs view maybe empty correctly.

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

I dropped the Windows Build Tools and RISC-V GCC toolchain into this to allow me to work with RISC-V projects.

I created a Makefile (not a Managed Make) RISC-V project

![Image 198](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14550604/123622174-d8478780-d803-11eb-8129-3f7f26ba5da4.png)

and added a Makefile containing the following:

```
all:
	$(info This is my Makefile)
```

I built the project and got this:

```
11:05:56 **** Incremental Build of configuration Default for project test ****
make all 
This is my Makefile
make: 'all' is up to date.

11:05:56 Build Finished. 0 errors, 0 warnings. (took 349ms)
```

All good so far.

I then went to _Main Menu > Window > Preferences > C/C++ > Build > Build Variables_ and defined `${cross_make}` there:

I saved this and then tried to build the project again expecting it to fail because it should attempt to call `foobar` instead of `make` but it actually still calls `make` and works fine.

My understanding is that the Makefile project should inherit the `${cross_make}` vairable defined at the ""global"" level but it does not.

Note that `${cross_make}` is **not** defined at the project level which would override any ""global"" setting.

I should have said that the reason that I logged it against Embedded CDT and not CDT itself is that I cannot see any mention of `${cross_make}` in the latter. For example, using Eclipse for C/C++ Developers 2021-06:

It is somehow usual that CDT remembers the last contents of some fields and offers them as defaults when creating new instances, so this might explain why the `${cross_make}` string was present in that use case not specific to Embedded CDT.

I have never seen ${cross_make} before so I assume it is defined in a plugin.xml of one of the plugins of Embedded CDT
The way I think it works is that IBuilder.getCommand returns the string representation in the plugin.xml (if not overwritten in the gui) and is then run in the os.
I don't know whether CDT dumps the environment variables in the os or tries to expand them before executing the command.
As Sloeber heavily relies on environment variables including global variables and I never had global variables excluded. I would expect one of the 2 following to be the problem
1) cdt tries to expand the command before executing ignoring the global variables
2) Something else is wrong causing an exception resulting in a not properly expanded environment variable

I tried to locate if/where cdt expands the command but  IBuilder.getCommand is used at so many places it is ""confusing to me""

Indeed, it is defined by the Arm & RISC-V managed build plug-ins, and is implemented as a `class ConfigurationBuildMacroSupplier` that implements `IConfigurationBuildMacroSupplier`.

It gets the value from the toolchain definition. For non-managed projects it probably returns a null value.

If I understand Tommy's issue correctly, it should also check the C/C++ -> Build -> Build Variables.

I currently don't have a quick fix at hand, if someone can provide some hits, preferably as a pull request, it would make things faster.

@ilg-ul
I'm not using IConfigurationBuildMacroSupplier so I can't comment on that. 
I'm using IConfigurationEnvironmentVariableSupplier and IProjectEnvironmentVariableSupplier and both have their variables appear in the environment variables not the build.
They are made known to CDT in the plugin.xml

I see the build macro supplier is just underneath on the picture above.
I do not know why there is a build and environment variable concept and I do not know how they relate.
I think it is very confusing because when I turn on ""show system variables"" in preferences->C/C++->Build->build variables CDT shows me all system environment variables and others.
I project properties->C/C++ build->Environment the os environment variables are also shown.

`cross_make` is a special variable, its value is provided by a class, dynamically at run time, using a custom logic, which, at this moment, does not include looking in the manually defined build variables or environment variables.

This implementation obviously can be improved; if someone is willing to contribute a better logic, we'll consider it.

IMHO it should not. The current code is as I would expect it and works as I would expect it.

>But it does look at the manually defined variables in the project properties - just not those defined at the ""global scope""?

IMHO I guess iit works as follows
->resolve at workspace scope (= global scope)
->resolve at project scope
->resolve at toolchain scope
->resolve at configuration scope

later resolving overwrites previous resolving. Basically embedded CDT uses and controls ""cross_make"". My advice: use it the way embedded CDT has planned to use it or use a different variable name.

I don't see how it's merely confusion/misunderstanding to expect `${cross_make}` (and others) to behave like any other variable and take its value from the global scope if not defined at the project scope? This ""problem"" of where the variable gets its value seems real to me and my understanding was that @ilg-ul agreed?

Also - not being able to define it at global scope so that it is used at the project level means that the default value cannot be overridden externally using, for example. an INI file passed from the `eclipse.ini` file using `-pluginCustomization`.

Eclipse for C/C++ Developers also has these (under both _Windows > Preferences > C/C++ > Build_ and _Project Properties > C/C++ Build_) so they are not specific to Embedded CDT. Maybe this helps explain them?

Good point. I had assumed that the following in an ini file referenced by `-pluginCustomization` in the `eclipse.ini` file would do it but so far I have not managed to do so - maybe this is another case of settings that cannot be overridden in this way after all? In my experience some settings can be overridden this way and others cannot.

Hi,

I've created a project with multiple build configurations. The project was originally created with Risc-V target, and then I've added a build configuration with ARM (Cortex-M). The build configuration for ARM is not fully supported. At the Project properties / ""C/C++ Build"" / ""Settings"" / ""Toolchains"" tab is a limited version is displayed without ""Create Flash Image"" and ""Print Size"" checkboxes.

The build basically works for the ARM, but without creating HEX file or printing the size of the compiled project.

If you create a new project with ARM first then the ARM is fully supported and the Risc-V build will be somewhat limited.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a C/C++ Managed Project with ""Risc-V Cross GCC""
2. Add a new build configuration ""ARM TEST"", and set the toolchain to ""Arm Cross GCC""
3. Select the ""ARM TEST"" build configuration, and go to the Project properties / ""C/C++ Build"" / ""Settings"" / ""Toolchains"" tab

**Expected behaviour:** there should be the ""Create Flash Image"" and ""Print Size"" checkboxes.

**Actual behaviour:** they are not there...

### Versions

* [plug-in version]  6.1.2.202102181132
* [Eclipse version] 19-06, 21-09 (4.21)
* [Java version] OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04)

Inside the org.eclipse.embedcdt.debug.gdbjtag.ui.MemoryBlockMonitor::addMemoryBlock function  class we are creating an extended memory block, which is returning an object of PeripheralMemoryBlockExtension class. But in the constructor of PeripheralMemoryBlockExtension a new job (UpdatePeripheralRenderingJob) is created and scheduled (which runs in a different thread) which add the values to the Peripheral nodes. Parallely the UI thread will populate UI elements. Since the node values are populated in a different thread sometimes the values are not populated correctly. But when I updated the code so as to make the UI thread to wait until the UpdatePeripheralRenderingJob to get completed, the UI is showing proper values.

We have the main UI thread (U) which creates a rendering job (run in a different thread T). This rendering job is actually setting the values to the PeripheralRegisterVMNode nodes. So once a peripheral register is selected.

u1. Thread U will schedule the job for thread T.
u2. Then U will be creating the controls for PeripheralRendering (ie: in Memory view).
u3. After creating the controls thread U will set the current values.
u4. Then it will add the class PeripheralRendering to the Debug event Listeners.

(Once a DebugEvent is obtained the PeripheralRendering class will refresh the Memory UI correponding to a Peripheral register. This is what is happening during a suspend event.)
During the completion process of the rendering job thread T will fire a DebugEvent which we expect the PeripheralRendering class to handle. But since U and T are different threads there is no guarantee that T is firing the Debug event after step u4 (mentioned above). If T fires the debug event before u4 PeripheralRendering class will not get the debug event and so it will not refresh value changes made by T. This is actually what is happening in this case. When I added several logs this is the conclusion I got. If T completes setting the node values before step u3 then also it will have the proper values. If T is setting the values to the node before u3, in this case also it should work fine. But this also we can't guarantee since both are different threads.
So ideally we need to ensure that PeripheralRendering class should be handling any missed DebugEvent (already we have filtering based on Memory block source). Any missed DebugEvent between u2 and u4 should be handled (which will just refresh the UI with new PeripheralRegister node values) after all the controls are initialised.
This could be done by adding the PeripheralRendering class to the Debug event Listeners initially itself, then cache the events received before creating the controls and process these events after the control are created. Already the PeripheralRendering class is handling the DebugEvents whose source is the memory block corresponding to this class.

Just scheduling the fRefreshJob at the end of PeripheralRendering::createControl method fixed the issue. @ilg-ul Please add your suggestions.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285AjRXB/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Getting a new version into Orbit should be easy enough - I can help do that, or even better we can make the updates so that we can consume content directly from Maven central. The latter has benefits long term, but more effort now.

However there is still the issue of https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.embedcdt.core/lib/jackson-databind-2.9.9.3.jar being in this repo, so some refactoring is needed to make sure we are pulling this from external bundle and remove this jar from embedcdt. We could update the embedded jar, but that would be less ideal.

@lapnd I can help guide you through this process / review the changes.

Hi,

Accessing the url with a browser give ""no such page"".

Is there any other way to get the Keil.STM32F1xx_DFP.2.4.0.pack available in Eclipse?

TIA

The write-only registers(The access type information available in the peripheral register file) attempt to read values from UI when the peripheral register views are opened.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run an Arm GDB Launch.
2. Enable the peripheral register view.
3. Keep a register with ""access"" as ""write-only"" in the SVD Register file.
Eg: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69203453/175908727-9ae82b47-93b6-4ca3-94b7-0c422bd6a44f.png)
5. Try to open the register with access write-only.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
It shouldn't read the ""write-only"" register values.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
The write-only registers attempt to read values from UI causing the target to go for an exception.

### Description
Setting a break point on Reset_Handler seems to stall at fpu init and not going to main using Jlink with cortex m7, however if I specify the program counter at the right address of the main , then I see the starting up going through. To illustrate this,  I am setting a break point in my reset handler, as shown in below picture
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13626231/188572610-fd0d54f8-8d11-4e1c-9df5-f38b53452110.png)

The reset handler is defined as per

```C
void Reset_Handler( void )
{

    rfeMPU_init();

    rfeSwStartup_enableFPU();

    main( 0, 0 );
}
```
What I observe is that the debugger seems to stall in the fpu init, hitting the resume button doesn't help and same debug message is printed in the Console ( beneath correspond to two clicks on resume button)

Sorry I don't know what you mean, I have put in the ticket the debugger stack already, that is the first thing that happens after flashing the board

What does _""specify the program counter at the right address of main""_ mean?

Do you mean that your program doesn't execute correctly if you put an initial breakpoint at `Reset_Handler` but does if you put the initial breakpoint at `main()`?

Is the whole program in and executing from flash?
If you're flashing the program using some flash tool before debugging and then debugging it from flash then why do you have the debug launch configuration loading the executable to the target at debug startup?
Is there any relocation/copying of code from flash to RAM during the program initialization?
Is `Reset_Init` your only startup code? Is there nothing else? For example to initialize BSS/zero init memory, heap (if used), copy static initialized data etc.?

It means that if I go to `Startup` >> `Ru/Restart Commands` and I fill in the box of `Set Program counter at (hex)` with the program counter of my application, which I obtain looking at the assembly code addresses; then, after rebooting I see who the debug trace shows the program breaking at the _main_ as I expect.

> Do you mean that your program doesn't execute correctly if you put an initial breakpoint at `Reset_Handler` but does if you put the initial breakpoint at `main()`?

Nope, in both cases the the inital breakpoint is not pointing to the right code section, it is breaking at `Target halted (DBGRQ, PC = 0x00011F9C)` which is the address of the init of the FPU in my cortex-m7

Yes, I am flashing it with Jlink as described in the documentaion, for defining the areas of memory I am using this scatter file for clang

This is exactly the point, I want to use the symbolic name `main`, but after the .elf is loaded on the M7, this main is not pointing to my expected main which is defined in `reset handler ` function that I shared but it starts at the FPU init

What happens if you debug/single instruction step from the very start of your program? That is, don't use a breakpoint at all and don't let the debugger run the program at startup.

Thanks for the pointers, I will take a look into the reset_init as you mentioned above. I am sure that the project build is fine and the image too, because I have tried exactly same build environment and .elf with Lauterbach + Lauterbach eclipse plugin and there it works correctly.

1. If the program is being programmed to flash before debugging then remove the load of the program to the target from the debug launch configuration. At best it's unnecessary but at worst it could cause problems if the debugger attempts to do normal memory writes to a flash area of the memory map.
2. Check the symbolic info using a map or list file or even by just printing using the GDB console interface. For example, `p/x main` and `p/x Reset_Handler`.
3. Remove the continue from the debug launch configuration, don't set any breakpoint, and single step from the very start to see where/how/why execution fails.
4. Double check that, if you're debugging the program from flash, that the debugger is not trying to use soft breakpoints (where it saves the breakpoint instruction and temporarily overwrites it with a `BKPT` instruction - something that will generally not work directly with flash) but is using hardware breakpoints.
5. Check all debugging logs for any errors/anomalies.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285J2XPq/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes. If the program is already in flash and being run/debugged from there then the debugger should not be trying to load it to the target. Uncheck the _Load executable_ option.

As I said already, list/map files, and maybe also using the `nm` binutil (if you're using a GCC toolchain - other toolchains should have an equivalent tool).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285J2onQ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It doesn't. Cortex-M CPUs do this automatically.
At startup/post reset they load `$sp` with `$VTOR[0]` and `$pc` with `$VTOR[4]`.
Some (early?) cores don't have a `$VTOR` in which case it's effectively `0x00000000`.

VTOR = Vector Table Offset Register.

No. That allows the debugger to access memory regions that are not defined in the linker script. If you set that `on` then you'd have to describe the full memory map, including memory mapped peripherals etc., in the linker script.

* https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Memory-Region-Attributes.html#Memory-Access-Checking

It's very common for this to be set to `off` for embedded targets. Having it `on` probably makes sense for native development on Linux, Windows, Mac etc. which is probably why the default is `on` given that native debugging is the most common case?

The target is Cortex-M7 I believe? That being the case, I would initialise the `$VTOR` via gdb commands in the debug launch configuration. That will ensure that `$sp` and `$pc` are initialised correctly (the latter will probably be also taken care of by the program load) but also that interrupts that fire when running/debugging from RAM are vectored correctly and not via possibly garbage data at `0x00000000`.

If you're compiling your program for RAM at `0x20000000`, and running/debugging it from there, then that screenshot suggests that your vector table is not correctly set up. It shows `0x20000000` containing the byte value `0x01` which doesn't look like a valid least significant byte for the initial `$sp` which should normally be word (or 8 or 16 byte?) aligned and located towards/at the top of the available RAM.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285Kdk-6/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Indeed, I did that and I found two different things
1. The compiler I am using is clang so I am trying ensure whether the gdb I am using (GNU) is fully compatible or not
2. I noticed that my project startup `.S` for clang is not complete so I am trying to get an example of how that should look like for clang.

I was referring to symbols not being loading properly for instance, optimization flags not well aligned or so...

Also debugging a bit more if I skip Eclipse and I do see that running JlinkGDB server + arm-gdb-client no issue, it seems to work as expected, only when going via the plugin seems not to work with me.

In your place I would first try to compile the project with the latest arm-none-eabi-gcc, to be sure the startup is correct, and then, with a functional project, migrate it to clang.

And, when encountering strange errors while debugging in Eclipse, I would try the same binaries in a plain arm-none-eabi-gdb, running in a terminal.

Also very useful to understand the debugger behaviour is the trace tab, which you probably have to enable explicitly somewhere in the debugger settings.

Yes it does, and I cannot find so far an example of that. For instance entries like `.arch` are not supported any more or not like that, left is clang right is gcc

If the problem is with debugging and, in particular, problems with setting/using breakpoints at the start of the programme, then you really should be focusing on the ELF file, its contents, and its symbolic debug info, first. Comparing generated assembly code for gcc versus clang seems like a waste of time to me. Obviously they're going to be different but that alone is of no obvious consequence. I previously, a long time back, mentioned ways to examine the ELF file contents but you seem to have ignored those suggestions.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285YMUDc/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

2. The xPack tools I installed was recognized with the new 6.3.1.
3. I then created a new Blinky project, I see that the `syscalls.c` still has `(ptr)->__sdidinit)`. 
4. I have not patched up the files yet. I am still in the process trying to figure out where the original files are saved. Before installing 6.3.1, I thought the original `syscalls.c` file was part of 6.3.1. Now that you have fixed the issue in the repo, but I still have this issue, I am not sure where it came now.

Debugging is not working with GDB 13 on Windows (not tested on other plateforms).

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install a fresh Eclipse for C/C++ Embedded developpers, latest version + ARM GCC 12.2 from ARM website.
2. Create a sample project for STM32F4xx, Hello World version, compile it.
3. Create a new Debug configuration, for example GDB SEGGER J-Link Debugging, setup the device type + .elf file, leave the default options.
4. Start debugging.

**Expected behaviour:** GBD Eclipse client is working like on the previous GDB versions (for example, there is no problem with GDB 10.1.90).

**Actual behaviour:** Eclipse is stuck on the ""Configuring GDB..."" step.

arm-none-eabi-gdb is indeed started with the usual command line (--interpreter=mi2 --nx).
the JLinkGDBServer is waiting for a TCP connection.

The gdb traces console shows this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26653899/198853539-87728cdf-5c04-4c55-8de5-051110af60ce.png)

Nothing more happens. There is no CPU use at all, Eclipse is just waiting here. The GDB client will never connect to the GDB server, the program is not loaded / started.

However, the GDB arm-none-eabi-gdb client is actually working perfectly when using it from the command line.

Where did you get your GDB 13 pre-release from? Does the problem also occur with GDB 12.1?

The MI trace you have provided is showing an error in GDB itself, the `3-gdb-show language` is not getting a proper response. It should be `3^done,value=""auto""` but the `3` is missing. Therefore CDT doesn't know that the answer is to `3-gdb-show language`. Since GDB is never responding (as far as CDT knows) the launch is hung trying to configure.

Please let me know where you got GDB from, ideally including the commit it was built from, so we can identify how to formulate a bug report to GDB ahead of their release.

When I run in the console I do see that GDB detects an exception condition ([this is where it is detected](https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/60095ba3b8f8ba26a6389dded732fa446422c98f/gdbsupport/event-loop.cc#L558)) - I think that exception is because of EOF on input, but not sure.

Regardless, the error seems to be on the read side, consider this where the `5` is missing. The command is shortened because if the full `groups` is there then the error is not seen

I am using Windows 10 machine. I tried debugging and found like we have a call to **System.getenv()** in **XpackUtils::getSysRepoBasePaths**. The **System.getenv()** call give a map which has all keys in UPPER CASE. And because of which **env.get(""ProgramFiles"")** is returning null and finally resulting in the NPE when passed to org.eclipse.core.runtime.Path constructor. So I think if we try to fetch the ""ProgramFiles"" variable using **System.getenv(""ProgramFiles"")** it will be giving the correct path (since this call is case insensitive).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285UYMPi/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Existing projects (created using previous embedCDT) using old toolchain id shows error after imported to IDE updated with new embed cdt (6.3.1). When importing exiting projects  The toolchain used was ""RISC-V GCC/Newlib"". And the toolchain path defined (via ini file) is `org.eclipse.embedcdt.managedbuild.cross.riscv.core/toolchain.path.2032619395=${eclipse_home}/../toolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin` And the .cproject file is having the toolchain id options saved as :

`<option id=""ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross.riscv.option.toolchain.id.437584809"" superClass=""ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross.riscv.option.toolchain.id"" useByScannerDiscovery=""false"" value=""-2032619395"" valueType=""string""/>`

Earlier I hope we were using the toolchain.name option and it's hash for identifying the path it was working fine. But now when we changed that to use toolchain.id we are not able to detect the path configured. When I tried to debug the issue I found like **org.eclipse.embedcdt.managedbuild.cross.core.preferences.PersistentPreferences::getKeyId** (from line 109 `keyId = Long.parseLong(toolchainId.trim());`) is returning the value directly from the option (in .cproject) which will be negative value (-2032619395 saved in existing project). Would it be better to change that to return Absolute value (like how we are mapping toolchain name to id). I tried changing the line to `keyId = Math.abs(Long.parseLong(toolchainId.trim()));` and it's working fine. Is it good for us to keep this so as to have the backward compatility?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/551/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If you still have old projects and this change allows to import them, sure, we can consider it. The only concern is to not affect other projects. Are you sure that new projects, created with embedCDT, cannot have negative values there?

Yes after import if we are changing the toolchain manually the .cproject is getting updated with correct (new toolchain) and everything working fine.

May be I will just try to have a call to `PersistentPreferences::getToolchainPath(String toolchainName, IProject project)` [from inside `PersistentPreferences::getToolchainPath(String toolchainId, String toolchainName, IProject project)`] [as a second level call for backward compatibility] [the current deprecated function] if we are not getting the path resolved using toolchainId and toolchainName. I will add this change for my product, since we have a quite number of existing projects which has to be supported :(.

1. Create an example RISC-V project - SiFive HiFive1 blinky
2. Try to compile
3. Compilation fails with the errors below.

19:26:02 Build Failed. 4 errors, 0 warnings. (took 2s.226ms)
```
**Workaround**

1. Add `_zicsr` to the _Other extensions_ settings (_Project > Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings > Target Processor > Other extensions_). To be completely correct `_zicsr_zidfencei` should be added but the `zifencei` extensions is not relevant for this specific project.

**Explanation**

1. As some time in the recent past the RISC-V tools moved from one standard for RISC-V architecture strings to another, a canonical one. This means that what used to simply be specified as, say, `rv32gc` is now properly specified as `rv32gd_zicsr` or maybe `rv32gc_zicsr_zifencei`. 
2. I spoke to @ilg-ul about this and he said that some or all RISC-V project templates will need to be updated to add the required _Other extensions_ project settings to match the latest RISC-V toolchain and ensure that the projects compile and link out of the box. Unfortunately this will mean that newer project templates will not work with older toolchains until the relevant _Other extensions_ are removed from the project settings.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/553/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I can see milestone 6.3.2 without open issues, but it is not released yet. Should we add this issue to 6.3.2 as well or do you prefer to release the current state first?

OK, but you need to determine if the issue is due to the toolchain rather than the Embedded CDT plugins.

As you can see here, using the set of tools that I listed earlier - including the latest xPack RISC-V embedded GCC - the opcodes are displaying correctly.

So, I can only infer that the original issue is due to the use of the different toolchain:

Since I don't know how the custom toolchain was built, I can't provide much help with it. 

But if I'd had to diagnose this, I would do the following: 

- install a fresh Eclipse Embedded CDT in a new folder
- create a new workspace
- instantiate the Hello World RISC-V QEMU xPack C/C++ Project (for more info, see <https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/templates/hello-world-qemu-xpack/>)
- (wait for the RISC-V toolchain to download, if not pre-loaded, as the documentation instructs)) 
- run a debug session via QEMU 

If the opcodes are shown, this is a confirmation that the Eclipse environment is ok.

Then import the actual project, configure the custom toolchain, and retry the debug session. 

If it works as expected (and as proved before), you most probably had a problem with the Eclipse environment. 

If the problem persist, the probability to have a problem with the toolchain is pretty high.

Hope it helps.

and configured the template RISC-V project to use that instead of the xPack one and I was also able to see the opcodes in the Disassembly view using that setup.

Maybe the issue is with this specific toolchain (I don't know where it is available) and/or Windows or something?

To summarise:

1. Should ""CMSIS Packs"" rather than also ""CMSIS packs"" etc. be used consistently?
2. The _CMSIS Packs_ view initially says ""(no packages) - Press the Refresh button to register all available packages"" but the relevant button in the view toolbar (left arrow above right arrow) is called _Update the CMSIS packs definitions_ according to the tooltip.
3. The use of terms ""refresh"", ""register"" and ""update"" are a bit confusing. I think that the _Update the CMSIS packs definitions_ toolbar button causes the master index (or indices if there are multiple CMSIS Packs repositories configured?) to be downloaded so that thereafter the _CMSIS Packs_ view has a local list of CMSIS Packs and where to find them etc.? CMSIS Packs are not themselves downloaded unless/until the user explicitly clicks on them and selects _Install_? That being the case the nomenclature should probably more accurately describe/reflect the operations that take place and should be consistent.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/566/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Understood. These changes are API-compatible with your current target definition and will have no effect (other than providing an unused CDT build variable) when deployed against CDT versions preceding 11.2.0 M2.

In the Debugger tab I can choose the GDB, Telnet and Tcl ports, this is fine and it configures the ports when OpenOCD is invoked.
However I cannot choose a different port GDB number but the one that is specified in the option above.
The use case is related to multicore devices with different (and consecutive ports) for the different cores, e.g. core 1 port 3333, core 2 port 3334, and so on.
At the moment I can only connect to the core 1, i.e. port 3333 and if I specify 3334 as GDB port, it will connect to port 3334 but this will still be the 1st core, with 2nd core having port 3334 and so on. 
If I deselect the flag ""Start OpenOCD locally"" then for sure I can specify the exact port I want GDB to connect to but with the hassle to start OpenOCD manually.

It would be nice to have the possibility to specify the actual GDB port.
I tried to use -ex ""target extended-remote localhost:3334"" as ""other options"" but it does not work.

Surely this behaviour is outside the scope of the plugin and dictated by something external?
Maybe you need a custom OpenOCD script in order to discriminate between different core targets?

I think you need to explain the issue in more detail - ideally with screenshots and logs - because I cannot see that it's obviously an issue with the plugin itself.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285ecb0c/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Please ignore the error, it is not important for what I want to describe.
As you can see when OpenOCD is launched, there are two gdb server ports: 3333 for the Cortex-A55 and 3334 for the Cortex-M33.
There is no way for me to select the Cortex-M33 and port 3334.
If I change this option:

to 3334 for example, I get this:

So no matter what I configure, I can never connect to the second gdb port.
Now, of course I know that I could try to change the OpenOCD configuration file, but I think it would be good to have the possibility to specify in the plugin to which of the listening ports gdb should connect to.

In other words, the ""Port Number"" here should be left configurable, also when the ""Start OpenOCD locally"" box is checked.
In fact if I change the GDB port to 3334 for instance, the same is reflected there:

That's not what I was suggesting.

1. Uncheck _Start OpenOCD locally_ **TEMPORARILY**
2. Change _Remote Target > Port number_ to 3334 - so GDB should use this

Yes - I think that would solve the problem. By default the port number should track the port in start openocd locally, but there should be a way to override it.

My understanding of the issue is:

1. OpenOCD as configured above and using the relevant script is started by the plugin and creates two GDB servers:
  * Port 3333 for the Cortex-A55
  * Port 3334 for the Cortex-M33
2. GDB as launched by the plugin will always connect to 3333 - or whatever is specified in _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_ even if _Remote Target > Port number_ is different (e.g. 3334)
3. The user wants to launch only a single debug session, have the plugin launch OpenOCD and GDB but connect to the second OpenOCD GDB server on 3334 - it looks like this is not possible as things stand.

The suggestion is to allow _Remote Target > Port number_ to always be edited even if _Start OpenOCD locally_ is checked, and have GDB launch using _Remote Target > Port number_  rather than _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_, thus allowing the port that GDB connects to to be configured.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285ec0fV/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If you want to start a single session, but not for the first core, you have to adjust your script to give you access to that core, and make openocd to listen on a single port, which you can configure in the plugin.

I have close to zero experience with openocd, so I have no idea how your script should be changed, but with J-Link, if I remember right, for multi core devices it was possible to start multiple GDB server instances, each with its port, configured for a separate core, and this simple use case was assumed for openocd too.
 
From Tommy's summary, I understand that you want to start openocd locally with a custom multi-port configuration, let it listen on multiple port, and do not disable the Remote Target fields (which prevents out of sync configurations for regular use cases), to allow the GDB client to connect to another port.

This can be done, but is it really a good solution? Why don't you use a separate script for the second core?

They want to start one - that connects to the ""second"" core target (Cortex-M33) for which OpenOCD creates a GDB server on port 3334.

> If you want to start a single session, but not for the first core, you have to adjust your script to give you access to that core, and make openocd to listen on a single port, which you can configure in the plugin.

That's one way to do it but invasive to the default target script.

> This can be done, but is it really a good solution?

I don't think that it's a bad solution.

As @jonahgraham said above, by default _Remote Target > Port number_ should match _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_, but the former is left editable (even if _OpenOCD Setup > Start OpenOCD locally_ is checked) and GDB is launched by the plugin using the former rather than the latter. That allows the flexibility that is needed here but doesn't impact anything else that I can think of.

In short the suggested changes to the plugin are:

1. Always have _Remote Target > Port number_ enabled/editable
2. Always launch GDB to connect to _Remote Target > Port number_ rather than _OpenOCD Setup > GDB Port_

Edit: actually there is a negative impact. Assume a single core target (forget about multiple cores and GDB servers). If the user decides to configure OpenOCD to start the GDB server on something other than 3333 then they need to change this in two places now - _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_ **AND** _Remote Target > Port number_. Unless changes to the former always change the latter but changes to the latter can be used to override the default? (And that may be what @jonahgraham was suggesting above!).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285edBF2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

At the moment, rather than introducing a new GUI element (_Remote Target > Use host name etc._ checkbox) I'd be more inclined to do this:

1. _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_ and _Remote Target > Port number_ default to 3333
3. Changes to _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_ are reflected/applied to _Remote Target > Port number_
4. Changes to _Remote Target > Port number_ override whatever was previously there (and are not reflected back to _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_)
5. _Remote Target > Port number_ is always enabled - even if _OpenOCD Setup > Start OpenOCD locally_ is enabled
6. GDB is always launched by the plugin using _Remote Target > Port number_ rather than (the de-facto situation when _OpenOCD Setup > Start OpenOCD locally_ is checked?) _OpenOCD Setup > GDB port_?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285edFji/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes - that is how I did it. Checkbox is always checked on new launches (i.e. doesn't use `fPersistentPreferences`), and is set back to checked if you toggle the start gdbserver to on as well.

Not sure what this means - please expand unless I addressed your issue in the above paragraph.

My only concern is about if/how any settings get persisted and applied to future launch configurations.
But the way that Eclipse plugins persist settings (or not) across instances has always been a mystery to me.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285edINy/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The mechanism of keeping persistent preferences, used by Eclipse in many places, is both helpful and annoying.

The annoying case would be when the user configures the remote target port 3334, runs a debug session, and the next day creates a regular launcher, for a simple device which starts openocd to listen only on 3333, and scratches his head why the plugin timeouts (and asks for support!).

Thus I would favour a solution which explicitly shows in the interface that the Remote Target is out of sync with the locally started server, and be sure this checkbox always defaults to a position that prevents this case.

The mystery is not that deep, most values in the graphical interface are saved as persistent preferences and used as defaults when the plugin creates a new instance of the corresponding object. 

In this case, a subsequent OpenOCD launcher will inherit most of the values of the previously created OpenOCD launcher, a subsequent QEMU launcher will inherit most of the values of the previously created QEMU launcher, etc.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285edMpU/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

### Steps to Reproduce

1. add openOCD plugin to a newly installed cdt environment
2. create a managed build project
3. right click the project in project properties

I would expect that this keeps the console clean.

That's expected, because they are not related in any way.

The selection you make in the _Default toolchain_ field will be proposed as default when you create new projects.

Why do you think that a setting named _Default XXX_ should have any effect on existing projects? 

Existing projects already have a toolchain, so they no longer require a default one.

I don't.
You're the one who keeps mentioning projects!

So the effect of changing the _Default toolchain_ dropdown here is that whatever is selected will be the default toolchain proposed when creating a new project?

The _two fields below_ actually can be pairs of multiple settings (name/paths) for all toolchains referred by the projects in the workspace.

For portability reasons, projects configurations do not use paths, but toolchain names (actually internal unique IDs).

These MCU Preferences pages allow to assign a path to each toolchain.

Hmmm...  @fanghuaqi take a look at the picture at https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/574#issuecomment-1597009531, since the pictures you used are not relevant; that Preferences page may list multiple toolchains, if multiple different projects are defined in your workspace.

OK,  @ilg-ul  I understand now, this screenshot above, the marked 1 and 2 have two different functions:

1. is used to select default toolchain
2. is used to set different toolchain and its default toolchain path, but why there are 2 listed in your screenshot and only 1 list in @laomaolaile 

Previously I thought 1 is used to select the toolchain, and 2 is used to set the selected toolchain path, but it seems that I am wrong.

Maybe a extra split line could be added between 1 & 2 or add more spaces before 1 & 2 to let user be confused.

That's correct

Not exactly. It lists the names of all toolchains used by the projects in the workspace, and allows to set a path for each of them.

> but why there are 2 listed in your screenshot and only 1 list in @laomaolaile

Because in my workspace there are two projects, each with its toolchain.

> Maybe a extra split line could be added between 1 & 2 or add more spaces before 1 & 2 to let user be confused.

That's a valid suggestion.

I was thinking on moving the default toolchain selection at the end, and somehow visually group the toolchains paths section.

@jonahgraham what do you think? In other preferences pages I saw grouping or tabs. What would be the best way to redesign these windows to avoid the confusion?

**Global Toolchains Paths** are actually stored in a special folder inside the Eclipse instance. **Workspace Toolchain Paths** are stored in a special folder inside the workspace. There are also **Project Toolchain Paths**, stored in the project folder.

> If I want to set each toolchain's global default path, how to archive it?

In the current design, paths are not portable between different platforms and even between different machines using the same platform, thus are not archivable, you have to configure them manually each time you setup a new Eclipse or workspace.

This issue is addressed by the new xPack design.

When you install the toolchain as recommended in the README page, you also get a line added to the `package.json`, which is archivable.

The toolchain is actually installed in a global folder, but links to it are added in the project. Eclipse knows to use these links, and so you have a portable way of automating toolchain paths.

I also added some additional information in the dialog.

For this example I have a workspace with three projects, _blinky_, _printer_ and _scanner_. _blinky_ and _printer_ have `Debug` and `Release` build config, and _scanner_ has those two, plus `New Board Debug` that uses a different toolchain.

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/assets/679236/7fd2dfb7-22a3-40ad-8fba-339992facc32)

As you can see I added:

- groups around the global and per-toolchain settings with labels
- whitespace between different toolchain settings
- new logic that shows which projects + build configs are using each displayed toolchain

If the workspace has no projects with suitable toolchains, this is what it looks like:

I think it is a good starting point. 👍 

As order, I would place the group with the default toolchain _after_ the list of toolchains. This setting actually does not belong here, since the pages are named _XXX Toolchains Paths_. From this point of view, probably using separate tabs would be more appropriate, since the default toolchain is not related to the list at all.

As small cosmetics:

- the 'On macOS...' notice should be moved inside the list group, possibly after an empty line
- a more explicit text for the default toolchain group might be 'Select the default toolchain to be used when creating new projects'
- for most projects all build configurations use the same toolchain; for such projects displaying the project name is enough; for complex projects, with different toolchains for different build configurations, the build configuration name may be an useful information

As far as moving the default toolchain dropdown to a new tab, that will have to be deferred to another day/issue.

I'm going to assume the above is ok and I will work on the other 5 tabs that display the same info.

It looks clear than before, in this screenshot the **Global** and **Workspace** are merged into one? So this settings will be saved in eclipse ide installation location or workspace settings? If saved in eclipse ide installation, if user don't have permission to write this eclipse ide installation location, how will it be handled?

And in the new look, will all the different workspace toolchain settings be displayed in this page, if the workspace contains many different toolchain path settings, will this page display them all?

Thanks for asking the questions - this stuff is pretty complicated and making it easier to understand for users is really important.

> Some questions list below:

The current UI allows you to set the path used by the toolchain, but to keep the UI from being very big, only the toolchains in use in your workspace are displayed here.

> 
> For the workspace preference, is it used to set the default toolchain path for each toolchain and overwrite the settings in global settings?

Yes that is correct. If you don't set anything in the workspace level the global level is used.

And for this new UI look, as screenshot below:

If in the workspace, it contains many projects, eg. 20 or more, this red marked placed may display a very very long text, is there any prevention idea here to avoid long text displayed here.

That's just another good reason why you should **not** install Eclipse in a system folder with administrative permissions.

Install it in your home folder; you'll have no problems with global preferences, and you'll also be able update it at your will.

Even more, if you are working on multiple projects requiring different sets of plug-ins, install multiple Eclipse instances, one for each project. This will allow you to update each Eclipse without possibly breaking other projects using different plug-ins.

Isn't it a prerequisite here that something like OpenOCD supports these features before the plugins can leverage/orchestrate them? Does it support them already? If not then adding support there would be a better place to start?

Edit: I guess that OpenOCD does support system bus access:

* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-openocd/blob/4be6a5683f9de5705c5d8a28f4ed9ada2250dccb/src/target/riscv/riscv.c#L4158

I can't see if access to registers - even using SBA - is possible while the target is still running. The debug spec suggests that it's only memory that can be accessed in this way:

I think that a first step is to clarifiy:

1. The capabilities provided by the RISC-V debug spec
2. The set of such capabilities supported (or not) by the current OpenOCD implementation

before considering what needs to be done to the plugins to provide support for the capabilities originally mentioned.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285gBAC4/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Hi @ilg-ul , this is a feature of riscv debug spec, as I know openocd[1], jlink [2] support it.

Hi @TommyMurphyTM1234 , openocd support it via config in openocd cfg file like `riscv set_mem_access sysbus`, but when we debug program in eclipse, and click run it, then you will not be able to view the expression value and memory content, other ide allow periodly monitor these values by a configured time such as 0.5s, but I didn't know how we can achive it in current plugin.

@ilg-ul can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that the plugins will only be able to exercise features that GDB allows to be used in the first place. 

Sounds to me like this is potentially a mini project that needs to consider some or all of the following - and maybe others - and not just the plugins:

1. RISC-V debug spec and debug capabilities - in particular what target resources are accessible via SBA while the target is free running
2. OpenOCD (and other GDB servers) support for these capabilities
3. GDB (and LLDB?) support for same
4. What capabilities other commercial/non open-source tools provide
5. Eclipse plugin support for these capabilities","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285gBHa2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That's correct.

Only if you can use a feature in a terminal we should consider changes to the debug plug-ins.

I agree. While such info about other tools may be interesting and informative, the key issue here is to first determine what, if any, support GDB has for the capabilities in question. If it doesn't have any then support would need to be added to GDB before the plugins can be modified to leverage those capabilities.

In this context, GDB features such as background execution and non-stop mode may be relevant:

* https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Background-Execution.html#Background-Execution

```java
IPath projectPath = project.getWorkspace().getRoot().getLocation().append(project.getFullPath());
IPath xpackBinPath = projectPath.append(""xpacks"").append("".bin"");

path.add(xpackBinPath.toOSString());

and suggested:

```java
String xpackBinPath = project.getFolder(""xpacks"").getFolder("".bin"").getLocation().toOSString();
path.add(xpackBinPath);

This should produce a correct path, even if the project is not stored in the workspace.

I tested this with a project created via the QEMU Arm xPack template outside the workspace and the build passed, so I guess this is ok.

* Hello. When a workspace path or folder name has an extended ASCII character within it (e.g. é - e with accent) , a GDB session fails to launch. 
* One of our customers has reported this problem and we've reproduced it, though the exception stacktraces are different. 
* The workaround is to use a workspace path with only ASCII characters.
* Thank you for the help!

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create workspace folder with extended ASCII character in the folder name, e.g. étudiant.
2. Launch Eclipse and switch to  workspace folder with extended ASCII character in the folder name.
3. Create project for device that uses Segger JLink GDB server
4. Launch GDB session for project with MCU development kit
5. Confirm GDB session fails to launch

**Expected behaviour:** GDB session launches successfully and user can debug application.

**Actual behaviour:** GDB session fails to launch with exceptions thrown. Please see the exceptions at bottom of this post.

### Versions

* Plug-ins version (Target Platform): CDT 10.5.0 / Embed CDT 6.1.2 (Note: J-Link plugins are used primarily)
* Eclipse version: 4.23
* Java version: JDK 17.0.6 Amazon Correto / Plug-ins execute with JavaSE-11
* Operating system: Windows 10 (language: English US)
* Toolchain version: ARM GNU GCC v10.3.1

Coincidentally I have just been looking at a [similar issue](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/cdt-gdb-adapter/issues/275) and see that CDT has numerous places where, when communicating with GDB, there are encoding differences that are not properly accounted for. For example, even if you manage to launch you are likely to hit other problems such as setting breakpoints in such files.

It is likely that this is the workaround that will be needed for a while. However we can get a proper solution faster if you can contribute some PRs?

The other mitigation that is employed by some vendors is to prevent creation of projects with non-ASCII characters in the first place.

### Questions & Answers
> Can you supply the [gdb traces](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt/tree/main/FAQ#ive-been-asked-for-gdb-traces-where-can-i-find-them) of the issue please?

Please see the GDB traces at the bottom of this post.

> For example, even if you manage to launch you are likely to hit other problems such as setting breakpoints in such files.

Yes, we've encountered such scenarios as well. One that we're reproduced is after GDB launches successfully, it cannot display source code because the SourceLocator failed with workspace path that has extended ASCII characters.

>However we can get a proper solution faster if you can contribute some PRs?

I can try. Where are the instructions for applying for CDT committer status? Does CDT committer status extend to Eclipse Embed CDT, or are they separate?

Looks like encoding of the `é` is inconsistent and therefore it comes out wrong. This is the same issue as https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/1998 for VSCode and there the workaround was to ensure Windows is set to UTF-8 - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/1998#issuecomment-1315933181 - interestingly vscode-cpptools have closed the issue pointing back at fixes needed in GDB. @TommyMurphyTM1234's question is quite relevant here, if you cannot do the `-environment-cd` when running gdb outside of Eclipse (in MI mode), then there isn't anything we can do in CDT.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285hPnKj/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I see your point.
* The GDB client we are using is version `10.2.90.20210621-git`, which we obtained from `GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 10.3-2021.10`.
* I tried your suggestion of using GDB outside of Eclipse. I launched the GDB client on command line with arguments `--interpreter=mi --nx`. Then I ran the `file <path_to_program>` command to load the program from command line, but it fails to handle the path with extended ASCII characters, resulting in error `No such file or directory.`.  See command line output further below.
* I'll try upgrading the GDB client to a newer version to see if that resolves the issue.

GNU ARM Embedded seems to have stopped at 10.2

Then I ran the `file <path_to_program>` command to load the program from command line, but it fails to handle the path with extended ASCII characters, resulting in error `No such file or directory.`.  See command line output further below.

So it sounds like GDB itself also (?) has problems handling ""extended"" characters?
So there may be several layers of tools that need to be updated to deal with this which is probably not a trivial task.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7285hVGbC/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* Sorry to take so long to reply. I got sidetracked with other tasks.
* I also tried the latest GDB client `arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe` from [arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads) and get the same error `No such file or directory.`. Below is the the console output.
* @TommyMurphyTM1234 Thanks for the suggestion to use @ilg-ul's xPack toolchain. I get the same error using GDB client `arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe` within `xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-12.2.1-1.2-win32-x64`. Below is the console output.
* At this point, we'll have to rely on the workarounds (1. use paths with only ASCII chars 2. [Enable Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/1998)  )  until this is fixed in the GDB client.

Negative. The CMSIS-Pack manager can use multiple repos to download packs.

Just create a conforming index and add it to the CMSIS-Pack manager configuration.

> it seem to be impossible to manually install a .pack file

I did not check recently, but the initial CMSIS specs did not define such a use case, so packs can be installed only via an index file.

I did not check, but it might be possible to place the index locally and pass a uri like `file://...`.

But what do you need the CMSIS-Packs for? Apart from the documentation, the plug-ins do not use the .pdsc definitions at all.

For the SVDs, you can directly refer them from the debug plug-ins, you do not need the entire package for this.

Yes, this was a nice feature, and initially it made sense assuming the .pdsc files can be used for other purposes too.

But later it proved less suitable, and instead of managing the huge CMSIS packages (some take hundreds of MBs), it looked simpler to just copy the .svd files into the projects and pass them to the debugger directly.

Also the permanent timeouts of the servers hosting the packages and the out-of-sync Keil index were some negative factors that contributed to the CMSIS Packs plug-ins to be no longer actively developed.

Adding a checkbox in Settings -> Linker -> Libraries, this checkbox is used to control group libraries or not
- [ ] Group libraries(-Wl,start-group $LIBS -Wl, end-group)

When this checkbox is clicked, the generated Makefile will be like this:

This feature is used to fix issue like this `If a symbol in that archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker would not be able to resolve that reference.`

I created a MinGW GCC project using eclipse-embedcpp-2023-12-R-win32-x86_64, which already supports the Group libraries feature.

If want the risc-v project to also support Group libraries, do need to complete some development work?

If I want to achieve it and contribute, what should I do?

yeah, but the behaviour is also slightly different. and it is not widely used by CDT, probably it is Windows specific, since I don't see it on my Mac.

But it can be started in the shell with the same commands and parameters. 

My OpenOCD will eventually run to the server_loop(), blocked by select(), which is consistent with the official openocd. In my testing, after the CDT called openocd, my openocd did indeed run to the server_loop().

Strangely, when OpenOCD runs to the server_loop(), it indicates that OpenOCD has already connected to the device and is waiting for GDB to communicate with it through the TCP port. At this point, there is no output from the console, and the CDT seems to be waiting for OpenOCD to start. 

So how does CDT determine whether OpenOCD has been successfully started? Where may the problem be?
Thank you in advance for any comments on this issue!

Thanks!
That's exactly the reason. My openOCD is unable to receive echo instructions properly. After fixing this, I can now use CDT for debugging work.

When I used the ""GDB OpenOCD Debugging"" in the diagram for debugging, I found that the suspend button was not working properly. After pressing it for a period of time, an ""Interrupt failed"" error was reported. All other debugging functions are normal, such as breakpoints, step over, and so on. When I use C/C++Remote Debugging, this problem will not exist. Additionally, this issue only occurs in Windows and is not present in Linux.

From the console and development board, it seems that GDB did not receive the interrupt command. What could be the problem? Has anyone else encountered this problem before?

Thank you in advance for all the replies !

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Import a RISC-V C Project.
2. Click the ""Debug Configurations"" and create a new GDB OpenOCD Debugging.
3. Configure openocd and gdb.
4. Start debugging and ""Continue"".
5. Press button ""Suspend"".

When I use the official riscv-none-elf-gdb (xPack), this issue will not occur. So the problem may be that my GDB did not receive an interrupt signal. So could you please tell me how embedded cdt sends an interrupt signal to gdb in Windows? I want to investigate why my gdb cannot receive the signal.

We have one OSGi component [`org.eclipse.embedcdt.internal.packs.ui.MessageConsoles`](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.embedcdt.packs.ui/src/org/eclipse/embedcdt/internal/packs/ui/MessageConsoles.java) to let us reduce UI dependencies. The component definition requires `@Component` annotation that was previously contained in `org.eclipse.osgi.services` bundle for many years. Recently [it was decided](https://github.com/eclipse-equinox/equinox/discussions/402) to replace this annotation with its original definition from OSGi.
Unfortunately, target that we use now `https://download.eclipse.org/releases/2020-09/202009161000` does not contain required `org.osgi.service.component.annotations` package.

We need to either upgrade our target or rework OSGi component to extension point, which is much more verbose but less sensitive to Platform changes.

What is your preference @ilg-ul ?

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Try to build with 2024-06

**Expected behaviour:** Build successful

**Actual behaviour:** `org.eclipse.osgi.services` bundle cannot be found

I am very interested in this issue and have been working to reproduce it.

**Here is my setup:**

* SEGGER J-Link GDB Server V7.96g
* Windows 11
* STM32F407 development board
* J-Link V9 (SWD interface)
* Debug version of Eclipse Embed-CDT built from the source code in this repository

**The steps** to reproduce the issue are as follows:

1. Connect the J-Link to the STM32 development board.
2. Create a new LED template project using Embed-CDT.
3. Set up a new J-Link debugging configuration and start debugging.
4. After hitting a breakpoint, unplug the J-Link (please note that this is not the same as disconnecting the power supply to the development board. Based on my testing, removing the power supply does not reproduce the issue).

**Result**
The IDE suddenly becomes extremely slow and eventually freezes without reporting any errors.
[eclipse_error.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18053393/eclipse_error.log)

The debug log I captured is almost identical to the one shared here. Strangely, even though the freeze in Eclipse is caused by J-Link, there are almost no J-Link-related exceptions in the log. Instead, there are many exceptions related to SWT handles and the UI event loop.


### Solution

Since the issue seems related to the UI events, I noticed that there appears to be an anomaly in J-Link's semi-hosting mode, where there are many unrecognized characters being printed. The issue seems to stem from here! The semi-hosting thread continuously printing data likely consumes a large number of SWT handles. As a result, the UI is not actually frozen; instead, the excessive printing in semi-hosting mode consumes so many resources that Eclipse runs very slowly.

To verify my hypothesis, I modified the input/output stream part of the SemihostingProcess [in the code](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/master/plugins/org.eclipse.embedcdt.debug.gdbjtag.jlink.core/src/org/eclipse/embedcdt/debug/gdbjtag/jlink/core/SemihostingProcess.java#L137C1-L137C38). I added a 1-second delay each time it printed to the console. After making this change, when I repeated the steps above, the IDE no longer froze! (In fact, I also tried disabling the console output, and the result was the same.)

The bug described here:

[#28 Tool conflict in tool chain editor](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/bugs/28/)

and here:

[Conflict while editing tools](https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/support/known-issues/#conflict-while-editing-tools)

is described as benign, but doesn't particularly seem to be benign. For x8664 MinGW C++ targets, I'm able to modify my Used Tools, but for Cross ARM targets, I'm not. Whenever this warning appears, any changes to the selected tools silently fail.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the project properties
2. Click on C/C++ Build
3. Click on Tool Chain Editor
4. Observe that the Current Toolchain is set to Arm Cross GCC
5. Observe that the Current Builder is set to Gnu Make Builder
6. Observe that, in Used Tools, there appear entries for Assembler and Archiver
7. Click on Select Tools...
8. Click on Allow All Changes
9. Remove: GNU Arm Cross Assembler, GNU Arm Cross C Compiler, Gnu Arm Cross C Linker, GNU Arm Cross Archiver, leaving only Cross Arm C++ Compiler, Cross Arm C++ Linker, Cross ARM GNU Create Flash Image, Cross ARM GNU Create Listing, Cross ARM GNU Print Size
10. Click OK
11. Observe that nothing in the Used Tools has changed.

**Expected behaviour:** Be able to remove unwanted tools.

**Actual behaviour:** Silent failure when attempting to remove unwanted tools while the conflict message appears.

That is the most recent build of Windows 10, released in Dec 2024. I haven't seen a report like this before and wonder if there has been a regression on Windows side. I don't have easy access to Windows 10, but I will try to update my Windows 11 test machine to the December build (26100.2605) to see if that exposes the issue.

I would be very surprised if 2024-09 makes any difference as the version of CDT is the same in that version.

Have you been using Embedded CDT for long, or are you a new user. If you have been using Embedded CDT for a while on this Windows Enterprise machine, have you ever seen this starter.exe before? i.e. is this a regression in behaviour, or new to you behaviour?

Yes, the problem can be here if users add a new proj types and it's templates to Eclipse. Under certain circumstances, this new proj type templates can be unviewable in the 'locked' proj type window because the folder is locked. The users must know about the trick with the tick/untick option, otherwise they cannot to create this project.

Is it possible to consider allowing the OpenOCD startup timeout period to be configurable by the user?

I don't think so. That helps when OpenOCD is up and running but, for some reason, slow to respond to GDB Remote Serial Protocol commands and needs more time before timeouts much in.

What this issue is referring to is where Embedded CDT is trying to launch OpenOCD in the first place but, for some reason, it takes ""too long"" to launch, and Embedded CDT times out, gives up and reports an error. 

I have no idea what the timeout used here is, if it's some general timeout in Eclipse/CDT or specific to the Embedded CDT OpenOCD launch support, and if it's configurable via `eclipse.ini` or some other configuration file even if not via the GUI.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/comments/IC_kwDOAnA7286d5o3F/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
