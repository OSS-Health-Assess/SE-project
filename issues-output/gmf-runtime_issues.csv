See [#546820](https://eclip.se/546820) and [the migration guide](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fporting%2Fremovals.html&cp%3D2_3_0).

This includes:

* `org.eclipse.jface.databinding.viewers.ViewersObservables`
* `org.eclipse.jface.databinding.swt.SWTObservables`
* `org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans.BeansObservables`
* `org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans.PojoObservables`
* `org.eclipse.ui.databinding.WorkbenchObservables`

They will be completely removed in 2022-09.

GMF Runtime uses some of these, so must be adapted.

From a quick read of the comments on bug #546820, it seems that the replacements have only been complete starting from around 2020-06 (not sure yet). Depending on how GMF Runtime uses these classes, if we want to be compatible with 2022-09 where these will no longer be available, it might mean we need to drop support for platforms older than ~2020-06 (so that we can use the alternatives).

The vector used to display the edge label is expressed in an orthonormal frame that depends of the orientation of the segment that contains the anchor point. So if the anchor point is at the limit of two segments, when changing the zoom, the segment computation must not vary of one pixel otherwise the edge label is not displayed at the same location.

Depending on the zoom, the bendpoints may slightly differ. While zooming, the precise point may pass from 50,999 to 51,001 and that imply that the PointList will contain 50 or 51.

### Solution

The fix changes how the bendpoints are computed. It leverages precise points to get a round value instead of casting into integer (which takes the nearest lower integer)

The fix is related to Router classes but we could imagine to do the changes inside PointList class in methods setPoint(Point pt, int index) and addPoint(Point p).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-gmf-runtime/gmf-runtime/issues/comments/IC_kwDOGGilMc5gohj2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
