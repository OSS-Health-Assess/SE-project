**Original description:**

This is a feature request to be able to set the start & end timestamps of the window time range OR a start timestamp and window span value. This would be useful when we want to jump to a specific section of the trace, for example when we know through other means (e.g., logs, babeltrace output timestamps) that we want to visualize a specific section. This would also be useful when we want to reliably/consistently set the window time range, e.g., for taking screenshots, etc.

The histogram view allows setting selection start & end timestamps and a window span value [1], but it's not quite the same given that it is the selection range and not the window range. Furthermore, this feature request isn't really about the histogram view specifically. It applies to any view with a typical time axis.

This feature could be implemented as a simple dialog with text boxes for start & end timestamp OR start timestamp and window span that is opened by:

1. A keyboard shortcut
2. Double-clicking on the timestamps shown in the lower left corner
3. Right-clicking on a view's time axis values and clicking on something like ""Set window time range""
4. Or some other mechanism

I could probably contribute this feature, but I just need us to agree on the exact mechanism and whether this feature would be welcome.

**Comment from Bernd Hufmann:**

Hi Christophe

this is a interesting feature suggestion. I agree it would be good to have a way to input a specific time range to navigate to. The histogram view has way to specify the selection range. But, to be honest, it should not have been separate from the Histogram view and it only allows to set the selection range.

The Time Graph views, like the Resources view allow to zoom to a window range that is currently selected by pressing the Z keyboard button. This is good, but it require such a view to be open.

Having an separate window for specifying the window range would be good. Not sure what is the best UX. For sure such a feature needs to be easily discoverable by the user. A dialog or a so called ""Fast View"" of Eclipse could be a way. 

You could decide to allow to specify the selection window and have a button and Keyboard short (e.g. Z) cut to zoom to that selection. 

If you could come up with a proposal implementation would be highly appreciated, because currently we don't have the bandwidth to work on it. Maybe let it try by your users to give feedback and then we can review it and give our feedback.

Thanks a lot for your initiative.

Bernd

**Comment from Ivan Grinenko:**

Hi,

This is a very nice to have feature. As for me I see it implemented as something global (a key combination, or a button on a toolbar of a supported view). By 'global' I mean it should apply the selected time range to all the views having the 'Align Views' option eneabled.

Some features were moved from incubator to Trace Compass mainline (incubator callstack) and the 9.3.0 release doesn't have the migrated code. I can reproduce that behaviour on my laptop and it's also happening on Linux and not just Windows.

You will have to use install the incubator features using the `Add-ons` menu or using update site https://download.eclipse.org/tracecompass.incubator/stable-9.3/repository/. 

Unfortunately, that update site is currently broken. I'm working on a fix for that with PR: https://github.com/eclipse-tracecompass-incubator/org.eclipse.tracecompass.incubator/pull/29. Once it's merged I can re-build the stable-9.3 updates side.

After that I suggest that you install the incubator features from the `Add-on` menu or from that update-site. (BTW, the `Add-on` uses that update site).

From what I can remember, you will have to add a mac signing and a notarization profile in the RCP product pom.xml. Then add flags to the incubator Jenkinsfile to be enable mac signing. In Trace Compass we have a separate jenkins job that does the notarization (https://ci.eclipse.org/tracecompass/job/notarize-tracecompass-dmgs/) which is triggered after a successful build (e.g. nightly.).

No, the trace in the experiment and trace under the traces folder are the same trace. Changes to the settings (trace type) need to be propagated.

version), the user needs to construct a filter using filter
expressions. The filter expressions in general tests values of fields.

The field names are opaque from a user's perspective, and the names
are not created consistently which makes it harder to guess what
fields are available to filter on.

Some fields use lowercase [(""label"", ""entry"")][coremetadata], some use
full upper-case (""CPU"", ""TID""), and some uppercase the first letter
[(""Start Time"", ""End Time"", ""Duration"")][tmfstrings].

The field names are controlled by each time graph dataprovider and are
sometimes dynamically created which does make it harder to enforce
consistency.

Making the fields provided by [default][timegraphstate] consistently
named would be an improvement to set a standard for other fields
(albeit voluntarily). So the basic TimeGraphState could by default
provide fields like:
- ""Label""
- ""Start Time""
- ""End Time""
- ""Duration""

Rather than:
- ""label""
- ""Start Time""
- ""End Time""
- ""Duration""

I think it would be better to ask ""what is useful?"" rather than asking ""what is possible?"".

More specifically, to identify which views would be helpful, my reflex would be to start with identifying whether there are problems real Trace Compass users troubleshoot/analyze that would be facilitated by having some of this additional data. If needed, I could assist in reaching out to folks if you have contacts.

It seems risky to start with the data and directly think about ways to visualize it without grounding them in real use cases. The main risk being that the views are not used in practice and that the development work does not have an impact.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-tracecompass/org.eclipse.tracecompass/issues/comments/IC_kwDOLPg8Us6GgERE/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That's a good point! I don't know who did the instrumentation off the top of my head, but I'll briefly ask around to see if there was a real user-based rationale.

I would argue that without additional user context, any views added risk not actually closing the loop i.e. not being helpful/used.

I did confirm that the instrumentation was created in response to a user request (a while ago). That being said, we don't have knowledge of which fields are used in analyses, what information they extract, and how. There are so many possibilities for what information to visualize and how and I feel the risk is high that we choose wrong.

I think it's worth connecting with users to answer questions like the following:
* How do you use the available log4j information to solve problems? Is it correlated with other data sources? What symptoms do you look for?
* Confirm whether having this information available via a graphical tool would facilitate their work. For example, if they already have a customized automated analysis, a graphical representation may not necessarily integrate into their existing workflow.

I suspect that the parser is choking on the bare error message emitted before the XML response content.

This can probably be solved by adding the --quiet arg to the request, to suppress the bare error output if the parser is not prepared to handle it:

or by redirecting stderr to /dev/null:

To workaround in the short term: Is it possible to disable TraceCompass from querying for JUL domain session list? (via a properties or prefs file, command line arg, etc)  Search didn't turn up any clues...

No, it's not a implicit requirement. I think it's just a matter of ignoring any errors when checking for such UST provider (e.g. JUL, python etc). If it is not supported it should not prevent using other logger providers: [1] is the relevant code line.  Instead of throwing an exception it could just return. Alternatively, we could ignore  some of the errors like done for the default UST provider [2].

We rolled back to previous versions of lttng and re-built the system. No other changes were made. It seems that this is a general incompatibility with lttng v2.13 specifically - it's now returning an error whereas previously in v2.12 it did not.

Turns out our system has never been built with --enable-java-agent-jul nor has it ever had any java runtime installed. The behavior of lttng in this situation is simply different between 2.12 and 2.13.

When exporting a different, shorter `trace.dat` (file version 6) using `trace-cmd report > trace.txt`, I was able to import the `trace.txt` into trace compass.

This leads me to a different problem: The trace markers written in the test application for this issue can be read without issue. However, the trace of the actual program that I want to analyse doesn't get fully loaded in, despite both the binary and ascii file containing every event from start to finish.

The `Statistics` windows of the binary trace file `trace.dat` tells me that there are 1.782.763 events listed. However, the ascii version of the exact same tracing only has 640 events listed. This trace is included in the zip, its name is `long_program.{dat,txt}`. 

I have written a test program that writes 10 times to the trace marker. The source for that is also included in the zip.

One interesting thing I have learned is when filtering a ASCII trace file for printing events, storing the subsequent output and reading it into Trace Compass, I can read the text I have written to the trace marker without any issues.

However, the problem with the limited amount of events Trace Compass can load from an ASCII trace file still is a problem I couldn't resolve.

When parsing a file, I can see that I could only ever see the first 233 events (not related to the uploaded file). By looking at the 234th event with a text editor, I could see that the process's name was `(udev-worker)`. This was the first event that wasn't displayed by Trace Compass, just like all the events that followed. I suspected that the parentheses were a problem for the parser, so I just replaced all occurrences of `(udev-worker)` with `udev-worker`. And now all the aforementioned problems are gone, and all events are listed.

I'm sure the actual fix isn't all too big as everything that needs to be adjusted will most likely just be a RegEx.

I am sorry for the long delay. The issue is in `long_program.dat` right? I tried opening it both in text and binary... Binary works perfectly, it's just the text that's got the issue. I will patch the regex shortly. I want to confirm, is this the problem, at line 640? 


After some programmatic checks, I see that the binary parsing is missing ONE event in 1782764... I will investigate further, I think there are two bugs now.

Parsing the txt file fails at event 640.

Parsing the binary is missing one event.

Yes, the number of events when loading the ASCII version of the `long_program` trace is only 640.

I really like bookmarks and use them frequently, however they tend to get in the way of the trace making it difficult to read, especially if we overlay bookmarks of odd colors. Perhaps it would be better to have it in the background.

The symbols for the LTTng-UST cyg profile analysis can appear only when the UstDebugInfoAnalysis is completed. For large traces, it is necessary to wait quite a while before being able to visualize the stack trace.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Take a large cyg profile trace (>10 million events)
2. Open the trace
3. Symbols do not show

### Additional Information

This is because the UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.getMatchingFile does a full query to get the debug binary information. However, the information has not yet been written into the backend as the interval is closed only at the end of the trace.

I was looking at the performance impact of mxbeans in trace compass logging.


I ran the following code to test, once with mxbeans enabled, once without.

```java
 /**
 * Test Marker
 */
@Test
public void testPerformance() {
    Logger logger = fLogger;

    assertNotNull(logger);
    try (ScopeLog sl = new ScopeLog(logger, Level.WARNING, ""Outer"")) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            new Object();
        }
    }
    fStreamHandler.flush();
    Logger nullLogger = Logger.getAnonymousLogger();
    for (Handler hander : nullLogger.getHandlers()) {
        nullLogger.removeHandler(hander);
    }
    try (ScopeLog sl = new ScopeLog(logger, Level.WARNING, ""Outer"")) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            try (ScopeLog nl = new ScopeLog(nullLogger, Level.FINE, ""inner"")) {
                        new Object();
            }
        }
    }
    try (ScopeLog sl = new ScopeLog(logger, Level.WARNING, ""Outer"")) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            try (ScopeLog nl = new ScopeLog(nullLogger, Level.FINE, ""inner"")) {
                        new Object();
            }
        }
    }
    System.out.println(fLog.getMessages().get(0));
}
```
On an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1145G7 @ 2.60GHz, the following results were obtained.

The test ran, the first pass took ~ 262.1 ns per iteration. The second pass took 526.7 ns/iteration. Removing mxbeans made the second pass take 334.3 ns/cycle. 

| Configuration   | Total Time     | Tracing impact |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| No tracing      | 262.1 ns/event | 0              |
| Tracing         | 334.3 ns/event | 72.1 ns/scope  |
| Tracing+mxbeans | 526.7 ns/event | 264.6 ns/scope |

I would propose making the beans an optional item. The overhead is low but non-null. This choice can be given to the user.

I am trying to parse a CTF trace with Trace Compass. I have saved both the metadata and trace files in a directory and imported it by using the Project Explorer. I did obtain a visualization of my data, but I can't seem to get it to populate the control flow view.

Expected:

Actual:

Although this is probably caused by the timestamps having all the same value, i was still hoping for a depiction of the idle time.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0095321-45ce-4cd8-9386-f0f634858d57)

I am now trying to understand why the ""blocks"" of events are generated together and at a constant interval of .510 seconds. In the meantime, may I ask if Trace Compass has certain requirements for the CTF metadata? Is there a metadata-template to follow or should the tool be able to correctly depict the events regardless of how their fields are named / ordered?

The `Control Flow View` is specific to Linux Kernel traces, e.g. LTTng, FTrace or Perf (converted to CTF). It requires certain trace events and fields to be able to populate it. 

If your trace content can be mapped to those Linux Kernel events and fields, then you could implement a Trace Compass plug-in extension that implements `IKernelTrace`. You will have to provide a so called `IKernelAnalysisEventLayout` to map your trace events to the required format. This is done when post processing the trace file in Trace Compass.

This would need to be done in as a plug-in extension in Java and installed on top of the Trace Compass application. See Trace Compass developer guide for more details on writing a plug-in extension: https://archive.eclipse.org/tracecompass/doc/stable/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/Developer-Guide.html
Note: Browse the source code for `IKernelTrace` and `IKernelAnalysisEventLayout` and how it's used.

Alternatively, you could create such view from scratch a plug-in extension. Trace Compass has a lot of APIs to help with that. See the developer guide above for this as well. 

If don't want to write Java code, you could use the data-driven analysis and view capabilities of Trace Compass. You can define the state machine in XML and define the view mapping in XML as well. This will populate such view. Here is some documentation:
https://archive.eclipse.org/tracecompass/doc/stable/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/Data-driven-analysis.html#Data_driven_analysis

Lastly, you could use EASE scripting to create such view. Here is a tutorial on how to do that:
