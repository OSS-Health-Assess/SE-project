I think, in regular p2-repositories the manifest-variables (not other variables in ""plugin.xml"" or so) are resolved also without the entry inside the manifest.
One not working example is the bundle **com.google.guava** at version **10.0.1.v201203051515**.
If I add manually a file ""plugin.properties"" to the root of the jar and also the entry into the manifest, the resolution works.

As you can see packagedrone merged the netty-Feature into my shell-Feature. Am I doing something wrong or is it a bug?

I noticed every generated Feature looks the same. Also the first generated Feature netty looks like the others. It seems to be only one generated Feature is deployed for every one.

For the person who is going to implementing this I'll will describe our usecases. 
1. We are creating Api-Bundles for defining the communication-interface. For every product (which has one or more api) we are creating one feature which cotains all necessary Api-Bundles for that product. We would like to have one channel, we call it 'common-model', where you can find any feature for a product, so you know how to communicate with the api.
2. Every product is structured in the same way and need nearly the same third-party dependencies. So we started to create a shell-feature which contain every dependency for using the console in eclipse and we created a feature which contains all depencies for providing a REST-api and so on .... It would be nice if we could provide all these features in the same channel for example 'thirdparty features'

**As Workaround we are creating a channel for every feature we want to have.**

_This is our usecase :D of course there a lot of different other examples. But I hope this will help to get an image how it could/should work._

So there are no maven metadatas available for the binary. 

In the artifacts.xml the binary occurs as expected and the rule of the URL seems correct:

```xml
<mappings size=""3"">
  <rule filter=""(&(classifier=osgi.bundle))"" output=""${repoUrl}/plugins/${id}/${version}/${id}_${version}.jar""/>
  <rule filter=""(&(classifier=binary))"" output=""${repoUrl}/binary/${id}/${version}/${id}_${version}""/>
  <rule filter=""(&(classifier=org.eclipse.update.feature))"" output=""${repoUrl}/features/${id}/${version}/${id}_${version}.jar""/></mappings>
...
<artifact classifier=""binary"" id=""org.eclipse.rcp_root"" version=""4.4.2.v20150204-1700"">
 <properties size=""1"">
   <property name=""download.size"" value=""36407""/>
  </properties>
</artifact>
```

But when we request the binary with its URL, an artifacts.xml is returned instead of the binary:
`myDroneServer:8080/p2/myChannel/binary/org.eclipse.rcp_root/4.4.2.v20150204-1700/org.eclipse.rcp_root_4.4.2.v20150204-1700` -> returns an artifacts.xml

if you give us a hint - we could help to fix the issue.

Package Drone can re-use the Tycho P2 index data which is uploaded during the Maven 2 deploy process. Or it can create its own P2 index data.

In the latter case, this would be an issue with Package Drone. In the first case it would look like an issue with Tycho.

Package Drone try to start before I got my network devices to run. That causes my system to hang during system start. (After changing the init.d-script I got my system back to work.)
So i tried a bit around.
- Removing the /etc/rc2.d/S17packag... did nothing because server starts in runlevel 2 ^^ But my Server starts (without Package Drone)
- Moving /etc/rc2.d/S17packagedrone to S18 did nothing too.

All things back to normal.

Workaround: Moving /etc/rc2.d/S17package ... to /etc/rc2.d/K17packagedrone so its going to be ignored during startup

You can have a look at all the files provided by the Package Drone DEB using:

dpkg -L org.eclipse.packagedrone.server

Meaning that your SysV startup process is switched to the Package Drone server.

Removing the ""exec"" and adding a ""&"" at the end of the line will, at least, fork off the server process.

Eventually its going to be generated automatically during the ""installation"" ? So it need du be influenced, so that the process is going to be forked ?

So maybe there is some process on debian which converts upstart scripts into SysV script. I don't know much about debian, I have to admit.

Do you have a working SSH setup for GitHub already? Including a GitHub account?

If not, please ensure that you do have an account at GitHub, added your local SSH key to your GitHub account and checked out just any project from GitHub at least once using Eclipse and the eGit plugin (the default Eclipse Git Plugin).

And please be sure to select the ""Eclipe.org"" version in the Eclipse installer. It seems you selected the ""GitHub"" version. The Package Drone installer recipe in the GitHub branch is the old version and will be removed shortly.

I did try to cover this in the wiki as well [1]

I hope this helps.

Jens

3. If the user press DELETE, a confirmation dialog would show up listing the selected keys to be deleted.
4. If confirmed, it would be just a matter of looping over an array of ids to delete, calling the `/pgp.sign.managed/ID_TO_DELETE/delete""` URL with some JS

As you can see, not all entries can be deleted. Some are ""virtual"" and only their parents can be deleted. This is not true for all children, but there is a method to find that out.

Also deleting them one by one from the UI using JavaScript is ok for the PGP keys, but for the artifacts this could cause serious performance issues. After modifying operations, channels may get ""aggregated"", meaning repository indexes being rebuilt. Doing this one by one would cause a lot of aggregation runs. Therefore the server should receive a full set IDs to delete. It can to this in one operation and so there should only be one aggregation run necessary.

These alter the state of a channel but work more like a passive element during the whole process.

Sometimes it is necessary to execute actions triggered be certain conditions. These actions are executed at a specific time and do not necessarily alter the state of a channel.

A trigger is more like ""if this, then that"". While an aspect Always transforms the channel in the same way, there is no operation involved. 

There are two classic examples in Package Drone which failed this idea. The ""Tycho Cleaner"" and the ""Cleanup"" aspect. Those were implemented as an aspect (due to the missing trigger system back then) but did not produce the same channel state when removing and re-adding those aspects.

Also can aspects only be added once to a channel, leading to the trouble of only having a single cleanup configuration (see also issue ctron/package-drone#94).

There should be a trigger system which allows:
- To be fired by various conditions (internal and external)
- To hook up actions for each trigger
- To support different trigger context (pre add, post add)
- To configuration additional trigger instances (like timer, URL action)
- To have factories for Triggers and Actions

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/packagedrone/issues/31,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/packagedrone/issues/31,packagedrone,131672936,31,Design internal filter API,ctron,202474,Jens Reimann,ctron@dentrassi.de,OPEN,2016-02-05T15:34:26Z,2016-02-05T15:34:26Z,"Package Drone needs an internal filter API. Internal at least for now. The core use cases for this filter API is to filter for artifacts based on a single channel or a set of artifacts.

There are many use cases. First of old the long standing request for filling features based on a sub-set of the channel (see ctron/package-drone#66), a global search function (see ctron/package-drone#114) could also benefit from such an API and the cleanup aspect could also benefit from having a filter.

Now the requirements to such a filter API are:
- Provide a type safe model of the filter
- Have the possibility to serialized and deserialize the filter to a string (query string)
- Be easy to write in Java source as well as query string

So I would like to see something in the source code that looks like this:

``` java
MetaKey MY_KEY = new MetaKey ( ""ns"", ""key"" );
ArtifactLocator al = …;

al.search ( Filters.equals ( MY_KEY, ""foo-bar"" ) );
al.search ( Filters.or ( Filters.equals ( MY_KEY, ""foo-bar"" ), Filters.equals ( MY_KEY, ""bar-foo"") );

// using import static

al.search ( equals ( MY_KEY, ""foo-bar"" ) );
al.search ( or ( equals ( MY_KEY, ""foo-bar"" ), equals ( MY_KEY, ""bar-foo"") );

// with a query string

al.search ( Filters.parse ( ""foo:bar = foo-bar or foo:bar = bar-foo"" ) );
al.search ( Filters.parse ( ""foo:bar = 'foo-bar' or foo:bar = 'bar-foo'"" ) );
```

With a search method like:

``` java
List<ArtifactInformation> result = al.search ( predicate);
List<ArtifactInformation> result = al.search ( predicate, options );
```

Of course it would be possible to use Java 8 stream on the interface, and I guess it might be a good idea to use them for implementing the ArtifactLocator for some channel types. But considering the possibility that there might be a database or some sort of index being involved some time in the future, I would like to use a filter model which is a real model which can then be transformed in e.g. a stream setup, but also to some sort of JPA query.

I does have a visual style which is OK in general. But the API to this control is a rather quick JavaScript hack.

It would nice to have a more decent API for this tag list input control which helps in initially rendering, updating, validating and re-ordering the tag list. The API should be inspired by Bootstrap's JavaScript components API.

Seems like the `findLaucher` is supposed to return the Equinox Launcher path but it doesn't find any jar on the indicated file.

Looks like I'm missing some step before running the package drone suite.
Is there any prior step before running drone tests? I don't think this specific issue is related to OS because indeed I didn't find any /target/instance/plugins path.

Any suggestions?

However Pax Web has a few serious issues with re-registering Servlets, has a few bugs internally, does not implement the OSGi R6 HttpService patterns.

In addition to that it is pretty hard to get in contact with the project updates and bug fixes seem rare.

The most nasty bug Package Drone currently struggles with is the inability to re-register a servlet under the same name. This will require a restart of Package Drone whenever an HTTP endpoint trigger is being re-configured.

1. Switch back to Equinox Http Service
2. Switch to Apache Felix HTTP Service

Both solutions claim to provide OSGi R6 compatible HttpService and Http Whiteboard implementations. This should suffice for Package Drone at the present state and would allow for a plain OSGi approach.

The issue with the Equinox Http Service seems to be solved: [467859](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=467859)

Do you mean it is hard to get in contact with a Pax Web maintainer? Can't confirm that statement.

IIRC that is already solved.

This seems to be Pax Web 6.0, which is not ready for prime time though ... 

[1] talks about Jetty 8 and Pax web 4.x, [2] about Jetty 6.x

I mean, I do know it is working with Jetty 9.2.x ... 

Anyway, I am not sure Equinox OSGi R6 support is in a better condition. There was a good reason for switching _towards_ Pax Web!

But keeping track of Pax Web is quite a time consuming task.

Still, you are right! I will give Pax Web 4.1.5 another try, we are currently at 4.1.2!

I still do think that moving back to Equinox will reduce the number of CQs and external dependencies required by Package Drone. So the Package Drone would benefit from that by requiring less work in integrating external dependencies.

On the other hand, Pax Web does work now, after the upgrade to 4.2.5. So replacing the web runtime again is not free of work either.

I was playing with Package Drone when by accident I selected the same Jar file twice.
I noticed that the system didn't handle my bad submission.

I continued to test this functionality and I also noticed that even if I not select any file and press upload, the system doesn't show any warning message. See the attached images for more details:

In general there is no limitation on duplicates. However some aspects may veto that by throwing an exception in their code and rolling back the modification by that.

The next version will bring ""triggers"", which can hooked in various phases of repository modifications. And there will be one trigger which allows to ignore or fail an addition based on a set of conditions, e.g. enforcing a unique debian/OSGi version or so.

I am about to use the current version 0.12.0 of Package Drone in our OSGi-based Enterprise Application. In that application, we are using a product definition to describe the final shippment of the application. With that product definition and Maven/Tycho we then export the complete application, including dependencies (e.g. Eclipse Equinox, ...) into a ZIP file. We also create native launcher artifacts within that export so that after extracting the ZIP file the application can directly be launched via an *.exe file on windows and a bin file on linux systems.

However, when consuming the Eclipse Platform SDK version 4.5.2 (Eclipse Mars) from a Package Drone server version 0.12.0, the product export does not unpack the platform-specific launcher fragments (like ""org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.300.v20150602-1417"" for windows 64 bit) anymore. It does not make a difference whether to run the product export from the IDE via the product definition wizzard or via Maven/Tycho. The mentioned launcher fragment is exported as JAR which impeeds the launching of the product since it cannot load the contained dll file. That launcher fragment always needs to be unpacked into a folder named the same way as also specified by the missing ""unpack='false'"" directive in the ""org.eclipse.equinox.executable"" feature from where the launcher artifact is taken.

When doing exactly the same thing with exporting the products via the IDE for example and consuming all dependencies from an HTTPd server hosting the download of [1], the product export unpacks the mentioned launcher fragment and everything works with launching the application.

Do you guys have any idea of what can be the reason for this behavior?

I created a simple demo project and attached it to this post. It should be self-explanatory, but of course, you will have to provide both, a Package Drone 0.12.0 installation and a local p2 repository hosted on an HTTP server, both hosting the download of [1].

I would really appreciate any hint even if it only leads to further questions and ideas of how to proceed in solving this issue.

this morning, I myself had an idea what might be wrong leading to the problem described above: The p2 metadata generated by Package Drone might be different from the one downloaded with the Eclipse Platform SDK from [1]. I compared the metadata information in content.xml and artifacts.xml provided with the stated download with the one provided by Package Drone after uploading the Eclipse Platform SDK to the channel and - voila - they are different:

There is a section about the ""org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.300.v20150602-1417"" fragment in the content.xml and they have reasonable differences. I somehow assume the unpacking thing is about the following part:

`<instructions size='2'>
      <instruction key='zipped'>
        true
      </instruction>
    </instructions>`

I attached and extract of the two content.xml files to this post.

Maybe the problem can simply be solved by uploading the original metadata content.xml and artifacts.xml from the download to the Package Drone channel. Does anyone of you know if this is possible and how?

Best regards

Hello everybody,

in the meantime, I maybe found a way to ""work around"" the problem: Uploading the entire download of the Eclipse Platform SDK as a ZIP file (e.g. p2repo.zip) to a plain channel with only aspects ""Hasher"" and ""Mime"" and then consuming it via http://<host>/unzip/newestByName/<channel>/p2repo.zip as described in the Package Drone Cheatsheet at least works from within the IDE, i.e. resolving via a target definition and exporting the product via the PDE build. I did not test yet whether it works with Maven/Tycho, too, but I will do this probably this afternoon.

However, I also thing that re-using already provided p2 meta data from a download is really a use case since there's a growing number of p2-ready repositories provided for projects out there.

I'm curious about the progress on this issue.

Timo

Sonatype Nexus provides the capability to group different repositories into a so-called group repository. So for maintenance, the content is still nicely separated into different repositories, but for consumption via Maven, only one URL to the group repository needs to be specified. This is especially useful when using authorization for reading from repositories since only one ""<server>"" entry is then needed in the Maven settings.xml instead of one for each repository.

Something like that would be nice for at least p2 repositories in Package Drone. One could then host different frameworks like Eclipse Platform SDK, Eclipse Birt SDK, Eclipse DTP SDK, Google Guava, etc. in individual channels for easier maintenance, but still consume everything or any kind of subset via additionally configured group channels while specifying credentials in the settings.xml only once.

In p2 there is already a concept for that, called ""composite repositories"". Maybe this can be integrated somehow into Package Drone?

It's fine to integrate, if I understand it you had implement a realm similar JAAS that cycles all security declarative services (ds) and if one return null try with next one. 
The difficult is on the UserStore. While the SecurityServiceImpl supports multiple UserService, the web ui and some other classes support only one UserStore (cardinality 1..1) and some web page cast directly to DatabaseUserInformation.
So if I implement the LDAP UserService with own UserStore it's uncert which UserStore service will be used and the UserStorageModelProvider it's not exported by own plugin.

Many years ago I use an eclipse plugin originally developed by IBM Lotus Notes guys that implement an [OSGi realm based on JAAS](https://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Equinox_Security_Integration) that use LoginModule and User/Role Principal, but it uses eclipse extension point.

I'm also considering to use third party implementation for LDAP connection that support various LDAP, but some of those (for example apache directory) has a lot of dependencies :-1:

The `UserStorage` is only allowed once and pretty much related to a database backend.

However, it should not be necessary to actually use it, since the `UserStorage` is currently only used to create users, which you wouldn't want to do using LDAP. There is the `GodModeService`, which does implement the ""admin token"" logon, using a different `UserService` implementation.

I do know this implementation JAAS based implementation. And the current implementation is a simple mixture of that and Spring Security. The problem with all those is, that they bring in too many dependencies and especially Spring is a beast when it comes to OSGi.

I would say the an LDAP security module should not be able to actually create LDAP users. So maybe you need to store some preferences at some point, but then we would some sort of `PreferenceService` which works independently of the actual `UserService` implementation.

User data syncronization could happens in some manner: never, every login or scheduled.

After user logged in, the administrator could setup its roles, not possible for in-memory user as in godmode. In many system users could also setup some own attributes as mail (or other) different from LDAP. The password attribute and some key attributes (as user id) are not permitted to be changed.
This is the reason usually LDAP users are persisted.

Depending on the plugin of LDAP integration (and from LDAP) it could discover also groups, typically by memberOf LDAP attribute but not all LDAP server fully support it (for example OpenLDAP). It's not best practice using LDAP groups to match its role on the group name because the role/group ADMIN or MANAGER could give special grant in other software (that matches that role name) you do not want to. Typically LDAP group is used in LDAP filter to subset users that could access this software.

We would configure apache to serve package drone on http://myserver/pdrone -> http://localhost:8080/ (pdrone to internal root context path). Other software are in that server and mapped on different context path.
The reverse proxy show only the main page, all reference the HTML page are absolute

> src=""/resources...""

so all resources are not loaded because browser lookup them on _http://myserver/pdrone_ instead _http://myserver/pdrone/resource_.
Looking the code there are some URL build with **${pageContext.request.contextPath} + ""/relativePath""** (I do understand how to change contextPath using config file) other as **src=""/channel""** so they never work on different context path than root.

Relative URL should work fine.
We would avoid use a different hostname (virtualhost), please consider that this restriction it's an IT pain for the way on how they would deploy the software.

Is possible have an option to ignore duplicate artifacts (based on MD5)?
So in web channel page we could receive a warning message that resource was skipped instead with REST API have get an HTTP 200 for the first artifact and 204 for the subsequent.

And now my message:
We are using authentication HTTp basic but we want to keep the user deploy only for the jenkins and then developers will have access to a codegen-staging channel with another user password. I know we can use another password but since our proxy also requires it the only way to pass is have the same user and password in the proxy and in packagedrone.
Then we dont need to expose the password to the developers because it will be only in the jenkin maven setting.

Many thanks,
Miguel

E.g. The bundle test.exporter provides a limeds.link resource with the id test.exporter.FunctionA by adding the following manifest entry: 
`Provide-Capability: limeds.link;limeds.component.id:String=""test.exporter.FunctionA"";limeds.component.version:String=""000001000""`

Another bundle then requires this resource, by adding the following manifest entry:
`Require-Capability: limeds.link;filter:=""(&(limeds.component.id=test.exporter.FunctionA)(&(limeds.component.version>=000001000)(!(limeds.component.version>=001000000))))"";effective:=resolve`

Using bnd, I can create a repository that supports this custom capability (see attached [bnd-index.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/packagedrone/files/312054/bnd-index.txt) file), but package drone seems to ignore these capabilities and requirements statements (see attached [packagedrone-index.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/packagedrone/files/312056/packagedrone-index.txt)).

The only way of creating a “real” user is to use the web interface using the ‘admin’ and generated hash.

Is it possible to setup an environment export channel and import that while building the docker image via a command line?

Is it possible to provision a “default” user with password. 

I’ve solved the user part jut {storage path}/users.json – but password seems to be put elsewhere.

Cheers,

the ""admin"" user token (and user name) can be overridden using a system property. I will look that up.

The password is stored in the ""users.json"" file as well, just as a hashed and salted password, not in plaintext. The field is called ""passwordHash"" and ""passwordSalt"".

I am not sure I fully understood the first question regarding the export channel? Maybe you can tell me what you are trying to do.

In general what you can do is to setup up an instance of Package Drone and then copy over the plain file in the filesystem. It may be that this structure changes over releases, but in one release your would be safe. It is also possible to assign a ""deploy"" key to a channel and import a full channel (or multiple channels at once) using a HTTP request and a ZIP file.

Also will there be a REST based API in the next version. But I am not sure if all features you need will be present.

I now do copy the data path - I've set it to /var/packagedrone where I do a 'docker cp <container>:/var/packagedrone - > packagedrone.tar' and added that to the Dockerfile 'ADD' command.

I believe it would be ideal to support the ability to:

- Configure a channel to allow (snapshot) packages to be purged if they are older then `X` days.
- Configure a channel to allow (snapshot) packages to be purged if a given channel has more than `Y` packages in said channel (removing older packages first).

This would could also rely on the capability of PackageDrone to support its own scheduler (ie. cron; if a schedule system is not already internally implemented/supported).

I assume there are no active plans for anyone to provide the capabilities. If any individuals or contributors have an opportunity to make suggested related to or decide to take the time to implement this feature, I'm hoping this issue will be a proper place to track (edit: although, the mailing list would also be an appropriate place to make these comments/suggestions to as well)

This prevents us from using the tycho generated p2 metadata, because each deployment would overwrite previous metadata and hide other deployments. Thus we use the tycho cleaner aspect and the P2 Metadata Generator which almost works. There is one big hickup: In contrast to the tycho generated metadata, the generated metadata does not use the ""Eclipse-BundleShape"" tag. The effect is that all bundles comming from a PackageDrone repository are zipped in product build results which is an error for some bundles. (e.g. JUnit & bundles with native code). We can fix this error by using the tycho metadata, but this way we need a large number of repositories and can not collect bundles to a single repo.

Possible Solution would be that PD would generate the same metadata for bundles that need to be unpacked that tycho generates:

The difference in the content.xml for bundles with ""Eclipse-BundleShape: dir"" is one more instruction in the touchpoinData:
<touchpointData size='1'> <instructions size='2'> <instruction key='zipped'> true </instruction> <instruction key='manifest'> Bundle-SymbolicName: ... </instruction> </instructions> </touchpointData>
instead of the current generated content.xml:
<touchpointData size='1'> <instructions size='1' <instruction key='manifest'> Bundle-SymbolicName: ... </instruction> </instructions> </touchpointData>
Of course, the additional touchpoint instruction must be present only when the ""Eclipse-BundleShape"" is set to ""dir"".","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/packagedrone/issues/109/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The changes would also be updating more than just the flags tho ( since access to FileFlags is encapsulated ).

Currently however - how does one simply build the project? Running `mvn clean install` using the `pom.xml` in the repository fails to build with missing P2 repositories:

```
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.core.ProvisionException: No repository found at file:////Users/amrk/temp/packagedrone/bundles
``

Is there a way of bootstrapping P2 repositories/build? I see it's declared in the pom as `file:///${basedir}/../../runtime/target/repository`...

# Description
I found a strange behaviour of the resulting p2 repository of a channel, where artifacts got uploaded via gradle (maven-publish).

I was able to sucessfully upload my OSGi-Bundles and the p2 metadata (OSGi metadata and Manifest headers) is generated/extracted correctly, as I can see in the channel's content. 

When it comes to add the p2 repository to a target definition file in my Eclipse, no Bundles (or Features) are shown.

Creating a Feature (in Packagedrone directly or as uploaded artifact), that includes the OSGi Bundles, did not help either.

Strangely the provided repo.zip file contains the Bundles correctly.

Am I missing something or is this an actual bug?

I think we were able to track down, why it did not work in the first place. We were working on a utilities project, so we named the channel ""Utilities"". Apparently this is an somehow invalid name for a repository. After renaming, the repository was working correctly.

Also we saw, that a feature is needed to reference the p2 repository in a target definition file.
This can be worked around of course and basically is a good practice to have one.

So the bug now seems to be the invalid name ""Utilities"".
Using the Channel's ID works fine.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/packagedrone/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjM4NDI1OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I do agree with the change in general and I would definitely like to bring this in.

There are two things which I would like you to consider in the change:
1. Please add yourself to the copyright header and be sure to have signed the [ECA](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php). Let me know if you need any help with this.
1. Currently people using this functionality might expect to name to be generated like this. So I think it would be best to make this configurable. Like setting a ""default name provider"" which can be set in order to override the current behavior. Or replaced altogether with a custom implementation.
   The default  for now should be the current naming. With the option to override this. In the major next version we should switch this. So that you have the new behavior as default and switch to the legacy one manually.

What do you think?!

1. Create a channel with a `Maven Repository` aspect.

3.

I'm uploading the following artifacts (in this order):

myBundle-1.0.0.20181214-1200.jar
myBundle-1.0.0.20181214-1200-tests.jar
myBundle-1.0.0.20181214-1200-sources.jar

The tests and sources are uploaded as children of the main jar, so that it gets displayed as (as intended):

```
+ myBundle-1.0.0.20181214-1200.jar
|- myBundle-1.0.0.20181214-1200-tests.jar
|- myBundle-1.0.0.20181214-1200-sources.jar
```

The Maven Repository aspect does something weird now: In the repo, there are directories for (again, everything correct here):

```
1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/
1.0.0.20181214-1200/
1.0.0.20181214-1200-sources/
1.0.0.20181214-1200-tests/
```

However, the 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT directory **points to the sources**. (**Problem 1**) I would expect it to point to the built jar with .class files.

I guess the last uploaded item is used as SNAPSHOT (in this case the source).

The **second problem**: The maven-metadata.xml file lists all versions, *including the sources and tests* (this is ... okay I guess), but the fields for `release` and `latest` **point to the tests**.

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?><metadata>

I don't know why the tests are used as `release` and `latest`, maybe it is sorted alphabetically?

While the RPM lead allows for (encoded) names only up to 66 bytes, it is possible to store longer names in RPMs using tags.
See: http://ftp.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-file-format-rpm-file-format.html 

After some cursory investigation, here some ideas on how to address this:
**a) Handled within this library:**
Investigating how the lead is being created, `LeadBuilder.build()` creates a `Lead` instance based on `RpmLead.toLeadName()`. Either the builder, or possibly the `toLeadName()` function, should truncate the string. Though, since this is before charset encoding (happening in `RpmWriter.writeLead()`), this might not be the best place. Perhaps simply truncate the (encoded) name in `RpmWriter.writeLead()` instead of throwing an exception; And somewhere the `RpmTag.NAME` is filled. (I know too little of the responsibilities of builder, writer, ... at this point.)

**b) Handled within user-library:**
Should [ctron/rpm-builder](https://github.com/ctron/rpm-builder) pass in a truncated name and provide a header customizer in `RpmBuilder` that sets the RpmTag.NAME element?

I'd vote for a solution within this library, as b) would require the knowledge of the internal limitations of the data structures, as well as causing duplication in all using code...

I think the first thing to do is to limit the number of bytes written in the method `org.eclipse.packagedrone.utils.rpm.build.RpmWriter.writeLead()`.

I have tried adding triggers, but it's not working as expected.

I am using Package Drone with Jenkins. 

**Scenario:**
Jenkins picks up a change on commit, job starts, pipeline script deploys the plugins to package drone.

I would like to clear the channel before deploying plugins?

Thanks.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-archived/packagedrone/issues/143/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
