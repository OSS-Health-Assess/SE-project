Sure, if Mylyn wants to maintain and improve it, that's perfectly fine
with me. We never did much with it. I think the only new development in
the past couple of years in the Mylyn connector was my changing the
repository set-up dialog to support GitHub PATs better.

However, see below:
* Keep org.eclipse.egit.github.core where it currently is; don't move

This PR also copies org.eclipse.egit.github.core, which is **not** part
of the Mylyn connector. It is a completely separate thing and does not
depend on Mylyn or EGit at all.

I would prefer that one to stay where it is, in the
org.eclipse.egit.github repository. Reasons:

1. It is independent.
2. It uses a BREE of JAVA 8 for Android compatibility.
3. It should be versioned, built, tested, and published independently.

In particular it should be published to maven central.

Some technical things:

The connector makes use of EGit internal classes. EGit has removed it
from x-friends in MANIFEST.MF. Expect a lot of PDE warnings about
discouraged accesses.

I would expect that these accesses to internal classes would be analyzed
and be removed eventually. We'd have to figure out what stable APIs EGit
core and UI would have to provide instead.

EGit does not guarantee anything about internal classes.

Bundle org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui, which was removed in the EGit
repository in commit 12a21a6c, should probably also be moved to Mylyn.

There, too, we have internal accesses.

Cheers,

I'm not sure. The notification engine of Mylyn contains code to suppress notifications which is not available in JFace AFAIK. However, notifications are probably not a core part of Mylyn.

Let me try to explain my request a bit better.

It looks like you have built a connector for GL. We think a GL connector is important.

Indeed, my request was not for money (thanks Maarten), but for your code. I should have called it code contribution and not donation. Sorry for the confusion.

If you want, you can become an Eclipse Mylyn committer and help maintain the connector.

We did not look at your code yet, so I am not sure if it is even possible.

Some of the things that should happen are:

* You have to license the code under EPL
* Your code has to move to the org.eclipse namespace.
* You have to sign the eclipse contributor agreement and declare that all the copyright of the code belongs to you and that you contribute the code to the open source.

There are probably a couple of other things that I have forgotten but these are the basics.

(see https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/142)

Mylyn integrates with a number of libraries from Apache and other providers many of which use the Apache commons logging framework. To avoid potentially confusing output to appear on the console Mylyn sets the ""org.apache.commons.logging.Log"" system property to ""org.apache.commons.logging.impl.NoOpLog"" which suppresses any output (users can override this behavior by explicitly setting the system property in which case it is not modified).
Unfortunately, the logging configuration affects all consumers of commons logging. This can be problematic if other consumers that are not aware of Mylyn's default configuration intend to configure logging in a different way (e.g. [bug 353168](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=353168)).
Since logging is a platform concern it doesn't seem right to have explicit logging configuration in Mylyn. What is the best way to configuring logging? Should there be support in platform? Should each logging system be configured by separate bundles that are included on a distribution package level? Any other suggestions?

When possible, Eclipse defaults would be the way to go.

https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse4CSS/article.html contains many clues, but you probably already found it.

Theming is based on CSS, and when the plugin spy is installed, you can use CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F6 to see how the component is styled.

I am facing an issue while using mylyn notifications feed plugin with Java11. The issue is occurring due to required bundle javax.xml.bind in org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.notifications.feed in version 3.25.2 and 3.26 as well. My project has required dependency on jakarta.xml.bind. So now both these dependencies are causing issue during resolution of javax.xml.bind package.

This is already handled in main branch https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/blob/main/mylyn.commons/org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.notifications.feed/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF where javax.xml.bind is not a required dependency.

So, just want to know when the next version from main will be released. Contributing guidelines seems out of date, so not sure how I can I raise a PR for new branch as well.

Can someone please help me on this?

Regards,
Ajay.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/49/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Hi @gnl42, Our project is RCP project where the dependencies are resolved via target definition. There is no entry for javax.xml.bind in the target definition but it is getting downloaded via org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.notifications.feed. So I cannot manually change the plugins in the build. And com.sun.xml.bind_2.2.0.v20201118-1845.jar is already there in the plugins folder.
I think issue here is required dependency of javax.xml.bind in org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.notifications.feed","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIdEFis5UXhSD/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sam Davis:
`hanks for the detailed bug report! It looks like the problem is that your server is not returning a 404 for /j_acegi_security_check - could you confirm what response you get when doing a GET to that URL? It's only when getting a 404 there that the connector tries /j_spring_security_check. Since we no longer support versions prior to 3.0.1 we should probably try the latter first and fall back to the former if it fails: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/21655/. This appears to still work for Hudson 2.2.1.`

Sam Davis:
`Thanks. It sounds like providing the auth header might be a better solution, but it will be a while before we have time to look into that. It could help to speed this up if you submitted a code review. :)`

The GitHub connector accomplishes this by kludging around the repository setup page code by detecting/intercepting the flow of the setup process.

It would be nice to have this option added to the base code so any connector can access the option, and make it less likely that any future code changes break the github connector

The exclude is only for the ""Projects Import"" so .project files in that part of the repository are ignored.

  If you import  you get 65 errors in the Error View

Why are these ""projects"" around if it requires special knowledge to

What's the purpose of the projects?

- Eclipse is moving from git / Gerrit to GitHub / Gitlab
- the actual active Gerrit version is 3.5 or greater (see [Gerrit Supported Versions](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/support.html))

It's hard to tell which ones in the list are generated versus which ones are actually already well-formed OSGi artifacts:

https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/blob/f8a6aa79cac4838c788101fd10f470971ba6bdce/org.eclipse.mylyn-target/mylyn-e4.26.target#L69-L141

I really don't see how we can properly coordinate versions of libraries  in SimRel when projects independently of each other  generate wrappers for non OSGi-libraries.  What's generated depends on the BND recipe:

https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/blob/f8a6aa79cac4838c788101fd10f470971ba6bdce/org.eclipse.mylyn-target/mylyn-e4.26.target#L132-L141

Each project may and likely will use a different recipe which appears likely to result in many different artifacts that use the same key such that they appear to be the same artifact from a p2 perspective but are actually different.   That's not just a problem for SimRel but a problem in general when installing such content into any installation.

Here's an example:

https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/blob/ac34c5f440f95e1046ecb69b1c3c5c8514cb4a86/target-platform/tm4e-target.target#L44-L52

Making all the package imports optional in the recipe is convenient but is highly likely to be wrong:
```
Import-Package:        *;resolution:=optional
```

In any case, these artifacts are not even being PGP signed as far as I can tell:

https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/archive/reports-extra/mylyn/download.eclipse.org/mylyn/stage/latest/index.html

It's also strange to see EGit's GitHub integration come from a Maven repository rather than more directly from EGit's downloads:

https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/blob/f8a6aa79cac4838c788101fd10f470971ba6bdce/org.eclipse.mylyn-target/mylyn-e4.26.target#L126-L130

I don't think that's a good suggestion, as orbit is always lacking behind and there is no compelling reason for a project to depend on orbit releases if the artifact is on maven, there might be some exceptions where it does not work, but in general the goal should be to get the OSGi metadata into the original library beside the following recommendations:

1. **Never (!)** use require bundle for a third party dependency, but an import package with appropriate version range (either consumer or provider)
2. Do not include third party dependencies in any `feature.xml` as dependencies will be pulled in anyways if used
3. if wrapping is required, choose a custom prefix, e.g.  `Bundle-SymbolicName:   mylyn.${mvnGroupId}.${mvnArtifactId}` and review the resulting manifest if you publish them.

That way OSGi (and P2) can always substitute / reuse an alternative version of the artifact, in the worst-case there will be different wrapped ones with same content but that's nothing unusual/forbidden/dangerous, that's what OSGi was designed for!

I tried to avoid drawing attention to what TM4E is doing because that looks like anarchy to me and is not what the Platform is doing.   But now we're sliding down that slippery slope and will need to deal with that too.   So we need the rule:

 **No generated Maven dependencies allowed.**

What @laeubi suggests will mean every project creates its own key/version of generated IUs, so no collisions.  But **lots** of duplicates, but at least they won't look like duplicates.   If projects avoid bundle requirements then  which variant ends up on the train seems indeterminate.  It will be hard for projects to get those bundles into their repositories though, unless they include all requirements, in which case they will fill up their repo with the entire Eclipse platform and any other project on which they depended; maybe there is a solution for that too.  If the generated package exports aren't versioned, one cannot control which version of you end up with, so that seems like a new form or anarchy.

we absolutely don't, see above for a simple list of recommendations. This won't result in duplicates if all projects use the same version and semantic imports. And even if there are some duplicates this does not harm anything.

If I say we absolutely do need such a rule and you say we absolute don't, then that is the end of the discussion isn't it?  Then there is no point is reasoning further because the lines are etched in the concrete.  Then we will have to go to the supreme court of justice and get a ruling.  It unfortunately feels futile to even have a discussion because only certain facts seem to matter.  We saw the problem with gson duplicates last release cycle, yet you assert duplicates do not harm anything.  At best they do no harm, other than bloat, but at worst they cause very hard to fix problems that we can of course blame on bad metadata, bad semantic versioning and other bad things that bad people do, but things that one one can actually solve as well.

Yes, the idea is to produce update sites that can be quickly (in a matter of minutes) be produced and that are automatically updated to the latest version by a generator that looks at maven central.

I presented some technical facts, but you argument with ""another form of anarchy"" (while this is actually a form of _autonomy_) so yes it seems that some specific _feelings_ seem to matter much more than facts.

> But if centralized-except-for-maven is evil and decentralized generation and consumption is the only valid solution, then there is no discussion left to have, although a clear set of policies is need in either case...

The only evil is to require rules to solve issues that won't occur without them, the simrel is so used to the ""one-dependency-for-all"" that projects simply don't care anymore about dependency management and correct usage of imports as they can easily offload it to others (especially you), the problem is that each of these ""offloads"" takes away autonomy from projects and [increase the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

And to make it clear, it was not me that states "" so we need the rule"" that really feels like an absolute statement than a recommendation... So how can one respond to such as with another absolute statement?
Sad enough if **you** made such a statement is fine if **other** do so they are always promote the absolute evil ...

> We already know this is not true - otherwise I wouldn't have had to spend time respinning stuff to get rid of dup gson.

Sorry I told the corresponding projects long before the issue happens that they use a wrong version range, but it was ignored so please don't twist the cause with the problem here, so these ""issues"" where not introduced by the fact that we have had duplicate versions, the duplicate versions where introduced because they **where explicitly requested**!

And think what, it was finally fixed (to some small extend) as I have recommended many times before and it **just worked**! So we don't need more _rules_, we need more _recommendations_ in how to handle such situations properly beside from ""I found something on SO/Google/outdated blog post/...  that seem to fix my issue even though I don't understand why"".

The problem is that a _solution_ was proposed before the problem was _understood_, and that's a major problem in software development in general. So everything that starts with ""we must do this"" is obviously nothing focused in a finding solution because it already implies it... but that might be a personal feeling of me.

> From what I understand the solution you've recommended is that each project use a project-unique name for their generated ""wrappers"", that the generated wrappers version all their package exports, and that no other bundle or feature ever reference those wrapper names.

It was claimed that there is no recommendation, so I tried to give some general advice how such situation (purely from a technical point of view) are handled in a flexible way. Whether or not this is assumed ""best"" is (for me) out of scope, because this depends on so many other factors.

At least it solves what was implied as a problem here as ""how we can properly coordinate versions of libraries in SimRel when projects independently of each other generate wrappers for non OSGi-libraries"" ... maybe is misunderstood the problem, or there are other concerns not addressed, this is not clear to me at this point.

So to summarize, I think this is a very good approach, and it would solve the problem, where the details might wary (e.g. depending on the deployment strategies used, a ""product"" has different demands to a ""plugin"" or a ""library"" type)

> Unfortunately no one has been doing that. 

I'm doing that from day 1 where this feature was added to Tycho+m2e and this is already quite a long time now. But the feature was designed to give liberty to their users to use it in a different way, so it is not the only way.

> In fact the default behavior (without a recipe) doesn't do that either.

The defaults are the smallest possible valuable increment, as every default it can work for many cases but fail for others. nerveless **you can insert any instructions** here including what often is refereed to as a ""receipe"", there is literally no restriction!

>  This appears to me a formula where 70 projects will actually and most definitely produce 70 variants of the ""same library"". 

First you propose that each project will use all the dependencies what is just not the case and as mentioned before, if it is very common to use such a lib, it is much more valuable to add such metadata in the library directly, wrapping was never meant as a general purpose solution, it is some kind of band-aid for libs you want to prototype, or no one will produce new release or alike, nerveless you can of course use it for other ways. and if you combine this with the Target-Reference-Location you can even share this among as many projects as you like.

> Unfortunately, each variant of the 'same library"" might use a different recipe, e.g., optional imports are the default, but probably not correct, so some might do that differently. 

The point is that this literally does not matter, as such a wrapping never ever (well at least if you want to save you from trouble), should become part of your bundle-contract, you simply do import-package with proper version range and then your result will not depend on that (probably wrong shaped) wrapping!

So if I build something (like the simrel), I probably even keep a list of correctly and audited wrappings for a certain lib, or some time later there will be a new release of that lib that already carry the data, it simply do not matter for the artifact that use this for **the sole purpose of compile and development** from a different source!

> Which one(s) end up aggregated and actually installed appears mostly non-deterministic as well.

Software usually always is deterministic. So if there is something that behaves that way it might be worth to fix that.

> I don't see any technical risks for SimRel, though perhaps I've overlooked them.

The problem is, that there is already a ""rule"" that one should not depend on content from ""the simrel"" but if I remember correctly we have already had some issues because people simply do, especially we had dependencies from mylin / old orbits releases specifically see:

https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator/blob/b5b94800896102d044d232165e8f72e2aac4f5da/eclipse.platform.releng.prereqs.sdk/eclipse-sdk-prereqs.target#L75-L79

also we have happens-before relationship already here:
https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator/blob/b5b94800896102d044d232165e8f72e2aac4f5da/eclipse.platform.releng.prereqs.sdk/eclipse-sdk-prereqs.target#L49

So from a project point of view (even though maybe convenient) there is a high risk of unnoticed dependencies, even worse, once you have installed such service, you can hardly get rid of it, so from now on we:

1. Have to maintain Orbit release
2. Even older releases because some (accidentally) still rely on it 
3. Soon the ""new central wrapping service"" that will let people think it might be easier to use that service instead of helping projects maintain OSGi meta-data at first place.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIdEFis5bS8T5/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1.  create a local Mylyn workspace and change some code but not committing the changes back to the repository

    `
    <dist.qualifier>'N'yyyyMMdd-HHmm</dist.qualifier>
    <dist.timestampProvider>jgit</dist.timestampProvider>
` the jars get a timestamp from the last commit

3. use file:///... to install this in an other Eclipse Installation using a bundle pool.
4. use the pipeline to build a new nightly/staging version

Now you have in the bundle pool a jar with uncommitted changes but can not overwrite it.

Thougths?

Here's one example of how it would work:

The most relevant thing here is that you can specify nightly, milestone, or release and whether to promote the build.  E.g., for a PR build, one does not need to sign, probably shouldn't in fact because it slows down the build and doing that allows a contributor to grab and redistribute signed content with their ""hooks"" in it, and should not publish it.  

The versions are controlled by the version of a specified/designate feature so one only needs to properly increment feature versions to provide, in the end, new release versions.  One can also control which bundles/features are listed in the documentation; e.g., omit the 3rd party things.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/116/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Maybe it would be good to create a dedicated issue for the baseline thing.   Oomph's setup infrastructure also allows a baseline to be set up using a targlets and this can use the previous release update site directly.  Not only that, it reuses the bundle pool for building the API baseline and it's highly likely that most of the bundles will already be in the pool such that it's hyper fast.  I'm not sure if you care about the details of how the API baseline is set?

I.e., just specify the root features, which pulls in the transitive requirements, so this assumes all the plugins are required from these roots.  The URL, once there is a release, will always be the latest release.  So not much ever needs to change, nothing special is needed as input, and it's super fast...

[@eGit](https://github.com/eGit) committers: what do you think?
Sure, if Mylyn wants to maintain and improve it, that's perfectly fine with me. We never did much with it. I think the only new development in the past couple of years in the Mylyn connector was my changing the repository set-up dialog to support GitHub PATs better.
However, see below:
	•	Keep org.eclipse.egit.github.core where it currently is; don't move that one to Mylyn.
	•	Also move org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui to Mylyn.

Matthias, we are moving the EGit GitHub connector into Mylyn. WDYT?

PR is here:
https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/pull/38
<https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/pull/38>
This PR also copies org.eclipse.egit.github.core, which is not part of the Mylyn connector. It is a completely separate thing and does not depend on Mylyn or EGit at all.
I would prefer that one to stay where it is, in the org.eclipse.egit.github repository. Reasons:
	1.	It is independent.
	2.	It uses a BREE of JAVA 8 for Android compatibility.
	3.	It should be versioned, built, tested, and published independently.
In particular it should be published to maven central.
Some technical things:
The connector makes use of EGit internal classes. EGit has removed it from x-friends in MANIFEST.MF. Expect a lot of PDE warnings about discouraged accesses.
I would expect that these accesses to internal classes would be analyzed and be removed eventually. We'd have to figure out what stable APIs EGit core and UI would have to provide instead.
EGit does not guarantee anything about internal classes.
Bundle org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui, which was removed in the EGit repository in commit 12a21a6c, should probably also be moved to Mylyn.
There, too, we have internal accesses.
Cheers,
Thomas

I thought that we use https://git.eclipse.org/r/www.eclipse.org/mylyn.git and yes we should update the site.
The contributors page get an error because we have no bugzilla tickets (all moved to archive).
Btw we should also plan how and when we move the wiki pages see Mail [eclipse.org-committers] Service shutdown plans - update.
Should we open separate Tickets for this?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIdEFis5cpKc3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We need to activate GitHub pages to use the repository [mylyn-website](https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/mylyn-website) and ask for the right redirect. I have create the first [two issues](https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/mylyn-website/issues) so feel free to add some more.

Unfortunately, I have not yet published my changes.
> Also, it seems https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn.docs has kind of split off to have an independent life of it's own, and it can't easily exist in the same workspace because each has a different *.target file.

It seems to me that it would be better to have Mylyn and Mylyn Docs in two separate GitHub organizations. With all the consequences like duplicate setups, but also the better visibility of the independence of Mylyn Docs from the rest of Mylyn.

The .github repository doesn't make that clear enough to me.

I [just added](https://github.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/pull/24) most of the features of SimRel to the EPP, but I found that a bunch of features in the Mylyn update site are not being contributed to SimRel.

On a quick pass AFAICT these items don't appear in SimRel but do appear in [Mylyn](https://download.eclipse.org/mylyn/updates/milestone/S202305240755/) (as contributed to 2023-06 M3):

- org.eclipse.egit.mylyn (xref  #134)
- org.eclipse.mylyn.bugzilla_feature
- org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.activity
- org.eclipse.mylyn.github.feature
- org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.index

I assume especially the egit and github features are or should one day be part of SimRel and the EPPs.

The locked down versions ensure that the feature really makes into into the SimRel p2 directory.

*But* it still causes downstream problems, for example if I add a line into the product that says:

`<feature id=""org.eclipse.egit.mylyn"" installMode=""root""/>`

I will get install error like this when trying to build EPP:

```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-packaging-plugin:2.7.1:build-qualifier-aggregator (default-build-qualifier-aggregator) on project epp.package.cpp: Execution default-build-qualifier-aggregator of goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-packaging-plugin:2.7.1:build-qualifier-aggregator failed: Could not resolve feature org.eclipse.egit.mylyn_null; Path to dependency:
[ERROR] 
```

(there is indeed nothing after `Path to dependency:`) 

Which means I would have to be explicit about version numbers in the product files.

Since egit has dealt with the removal of the bundles this way in the past, perhaps we should be renaming (id only) these 2 features going forward? For `org.eclipse.egit.mylyn` it would have secondary benefit of moving it into mylyn's namespace.

We can see that while the bugzilla.id plugin registers the template, the bugzilla.core  registers the repository kind, so when that's not installed, we see an exception.

I think the bugzilla.ide plugin should require the bugzilla.core, and probably bugzilla.ui...

Every entry in this list is either not installable (Foglyn is disabled, see #166 for probable reason, others fail to install due to version mismatches), installs but is completely non-functional (Mantis installs, but then a lot of Guava errors are encountered after restart), or installs an older version (all Eclipse provided ones are old version 3.25.2.v20200814-0512).

In the error log I can see it accessing the 3.25 snapshot of Mylyn to fill this discovery window, I guess that the URLs in https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/blob/adbfdf433caeccd3e808cad3aabb37c52d447411/org.eclipse.mylyn.discovery-directory/plugin.xml#L80 need updating?

That never materialized and maintaining this up to date list for the connectors proved to be a maintenance burden with little effect. Meanwhile most connectors are also listed in the Eclipse Marketplace and maintained there by their owners.

So a radical proposal for removing this maintenance burden from the Mylyn team:
- try and make Mylyn connectors a category in the Eclipse Marketplace
- create API for questioning a specific category in the Marketplace plugin
- simplify the mylyn discovery plugin to query the Eclipse Marketplace directly rather than duplicating the maintenance effort.

You may need to run garbage collector to see the ""Not properly disposed SWT resource"" when just closing the view. 

Of course many users will still be closing this new view early on as they won't know where it came from, so having exceptions around it simply closing would be unfortunate. However, because the ""Widget is disposed"" only seems to happen if you have any tasks in the view it may be deemed less severe.

Yes, they require more effort to sync but guarantees that changes done in any Eclipse IDE will use the same settings. I know that some people create linked .pref file that points to a common file, but I have no practical experience with this solution.

Please, don't. People will just stop thinking what are they catching at all. Trivial example is `InvocationTargetException` and `InterruptedException` : they need different handling by contract.

I understand, for some cases type for variable declaration looks excessive, but do we want all the code to always use `var` ?

It is right that currently the workflow always fails if the license-vetting could not succeed.
I can look into adding a configuration option to not fail the build if the license check has failed, next week, but it might not be straight forward because I have to check if this might break assumption for downstream code.
But I then would be concerned about being not aware of license-check failures, because I assume that nobody really checks the workflow logs if interaction is required.
Not vetted licenses in-between releases are not a problem AFAIK, but when you perform a release all dependencies should be vetted and a failure in the license-check is IMHO a good heads up.

In general you are free to ignore the failing license-check workflow, when you want to merge a PR. That was actually the main reason why I created a separate workflow independent of the regular build+text workflow, so that one can see immediately that there is only a license-vetting issue, but technically the change is fine because the build+test workflow succeeds.
If one does the license-check in the same workflow as building and testing it would indeed be annoying because one would never know if there are technical issues occur later in the pipeline, hidden by the license-check failure. But due to the separate failure you can distinguish pressingly. 

It looks like you could exclude a failing license check from blocking the merge:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule

Personally I think that this is a good compromise. It does not fail your build+tests, but you are still aware of the situation.
But of course if you insist I can build in an option to not fail the workflow if license vetting fails.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIdEFis5gUFhF/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I've come up with a working PoC using TestContainer to launch Jenkins as docker container and using that container to run a couple of of JUnit tests successfully. 

It runs fine under Eclipse but when I try build Mylyn with Maven the build blows up on the modified target file.
`[ERROR] Failed to resolve target definition file:/E:/workspaces/eclipse-mylyn/mylyn-main/git/org.eclipse.mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn-target/mylyn-e4.28.target: Artifact MavenArtifactFacade [...], IncludeDependencyScope = [compile, runtime, test], MissingManifestStrategy = GENERATE, IncludeSource = true is not a valid jar file`

Also I don't know if it will run using the Mylyn Jenkins instance used for the builds?

Is this something worth exploring more? Or is it just a wild idea?

I think we should ask Helpdesk the following thinks.

1. is it possible to have a Docker in Docker image for the build
2. if the answer to 1) is yes we need a network so that the two container can talk to each other

So I'm wondering if the docker engine could be installed on the Jenkins server to be used as a possible  replacement for mylyn.org?

No they do not talk to each other. But the all register to a list of available services.

We need to run the entire build in a Docker image and the container running the unit test must have access to the newly created Jenkins/Bugzilla test instance.

> If this is not possible, is there any other way a Test instance for the servers could be set up on the Eclipse infrastructure that can be accessed by the Mylyn build?

I don't know if there is a place for a virtual infrastructure that can be accessed from https://ci.eclipse.org/mylyn where we can have custom Docker images with our Bugzilla/Jenkins instances.

I think the problems you are experiencing are due to the multipass setup being designed for the mylyn.local domain. This domain is the one I can access from my home network and used in the the bugzilla.conf.

From within my home network I can not access the public domain because of the config in my router. I have changed the bugzilla setup so please try it again

It looks like this was an over application of the pattern to rename the feature. The feature was already renamed in the 3.26.1 release and had a p2.inf in 0f0912e58cedf4b212f5f7f2e35f8bc48cfc5541

PHP doesn't update, but that is because of PDT Myln update is not available (as done and announced in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.build/+/203130/5/pdt.aggrcon).

`I am working with projects organized hierarchically on disk. For example:

foo-parent
  foo-module1
    src
      resources
  foo-module2
    src
      resources

This structure give 3 projects in Eclipse:

foo-parent
foo-module1
foo-module2

Note that such project layout is quite popular in Maven community.

Now, when resource in foo-module1/src/resources is changed, e.g. using one of Eclipse editors, this same resource is forcefully shown in the package explorer two times, first in foo-module1/src/resources and second in foo-parent/foo-module1/src/resources

This clutters package explorer view and also forcing user to deal with this clutter, basically distracting him form the main task.`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/247/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Lots of people don't know about filters.  You can do that via the properties of a project:

Here I have two nested projects but I don't want to show them twice, so in the parent project, I filter out the children of the nested projects so that I still see the placeholder folder, but not the ""duplicate"" contents.  Here's a filter expression which uses regular expressions:

Yes, we use Gson and thus com.google.common.reflect.TypeToken to convert the REST responses from Bugzilla Rest and Gitlab Connector. This is also used in Common SDK for the test configuration.

If we should no longer use Gson what should we use for serialization and deseralisation?

User Story/Case:
Any plugin can define an extension point (have to look up which one) that specifies the bug/issue tracker where tickets/bugs can be opened. Then when said plugin dumps an error in the Error Log, selecting the error and selecting the context menu should allow one to report the log message and some extra information as a bug in the appropriate issue tracker, auto-checking for duplicates first. Hence the stacktrace search as that is deemed a sufficiently unique identifier of the error.

The Goal was/is to make it easier for people to report issues and allow a more data driven approach to bug fix prioritization.
This scaffolding provided by the Mylyn ecosystem with the example implementations should be retained in my view.
This provides tremendous time savings for testers and early adopters of new software in the Mylyn ecosystem.
Hope I can find the time to dig in the old docs and do a write up.

As intermediaire solution:
Remove from Help menu, retain UI in ErrorLog context menu and update code to point to new issue trackers.

In general one could also express a generic requirement (that's e.g. not a package) via a `Require-Capability`:
https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.module.html#framework.module.dependencies

But I don't know the specific issue Mylin faces. :)

Then you could configure Tycho to include all dependencies in a built p2-repo, but remove artifacts provided in other p2-repos listed in the Target-Platform and add those repositories as references.
With that one gets a self-contained repository of minimal size, like for example in m2e:

There is an intention in #344 to simplify build scripts and have only one maven call. The intention itself looks rational to me, but I blocked the merge of mentioned PR to not break the working state of things. Since it may be not obvious for other committers how this or similar change can break the M1 contribution - I can say we are at risk.

At the current time point I can suggest to delay both #344 and this one and contribute Mylyn Docs to from master as it is now.

Initially my plan was to contribute [federated Mylyn(+Docs) solution](https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/347) for M1, but it still needs more work.

However, I still have a hope to contribute federated Mylyn after 2024-03 M1, and it will have the following breaking changes:
* all versions aligned with Mylyn, i.e. 4.2.0
* all feature identifiers modified to `org.eclipse.mylyn.*.feature` form
* all modules with `MANIFEST.MF` converted to `eclipse-plugin` packaging
* dedicated test bundles extracted where needed

I know, that people don't like changes, but today this unification is the only form to keep the Mylyn contribution alive and actual.
For these who would like to see Mylyn Docs supported, but without so annoying breaking changes there are two options:
* contribute effort to keep ""maintains"" branches
* fill Mylyn project with support budget","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIdEFis5wYfM3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Personally I don't use Bugzilla anymore (but I also don't use Mylyn actively, it is just part of the Eclipse Modelling Tools I need), so my opinion does not really count, but as far as I can tell, Bugzilla seem not to be used that much out there.

Btw. I have also analyzed the problem a bit further and think that the OSGi metadata embedded in `org.apache.commons.commons-logging` are wrong.
The relevant excerpt from its MANIFEST.MF:
```
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.apache.commons.commons-logging

```

As you can see org.slf4j.spi is not imported, but as you can see in the stack-trace (and in the code) it is referenced:
```

That is not the point.
We use  `mvn clean verify` for the Mylyn build, but Mylyn.docs needs `mvn clean deploy` to push the build result into the remote repository.

Why do you fix set the version to the old version (3.0.48.202308291007) for org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext and org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.textile in the pom of org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.maven?

We have the following calls to maven for builder Mylyn

```
mvn \
clean \
verify \
-B \
$MAVEN_PROFILES \
-Dmaven.repo.local=$WORKSPACE/.m2/repository \
-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true \
-Dmaven.test.error.ignore=true \
-Ddash.fail=false \
-Dorg.eclipse.justj.p2.manager.build.url=$JOB_URL \
-Dbuild.type=$BUILD_TYPE \
-Dgit.commit=$GIT_COMMIT
```
and Mylyn.Docs
```
mvn clean deploy -U -B -V -e -s /home/jenkins/.m2/settings-deploy-ossrh-docs.xml -Psign -Possrh -Dmaven.repo.local=$WORKSPACE/.m2/repository -Dtycho.buildqualifier.format=yyyyMMddHHmm -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true -Dmaven.test.error.ignore=true -Ddash.fail=false -Dgpg.passphrase=""${KEYRING_PASSPHRASE}"" -Dnexus.autoReleaseAfterClose=""${PERFORM_RELEASE}""
```

1. We can try to change the man build of Mylyn with the following changes.
-  replace `verify \`with `deploy \`
-  add  
```
-U -V -e -s /home/jenkins/.m2/settings-deploy-ossrh-docs.xml \
-Possrh -Dgpg.passphrase=""${KEYRING_PASSPHRASE}"" \
 -Dnexus.autoReleaseAfterClose=""${PERFORM_RELEASE}""
```
2.  try if we can  run the original maven mylyn.docs command without the clean parameter and we add `-f mylyn.docs/pom.xml`

But how can we make sure that with our test we did not create problems in maven central?

Thougths?

Yes, it seems we did.

Does this make task list not functional? I hope it does not.
I don't want to change dependencies in a day before release, it is too risky for the rest of functionality.
We can consider having service release to fix this issue or just schedule it for 4.3.0

I have been happily using these connectors for many years without problems so it surprises me to see them go.

When I try to add a repository in Mylyn 4.2.0 in Eclipse 2023-12 I only get options for ""GitHub Gists"", ""GitHub Issues"", ""GitHub Pull Requests"". In Eclipse Marketplace there is no connector for Bugzilla and the one for Trac wants to uninstall and downgrade most of Mylyn for Trac connector to be installed.

The section in the user guide for connectors <https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/wiki/User-Guide#task-repository-connectors> also refers to Bugzilla and Trac. However the links are to a read-only wiki at https://wiki.eclipse.org which suggests that the information is well out of date.

The release notes <https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/releases> don't mention Bugzilla being removed. In fact 4.2.0 talks about some code clean up.

The release notes for 4.1.0 mention deleting references to Trac in Mylyn but it is not clear from that whether the connector will no longer work or whether these references are just being moved from Mylyn core to the Trac connector.

I am not sure if there is somewhere else to keep track of these Mylyn developments, but I suggest the User Guide should describe the recommended connectors to use and which ones to stop using after a particular version of Mylyn. I suggest the User Guide should also describe how to install the Bugzilla connector if it still exists. The User Guide should also update all links to https://wiki.eclipse.org as it will be shut down soon.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/476/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That update site worked <https://download.eclipse.org/mylyn/updates/release/4.2.0>. I have always used Eclipse Marketplace (from the Help menu) to install Mylyn connectors. The Mylyn Trac connector is still in Eclipse Marketplace, as is Mylyn 3.23, which is confusing. There have been 254 downloads in the last month of Mylyn 3.23 and 2 downloads last month of Mylyn Trac Connector 3.8.

In the past I do not remember having to install Bugzilla connector separately to Mylyn. But my memory of this is not reliable which is why I was looking in the User Guide for installation instructions.

Another suggestion would be to update text at <https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/mylyn#details> to recommend people install through update site rather than through Marketplace. I notice one comment on Marketplace complaining that task list doesn't show on a recent eclipse version when using the marketplace install.

1) Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers (includes Incubating components)
Version: 2024-03 (4.31.0)
Build id: 20240307-1437

2) Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers	4.31.0.20240307-1200	epp.package.jee	Eclipse Packaging Project

3) Mylyn Tasks Connector: GitHub	6.4.0.v20240209-1319	org.eclipse.mylyn.github.feature.feature.group	Eclipse Mylyn

### Problem : 

I'm encountering an error when attempting to add a new task repository of type ""GitHub Gist."" Regardless of the URL format used, I receive the message: `Enter a valid server URL.`

Here are the specific URLs I've tried (replacing <my-github-user> with my actual username):

    https://gist.github.com (Base URL)
    https://gist.github.com/<my-github-user> (My User Gists)
    https://gist.github.com/<other-valid-github-user> (Another User's Gists)
    https://gist.github.com/discover (Discover Gists)

Additionally, I have attempted using:

    Valid user credentials (username and password)
    Valid access token

Unfortunately, using any of these options prevents the expected functionality. The buttons ""Validate Settings"" and ""Finish"" remain disabled.

### How to reproduce:

1. Go to the contextual menu in the `Task List` tab, then click `New` and then `Query...`

Do you mean that you are barely taking ownership of this project, I guess?

Where is the code you are referring too Here? I would like to take a look, may you facilitate a link?

I am an intensive user of the Web Templates Task Connector to connect with the SourceForge ticket tracker and would like to continue doing so. This Task Connector was part of the incubation repository and I can see that this repository has been archived now. Meanwhile I can keep the Web Templates Connector working by keeping the Mylyn components it depends on at version 3.25.2. In that way it still works well with Eclipse 2024-03, despite loosing the git integration.

Are there any plans to revive the Web Templates Task Connector? Or to develop another generic Task Connector that can be configured to connect with a REST API? Because SourceForge and many other issue tracking systems provide a REST interface.

Cheers,

Henk

The most straightforward way to see your favorite connector revived is to re-contribute it back to the Mylyn repository.

There are a couple of guava classes used by wikitext that don't have direct (or even simple ) replacement code. Specifically CharMatcher/Escapers

I'm not sure what's the best approach at this point:

1. Leave Guava jar in place (wikitext code is the only user)?
2. Take the time and effort to come up with custom alternatives?
3. Extract the appropriate classes from Guava and add them to wikitext (with appropriate mods)?

I have a working Poc of the third option, 25 classes in total. It's an ugly hack, but it works. Potentially would allow for a refactor/rewrite in the future.

Thoughts?

It could be or not. I've been replacing Guava usages with new Java versions API and keeping Guava for the rest (e.g https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/commit/4fd84e30acddcf4c224a4a63b4487119f343aa14 https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/commit/9ad02738c52b58fbcad91743f3db0f1355c7dc18  https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/commit/2f0cc660aa4f8d50a11e37de7fc151b59bbc651d https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/commit/803292b246c65c115333d12b2730a3b9759bb397 and others), in that case - it's a slow reduction of guava usage without coping code to be maintained by the project.

Which made me wonder why an artifact in the .m2 cache is needed at all.  So I asked about here:

https://github.com/eclipse-m2e/m2e-core/discussions/1777#discussioncomment-9685967

Based on that answer, it seems to me that we can just add the m2e nature/builder to the two projects such that the two org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.maven  dependencies resolve to the workspace projects.

I can experiment further to verify that this fixes the problem.  I just wanted to confirm that there is no some other reason for doing a full build (which takes really long which is really quite annoying).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/552/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Specifically via these dependencies:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/assets/208716/e58a3aba-f867-465e-85c0-19bfc808ef24)

Searching the source, I see these bundles import the packages:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/assets/208716/a728db11-1dea-4265-9b79-4e565179e630)

I can find what might be updates/replacements for the packages here:

- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gerrit/gerrit-extension-api/
- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gerrit/gerrit-plugin-api/
- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gwt/gwt-user/
- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gerrit/gwtjsonrpc/
- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gerrit/gwtorm/

But I don't know that anything from the above is compatible and some of their jars look like dumping grounds that include dependencies, like this one that looks like a dependency closure:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/assets/208716/177a8c7b-f330-4d96-b2a8-d49fec1f0834)


I'm concerned of the risk of using 13 year old libraries that work with passwords for authentication for which we have essentially no ability to update to newer versions to fix any security problems that may exist or may arise.

I'm fine to help add newer bundles to Orbit, but I'm at a bit of a loss which things are actually need and would provide suitable updated alternatives.

The 3.9.5 version of gerrit-extension-api provides quite a bit and doesn't have so many dependencies, though I've made then all optional here in order to build the jar:

Mylyn Gerrit support won't be as important because Eclipse now use Github and Gitlab.

Maybe we don't have the resources and should ask for help.

We've been through this before. It was https://github.com/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn.reviews.

Gerrit is the only supported ReviewsConnector.
But is it worth creating ReviewsConnector for Github and Gitlab, since they have pull/merge requests?
Same for BuildConnector and Jenkins.

In the tests I remove some known attributes where I know that the Value must not match (like creation timestamp) all other are in the compare. So If we have a failure I think we have a newer gitlab Instance with a changed behavior.
Yor setup should fav 17.4.0 and no longer 16.11.1.

If you want to make sure that I have missed to change the testdata, you can change line 117 of mylyn_setup.yml.

If not , I can verify this next year.  :smile:","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn/issues/comments/IC_kwDOIdEFis6Y7alt/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This Develocity is freely available for use by the Eclipse Mylyn project and all other Eclipse projects.

On this Develocity instance, Eclipse Mylyn will have access not only to all of the published build scans but also to other aggregate data features such as:


* Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time
* Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures
* Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests

This will also enable you to (optionally) use build time optimization features, such as (remote) build caching and Predictive Test Selection.
