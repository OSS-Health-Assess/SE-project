I have pushed your changes into a new branch. Please work from there.

I found out when trying to run the unit tests (there are 37000 unit tests!!) that windowbuilder mutates lists while iterating them.

Take a look for example at 
 
    org.eclipse.wb.internal.core.utils.ast.AstNodeUtils.removeDanglingNodes(Iterable<? extends ASTNode> nodes)

The replacement:

    List<FieldDeclaration> fields = Lists.newArrayList(field_1, field_2);

with

    List<FieldDeclaration> fields = Arrays.asList(field_1, field_2);

breaks

```
  /**
   * Removes ""dangling"" {@link ASTNode}-s.
   */
  public static void removeDanglingNodes(Iterable<? extends ASTNode> nodes) {
    Iterator<? extends ASTNode> I = nodes.iterator();

      if (isDanglingNode(node)) {

I am not sure if it does or not.

What kind of snippet code do you need? I got none but the default SWT code.

But I did figure out that it only crashes if I add a composite over the top parent and into the void, that is when it stops responding and crashes. But that is only in design view, even if I make it close to the maximum size of the top parent, it still does the same thing. But if I do it in code, it is find. I think the problem may be something with the updating or something. So I believe it may be a bug as it has trouble calculating if you update the size above the top most parent.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjExNDQyOA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sorry I thought that you were using Java 16. For JDK17 you can have a look at issue #47 (https://github.com/eclipse/windowbuilder/issues/47)

You have to add a new argument, but it seems that there is a problem with this JVM argument, so you have to create a bash file (or a bat file if you use Windows).

Yes, I am almost sure it is due to the JDK17 (JEP 403: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals)
It seems **--illegal-access=permit** does not work anymore ...
I tried to add **--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED** to eclipse.ini but without success Eclipse does not start with this JVM argument.

So I created my own script to start Eclipse with **--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED**

> #!/bin/bash
> /jvm/openjdk/jdk-17/bin/java -jar \
> -noverify \
> -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=11 \
> -Dosgi.dataAreaRequiresExplicitInit=true \
> -Dorg.eclipse.swt.graphics.Resource.reportNonDisposed=true \
> -Xms256m \
> -Xmx2048m \
> -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni \
> --add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM \
> --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED \

comment,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/52,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc44SOz4,windowbuilder,944303352,52,NA,lcaron,1170014,Laurent CARON,,NA,2021-10-15T13:29:40Z,2021-10-15T13:29:40Z,"Hi Tim

I'll try to explain the best I can with my bad English. 

WindowBuilder is using a very old library to manipulate bytecode (cglib, not maintained anymore). Since JDK 9, this library generates a lot of warning, but it works. Since JDK 16 it breaks WindowBuilder, except if you add the VM parameter `--illegal-access=permit.`
Since Java 17 this parameter is no longer supported, so **WB is not working anymore**.

We are trying to replace cglib by bytebuddy but it's a tricky and long work.

**a) Should this type of problem be normal?**
Normal, no. Logical yes.

**2) Is there an easy way to get this going on my PC too, or do you have to create a custom environment made by you too?**
There is a solution: you can download Eclipse IDE with an embedded JRE (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). Eclipse will run with this JRE instead of 
your own JDK. Because this JRE is OpenJDK 16, once you have added the parameter --illegal-access=permit it will work flawlessly.
(the installation I proposed to you contains Eclipse IDE For Java, Windowbuilder and OpenJDK 16 embedded. The VM parameter has been added to the eclipse.ini file)

**3) Shouldn't be launching and using an add-on in Eclipse (or generally in any software) be easy in simple?**
See answer 2 (download Eclipse with embedded JRE)

**4) Will there be an update where WindowBuilder shouldn't be that difficult to use? (except if I have done something wrong on BOTH my PC and Surface)**
Yes I am working on this topic, and I hope that I'll finish it in the next few weeks.

**5) What JRE (or SE or JDK whatever I don't understand the term) am I using with that now? Is it using JDK 17, because that is what I would like to use.
(If this is my fault on both devices) What the hell made all of this so difficult?**

For the moment, the only solution is to run Eclipse with JDK 16 or lower. You can use JDK 17 in your projects if you declare this JRE (Window > Preferences > Installed JREs), but not for running the IDE.


I hope I answered your questions.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc44SOz4/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

First of all I'm unclear as to the status of an arm version of Eclipse, I would prefer to stay with the Intel version if it's not production ready. The main question would be the status of plugins for eclipse. I assume plain java only plugins will be ok but I was not sure about SWT. I don't use SWT in my Java applications but if WindowBuilder requires it and there isn't an arm version of SWT / Windobuilder then obviously that would mean sticking with intel code for now. 

If rosetta2 allows me to run all my current dev tools that will be fine, it's just a little fuzzy about how rosetta2 works. I understand that is converts apps when they are installed into Apple Silicon arm code. So for example if I unzip a copy of ANT into folder will that count as installing. I did read an article about opening a terminal in intel compatibility mode.

At the moment there are so many variables and information overload I simply don't know which path to follow. All ARM or all Intel.

If anyone has arm Eclipse with WindowBuilder running or has any experiences which would help my decision making that would be perfect.

Can you mix and match - install arm version of Java JDK and Intel version of Eclipse for example ?

It’s about 3 weeks before my machine arrives so I’m trying to research as much as I can in advance.

Question - what does the M2 in the eclipse link signify ?

My shopping list (setup on new Mac) will be

Java 8 JDK
Java 11 JDK
Apache Tomcat 9 & 10
Eclipse IDE Enterprise Edition 2021-?? latest
WindowBuilder Pro Plugin
JasperReports Studio Plugin
MySQL Database
ANT Command Line Build Tool
MAVEN Command Line Build Tool

The latter 2 items are a bit of a question mark. If I unzip the intel binary into a non Applications folder will rosetta2 convert them to Apple Silicon format.

The more I think about it the more I think of questions. You say that Eclipse and JDK should both be either Intel or ARM - however lets say I need Java 11 arm for Eclipse for Java 11 x86 for ANT - how on earth do you install both and if you do how do you distinguish between them. Sounds like a recipe for disaster if you get mixed up.

Thanks for you reply.

I use WindowBuilder all the time and it's a **must have requirement for me**. Shame I don't know anyone with a M1 based machine who can experiment for me. Java (arm), Eclipse (arm) and of course WindowBuilder arm. I know Eclipse has it's own JDK bundled with it, but would it care if the external JDK's which you can defined within preferences have to be the same architecture as well ? So for example I could fire up the Intel version of Eclipse and define JDK11 and JDK8 as external arm versions. I seem to be going round and round in circles trying to come up with a strategy which is going to get me up and running in a stable environment. Of course there is the issue that a new Mac is not a minor investment and I don't want to end up with something which isn't going to be useable from a development perspective.

Are you saying there won’t be an specific support for arm type processors with WindowBuilder ? Is windowbuilder all java based itself or is there some native code in it ?

The stuff at https://github.com/eclipse/windowbuilder/tree/master/org.eclipse.wb.os.macosx/native/mac

I downloaded the aarch64 version for MacOS from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/>

Then installed WindowBuilder from the Eclipse Marketplace.

So far its just working for me. I don’t use SWT components in my application.

I suppose the only thing which I don’t know is something which simply does not exist yet would be support for dark mode but I’m very pleased with it. Certainly much faster on the M1

Previously all the color pickers were available at all times and there was no easy way to hide them, other than removing them from the WindowBuilder. 
Previously the color chooser (for swing widgets) would display the following Color chooser dialog:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92920738/142982050-89ce1ea7-4a00-4ee2-88f8-47683c6d6feb.png)

I have therefore created a preference page in the WindowBuilder category called ""Color Chooser"". On this preference page it is now able to select which of the color pickers to include in this dialog.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92920738/142982224-24e3a93e-0155-4867-a3c3-c85d534f3bb1.png)

Along with this I have also added a ""Custom Colors"" color picker that allows the user to specify any color that may or may not appear on any of the other color pickers. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92920738/142982420-765fed69-5a1e-4c9c-a546-fb1082f88f52.png)

Another small addition to this Color Chooser dialog is that of the warning on the ""System colors"" tab. This warning has been added to warn the user of the change that may occur in the selected colors depending current system.

Therefore to have both toolbars visible would cause confusion and interference. 

The problem was that there was no way to hide this toolbar from our application without altering the Windowbuilder itself. 

To solve this issue I have added a class called DesignCompositeManager that is used within Windowbuilder to determine whether to hide or show the WB toolbar. 

This is done by creating the DesignCompositeManager object and passing it into the constructor of the DesignerEditor in our application. 

The default for Windowbuilder looks as follows:

I was just honestly guessing what to do. Some guides online that I followed for previous problems when I wanted to 'completely delete Eclipse' was to delete those two directories along with the Eclipse installation. It helped me with past problems, so I thought of doing it with this one. 

> Mmmh weird, this problem occured with previous versions of WB. Did you try with the latest snapshot ?

If by latest snapshot you mean the latest WindowBuilder, I tried the 'Current' version available according to [this link](https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/download.php). I will try the 'Upcoming' version later and report what happens on that.

If you mean the latest Eclipse version, I am running the latest version available on Manjaro, with Eclipse's 'Check for updates' function yielding 'No updates found'.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc46jdkY/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yup. That's consistent with my installation. It works now with a JDK16 version with the 1.9.8 version.

I.e. we need to be able to only show the basic actions in the context menu such as the Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete actions. 

Solution description: I have added preferences to the DesignContextMenuProvider class in the buildContextMenu method. These preferences are not available to the user but can be set by using the InstanceScope. The default for these preferences are set to true and therefore will always show all the actions as previously defined unless the developer incorporating windowbuilder into their product sets the preferences to false.

The two preferences are:
1. To hide the same actions as are found on the Windowbuilder toolbar, i.e. the Test and Refresh actions
2. To hide object specific actions that vary depending on which object the context menu is invoked

Following are screenshots of the context menu:
When preferences are set to true

IIRC we following is necessary:

1.) a release record: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.windowbuilder/releases/

3.) Update the Simrel record
4.) Maybe need a release review from the foundation

With Java <16 there was no problem. I also tried a fresh installation with the latest built to no avail.

I can reproduce this error on MacOSX and Windows using
Eclipse Adoptium, java.version: 17.0.1
WindowBuilder version: 1.9.7.202112211354

The frame icon has double of is's normal size and close, minimize and maximize button wont show up.

I'm using all latest versions that are available and also did a completly reinstall Eclipse, WindowBuilder als well as JDK 17
Steps to reproduce

1. Go to your Windows settings.
2. Go to ""System"".
3. If not already open, klick on ""Display""
4. Set ""Scaling and arrangement"" to something other than 100%
5. In my case I got an 13.5"", 3000 x 2000 Display where it's 200% scaling factor is necessary.
6. Start Eclipse, open a project, open the file with WindwoBuilder, create what ever frame you want and go to the ""Desing"" page.
7. What is the current bug behavior?

I'm not 100% sure but I thing that even while Eclipse seems to understand that Windows scaling is active, this information is somehow not providet to WindowBuilder. Even when setting auto scaling to 100% at the eclipse.ini file only fontsize and icon size that are part of the Eclipse UI change but NOT those from WindowBuilder.

I also tried to change the properties of Eclipse.exe file with my default Windows Scaliung at 200% and nothing addet to the .ini file. Therefor I searched that file, right klicked on it, went down to properties, then to compatibility and ther on ""change high-DPI settings. There I enabled the overwriting of high-DPI scaling and change it to System (Extended).

Confirm both Windows and (re)start eclipse. Now WindowBuilder shows the right scaling but if you hover your mouse over the ""Source"" and ""Desing"" fields at the bottom left they disappear but you can still klick them. If you press ssome random button or field or just switch to an other application the show back up.
What is the expected correct behavior?

The same as when scaling is at 100%.

I would like to add, that if you use WB with that first **work around** you may get into trouble when running your code. In my case I wondert why my window was not abel to display everyting in it's setted size. I recognized, that if you use Window Builder with a different scaling than 100% Windows also scales up or down the size of elements and text in your frame by the factor you choose in the Windows settings. Windows scaling does **NOT** affect the minimum size yout set for your window. But I'm not sure if it is the same for the prefered size because if you run the code, the frame shows up as it should. Only if you start to downsize it you will notice that its behavior is different than on 100% scaling.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc48NN6J/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I could also post the entire eclipse-Log but there is not much information other than that stacktrace (to be precise: none other)

### To Reproduce
A bit difficult. It needs a 3-Project-Setup and does only occur when using Maven™:
Project 1 (LibProject) is a Standard-Maven-Project. It defines a class `de.custom.CustomFrame` like this:
```java
package de.custom;

import java.awt.Cursor;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class CustomFrame extends JFrame{
	public CustomFrame() {
		this.setCursor(Cursor.getPredefinedCursor(Cursor.CROSSHAIR_CURSOR));
	}
}
```
With this, you do a `mvn install` and **delete the project from the workspace**.

Project 2 (ParentProject) is a Standard-Maven-Project. It defines _nothing_, but exports its entries in the project-properties via Java Build Path → Order and Export → Check 'Maven Dependencies'.

Project 3 (ChildProject) is _not_ a Maven-Project, but a standard Java-Project. It defines Project 2 (ParentProject) as a Project dependency via Java Build Path → Projects → Add → Parent Project. It has a class `my.custom.frame.MyFrame` like this:
```java
package my.custom.frame;

import java.awt.BorderLayout;
import de.custom.CustomFrame;

public class MyFrame extends CustomFrame {
	public MyFrame() {
		buildFrame();
	}

	private void buildFrame() {
		setLayout(new BorderLayout());
		pack();
		setLocationRelativeTo(null);
		setVisible(true);
	}
}
```
When trying to open above class in the WindowBuilder design tab, the error occurs.

I have also exported the projects to a zip, but GitHub won't let me upload it 😢. If you need it, I can try it again later...

### Expected Behaviour
WindowBuilder does not fail and opens the UI. 😃

When I scale up to 175% the Windows 11 display, the windowbuilder in Eclipse gets glitched, see the screenshots attached, also the icons get too oversized, while the rest of eclipse remains good

I am using a 4k 27 inch monitor at resolution of 2560 x 1440p with 175% scale

Apparently, I am also unable to zoom out in B, which means that I can't see the whole application window while building it

B: 175% messed up

After a quick glance, however, I can already tell that this'll be much more than simply doing a search & replace for all GEF classes.

Example:
`org.eclipse.wb.draw2d.geometry.Interval` doesn't seem to exist in GEF classic.

Given the scope of this task, I think it makes sense to split this migration into two parts: Draw2D and GEF.

I've started looking at the Draw2D classes and while it's going to be a lot of work, I think it's definitely possible to get the changes here reintegrated into GEF.

Luckily, there are quite a lot of JUnit tests for both Draw2D and GEF.

Yes, libs would need to be signed (with PGP), this can be achieved with the right Tycho plugin.

In short, I have adapted a large part of the code base to use ImageDescriptors whenever possible and only create Images when needed. The class who is creating the image is then also responsible for disposing it, once no longer needed.
This shift of responsiblity should make it much less likely for errors like this to show up and also make it much easier to resolve.
There are still some sections where we still use images, but as far as I can tell, they are disposed properly. So it's not an immediate issue to change those parts as well.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5kYRve/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

But in the preview, everything is there. Because there's no menu, there's no handle and thus, a NullPointerException.

A search led me to [Bug 570994](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=570994), which seems to describe exactly the same behavior. And from what I understand, this is not an Eclipse issue, but rather some weird configuration on my system that's causing those artifacts.

Do we have any GTK experts who might have an idea what's going on here?

As a test, I simply copied the code from the MacOS class, and it works pretty much perfectly.

Two other things I noticed:
The reason the ToolBarManager is drawn outside the rectangle is most likely caused by the missing shell. The figure takes the height of the title into consideration, while the widget doesn't. I've enabled it and the problem disappeared.

Furthermore, the reason the MenuManager isn't drawn might be related to the order, in which the widgets are created. I've attached the default implementation when creating a JFace application with the toolbar manager.
If I replace

```
public Test() {
	super(null);
	createActions();
	addToolBar(SWT.FLAT | SWT.WRAP);
	addMenuBar();
	addStatusLine();
}
```

with

```
public Test() {
	super(null);
	createActions();
	addMenuBar();
	addToolBar(SWT.FLAT | SWT.WRAP);
	addStatusLine();
}
```
the menu manager is correctly drawn.

The fragment host of `org.eclipse.wb.jdt.fragment` is `org.eclipse.jdt.core` on which `org.eclipse.wb.dev` depends. So in order to build `org.eclipse.wb.dev`, `org.eclipse.wb.jdt.fragment` has to build first.

I don't see project build cycles, but many projects with a nested _requires-to-build-first_ structure, e.g.
* org.eclipse.wb.tests
  * org.eclipse.wb.rcp.databinding.xwt
    * org.eclipse.wb.rcp.databinding
      * org.eclipse.wb.rcp
        * org.eclipse.wb.core.java
          * (via org.eclipse.jdt.core) org.eclipse.wb.jdt.fragment 

or
* org.eclipse.wb.tests
  * org.eclipse.wb.rcp.databinding.xwt
    * org.eclipse.wb.xwt
      * org.eclipse.wb.rcp
        * org.eclipse.wb.swt
          * (via org.eclipse.jdt.core) org.eclipse.wb.jdt.fragment

Does in the preferences _General > Workspace > Build_ increasing _Max iterations when building with cycles_ help?

I bet @mickaelistria could tell us how to trace the iterations of the project builders.

I installed windowbuilder but it is not working. When running Im getting errors such as ""Eventqueue cannot be resolved"". And when opening the Designer window (below). I have been ableto use WB on previous Eclipse versions without any issues.

I tried re-installing both Eclipse and the plug-in with no luck. Any help would be highly appreciated?

Unknown GUI toolkit

The parser parsed the compilation unit, but can't identifyany GUI toolkit, so WindowBuilder can't display any GUI to edit. This can be caused by one of thefollowing reasons: 
•This class is not an editable UI class and contains no UI components.
•WindowBuilder does not recognize the GUI toolkit or library used in this class.
•WindowBuilder does not understand this GUI type/pattern in a supported GUI toolkit.
•Problems exist with the classpath. For example, the compilation unit uses SWT classes, but theSWT/JFace libraries are not included into the classpath.

I installed a different Eclipse version which is from 2018 and it worked for me, I don't understand why this happens, it even worked for me with the latest JRE version 1.8 Installed. I don't know how I could have solved this with the version I posted you at the beginning and with the one that gives me that error of not being able to add components.

So, I suspect that the problem could be on referenced Libraries which use SWT.

<sup>Originally posted by **tobieche110** October 25, 2022</sup>
Hi! So, I recently installed this plugin. I can't manage to get it to work. I can access the Design tab when I create an Application Window class, but if I try to do anything (inserting a button in the window, redimensioning it, anything) I get this error:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15698861/197889993-cf97727f-2a59-4084-89d0-f4fc0904b1e2.png)
(This particularly happens when I try to redimension it)

I've googled the issue a lot and I can't find any solution. At fist I thought it was an error from this specific project, but it happens even on fresh new projects without any other class.

When I try to run the program, the default window opens, and it seems to work, but I still get this problem.

Please help me.

I am trying to figure out a way to ""force"" DesignComposite composite to always use the Light theme (or better yet, the system theme) regardless to the Eclipse theme selection because the SWT ""dark-mode"" color defaults in the GEF canvas of WB are never correct in regards to how the SWT UI looks when build for production (using system theme).
Many times the SWT ""dark-mode"" color defaults in the GEF canvas of WB become so confusing that I result in setting widget colors statically and once I'm done with the SWT Composite design I remove the static colors one by one.

I tried to find a way to do this by poking around in the _org.eclipse.wb.internal.core.editor_.DesignComposite.java class,  but I cannot seem to find a way to ""forcibly"" set the widget colors defaults to Light or System theme defaults of the GEF canvas.

Do you know if this is actually possible?
If yes, the can you point to me which classes in the WB plugin sources should I be looking so that I can figure out some sort of a solution?

However, it seems RCPTT is unable to pick up the GEF edit-parts. 

Let's consider the following example:

If I click on the palette or the properties, nothing is recorded by RCPTT. Drag & Drop to the content pane is also ignored. The only thing that is detected are interactions with the components tree, given that this is an SWT component.

If I double-click on the pallete, following entry is recorded:

```
with [get-editor ""JavaFrame.java"" | get-canvas -index 4] {
    double-click
}
```

I can also double-click on other components, but the only thing changing here is the index. So it seems like RCPTT is able to detect the root part, but not the elements that are contained by it.

Our application also contains graphical editor, where we use GEF directly. Which we _are_ able to test via RCPTT. My suspicion is that something in the GEF/Draw2D fork, used by the WindowBuilder doesn't play nice with this tool.

Normally, when you click on a GEF edit-part, RCPTT records something along the line of:
```
with [get-editor ""JavaFrame.java"" | get-diagram | get-edit-part -className ScrolledCompositeEditPart] {
    ....
}
```

The way this works is that if you click on a canvas, RCPTT checks whether this canvas is of type FigureCanvas. The same is true for the edit-parts. If this is the case, then those special `get-diagram` and `get-edit-part` statements are created.

Those classes also exist for the WindowBuilder. However, RCPTT expects them to be in the `org.eclipse.gef` package, but the classes it finds are in `org.eclipse.wb.gef` and therefore incompatible.

As far as I can tell, this leaves three options:
- Migrate WindowBuilder to the latest GEF-classic release
- Extend RCPTT to support the GEF fork used by WindowBuilder
- Accept that WindowBuilder can't be tested via RCPTT

Given that both the first and second option are far from trivial, my concern is that the third option is the most feasible one.

It's a little bit more compilcated than that. RCPTT has a set of [dedicated](https://github.com/eclipse/org.eclipse.rcptt/tree/master/runtime/tesla/org.eclipse.rcptt.tesla.recording.gef) GEF plugins. First it checks via an `instanceof`, whether the object is of the correct type and then it retrieves the internal state, either via getter methods or via reflection.

Which means even if it receives a WB FigureCanvas, we wouldn't get very far because e.g. the private fields don't match. But it might be possible to generalize this via the Eclipse [adapters](https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Adapters/index.html). So instead of doing the `instanceof` check, RCPTT calls `Adapters.adapt(object, FigureCanvas.class)`.

Because the object already has the correct type for GEF figures, it should remain compatible with the previous implementation. The only thing left is for either us or WB to define translation rules to convert the WB figures into GEF figures. Though I can't predict how difficult such a conversion would be.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5X9wsP/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

- temporarily disable the failing test cases
- adapt the existing pull-request to also reactivate the tests they repair

I suggest you create a PR with all test fixes you have so far and we merge it. One or multiple PR with multiple commits are fine for me. I would see if the test result upload shows less test failures and if merge them.

Can you also try to just execute the AbsoluteLayoutSelectionActionsTest (the SWT one, not the Swing one)? That one should be enough to reliably reproduce the SIGSEGV. So you don't have to always execute the entire test suite.

While I had 5 screen-resolution-specific test failures, the entire build finished.

In short, the problem seems to stem from taking a screenshot widgets which are only partially visible. Meaning the current solution is to crop the screenshot to ignore the unmapped area.
One example being the AbsoluteLayoutSelectionActionsTest, which used to consistently crash on Wayland.

I've moved a lot of the screenshot-logic from C to Java. So if a similar problem happens in the future, we hopefully have an easier time debugging this problem. I've also switched to taking the screenshot via SWT, rather than calling the Cairo methods directly. Reason being that they certainly have more experience dealing with GTK/GDK than I do.

As a side note: Even though the tests should finish, this doesn't mean the SWT editor is usable on Wayland. There is a general problem on Wayland, where any screenshot is just white. The same problem also happens with a pure SWT application and existed prior to this change.

I would suggest moving everything to the standard Eclipse formatter (I did
this in the past for some code) and use the cleanup batch operations to
re-format the remaining code. That is what we also did in platform a while
ago.

Git can ignore whitespace changes, so we should be fine to still see the
commit history.

Best regards, Lars

Given that most browsers dropped their support for Java plugins, we should remove the corresponding code from WB.

See [JEP 398](https://openjdk.org/jeps/398) for reference.

From the original Oracle whitepaper:

> With modern browser vendors working to restrict or reduce the support of plugins like Flash, Silverlight and Java in their products, developers of applications that rely on the Java browser plugin need to consider alternative options. Java developers currently relying on browser plugins should consider migrating from Java Applets to the plugin-free Java Web Start technology.
>
> Supporting Java in browsers is only possible for as long as browser vendors are committed to supporting standards based plugins. By late 2015, many browser vendors had either removed or announced timelines for the removal of standards based plugin support, while some are introducing proprietary browser-specific extension APIs. Consequently, Oracle is planning to deprecate the Java browser plugin in JDK 9.
>
> The deprecated plugin technology will be completely removed from the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in a future Java release TBD. Java Web Start applications do not rely on a browser plugin and will not be affected by these changes.

In principle, there should be no hard limit on how big the frame can be.

This project is run by volunteers and this issue is currently not very high on my bucket list. So if this is an urgent problem, I think your best chance is if you're able to submit a patch for it. I will find the time to review it and get it merged into the master.

That being said, I think the issue lies somewhere within the GraphicalViewer, or more generally with our GEF fork. So this is the first point where I'd start looking.

It might also be that this issue is going to be resolved together with #186.

The way WindowBuilder creates the preview is by constructing a JFrame instance and then taking a screenshot. So the relevant classes are the `setBounds()` in the JFrame, JFrameInfo and the Figure class.

It think it would be interesting to see whether this value is updated correctly, after the JFrame has been resized.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5bP1n6/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Take this class for example:
```
public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		JFrame frame = new JFrame();
		frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		frame.setBounds(100, 100, 10000, 10000);
		frame.setVisible(true);
	}
}
```

If you run this class (without WindowBuilder, just as a normal Java application), then the frame will be maximized and take up your entire screen (which most likely has a smaller resolution than 10000x10000). So to answer your initial question:
The maximum width and height of a JFrame is defined by (java.awt.)Toolkit.getScreenSize().

Which means there is little that can be fixed on our site. The documentation should probably be updated, to include this limitation and the preview in the design page should also be limited to that size.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5fnj5I/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The lower bound is exactly the issue. WindowBuilder requiires ASM 9.5, but the Eclipse 4.27 is using ASM 9.4. But in principle, any 9.x version should be compatible.

It seems a significant problem that WindowBuilder doesn't produce stable milestone builds.   Hence you talk about creating a release, but the normal process is to produce stable milestone builds that are contributed to SimRel regularly on schedule.   Eventually release candidate builds are produced (late this month) and when all looks good, you produce a release synchronized with the SimRel.

This is why I helped Mylyn set up such a repo structure which is automatically maintained by the builds:

One can never assume anyone else does only reasonable things.  😞

So the missing things have simply been overlooked...

What I would like to prototype is creating a new **separate** feature that includes all the 3rd party libraries.  That feature will be included in the category.xml so that the 3rd party libraries are included in the site, but no actual user-installed feature includes specific versions and the bundles allow version ranges such that newer versions of these 3rd party could be installed yet some actual version is always available so that WB can be installed all by itself...

I'm pretty much done here...

With a bit of trickery, I mirrored the 1.11.0 release into the new structure

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/208716/ae401615-ffe0-4341-a6ec-9b723ace4750)

So https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/latest/ already composes https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/release/latest and https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/lastgoodbuild/ composes https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/nightly/latest as discussed.

The latest milestone https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/milestone/latest is a 1.12 build:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/208716/7b1da1d4-07da-4b97-86c4-e963875bdbfa)

I've updated the download page accordingly:

https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/download.php

It would be nice if in the future we don't actually need to update the download page each release given the sites are self-documenting...

One of your marketplace listings https://www.eclipse.org/setups/marketplace/?id=4961416 was broken:

It really is... Even though their GitHub page is still somewhat maintained, the last issue was fixed back in 2020. In any case, that's not a can of worms I want to open so soon after the ByteBuddy migration.

https://github.com/apache/commons-digester

Given that the dependency to CGLib was introduced with Digester 3.2, my current idea is to build WB against the 3.1. Without an upper bound in the Manifest files, users are free to install a newer version, if they want. But then _they_ have to contribute the CGLib bundle.

Which then leads to the next problem, which is that EasyMock _also_ has a dependency on CGLib. So I have to see whether we can update the embedded jar to a newer version or switch to Mockito there as well.

This warning is thrown whenever one of our tests is calling getImageSurface() in native code (i.e. the `rcp.c`). The fact that it is shown over and over again seems to indicate that the tests are still running, it's just not shown in the log.

As a dirty workaround, could you try to increase the timeout in the `org.eclipse.wb.tests/pom.xml` file? It's currently set to 1h. If it's just the tests taking a long time, perhaps we can increase it a little until we figure out what's wrong.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5dqhvN/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The Jenkins build itself also has a timeout of 50min. So it might really be a combination of slow tests + slow signing that's causing problems.

This would mean that even with an increased timeout, the build is likely to still fail because of it. Who here has the permissions to edit this job?

Hm... So there really is something slowing down the tests every now and then.
In general, we should probably increase the timeout on the Jenkins job, given how tight the limit seems to be.

The past few days have been a little busy, so I had little time to work on the WindowBuilder. :sweat_smile: 
I still have a few pull requests open, but as you mentioned a few days ago: Given that they affect sensitive areas, I think it's it's better to hold them off so soon before the release.

That said, I think we haven't updated the versions in the Manifest files since the previous release, even though all have been changed since them, due to the Java 17 update, for example. I've played around with the tycho-baseline-plugin to see what the suggested new versions are, and a lot of them would require a major version increase, due to e.g. the removal of CGLib and the GEF migration.

As far as I can tell, Tycho internally calls the bnd-baseline-plugin, which supports the exclusion of specific packages. The documentation even contains a similar example:

> For example, you want to match all implementation packages (i.e. they have impl in their name) except when they start with com.example. This can be achieved with:
>!com.example.*impl*, *.impl.*

But I think I just have to take some time and see how this works, exactly. In any case, for the next build, I think it's the most effective if I increase the micro version of all bundles, without using any baseline check.

The Jenkins job is set to 1.5h. But the tests themselves also have a 60min timeout, in order to not block the GitHub builds. The tests finished yesterday within 35min, which is what they usually take. 
And I don't really want to arbitrarily increase the timeout without understanding the underlying problem.

I have a frame with label, jtextfield, and 2 buttons when you run the program the label and the textfield show but the butttons dont until you mouse over them.

I don't think that's necessarily a WindowBuilder bug but just how Swing behaves. The primary issues seems to be that you call `frame.setVisible(true)`, _before_ adding the buttons. Because you also don't use a layout, there is no incentive for Swing to redraw the button area. That is until you hover over them.

In short, there are two ways to fix this:
- Call `frame.setVisible(true);` at the _end_ of the method, once everything has been added.
- Use something like GridLayout, FlowLayout.

The latter one is the more elegant and also more stable solution.

That's sadly not something I could reproduce with the code snippet you provided. Which version of WindowBuilder are you using? Almost any newer version should require at least Java 11, so I find it odd that you mention Java 8.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5c2Q3E/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Meaning an additional 33min was spent just on loading the target platform and compiling the code. Running the job locally, I'm pretty sure the release update site is the main problem. I think that also explains why those builds sporadically run into a timeout.

> The difficult method is going to be the `decorateImage()` method, which we use to quickly construct composite images. JFace doesn't provide a function for such a specific use-case.

JFace also offers `org.eclipse.jface.viewers.DecorationOverlayIcon`, which seems to be capable of the same like `decorateImage()`. Since it is a ImageDescriptor it also works well with JFace' ResourceManager and one is not forced to really create the images immediately.
See for example https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.ui/pull/842.

Furthermore I wonder why there is a split of a custom `ResourceManager` and `SwtResourceManager`? To me it even looks like they share a lot of code.

Though I fear the descriptors create another problem:
Quite often, WindowBuilder is using the images directly, which also often leads to memory leaks like in #260. Meaning before we can think about deprecating the SwtResourceManager, we first have adapt all (relevant) methods to use ImageDescriptors instead.

There are a couple of head-scratchers in this project. And while I can't say for certain why it was done like this, my best guess is ""convenience"". Instead of having to learn the JFace API, it's quicker to just re-implement the class with methods suited for this project.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5fdabJ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

They are not only in this project. 😄
In general, since the code generated by this WindowBuilder is used and also read by many developers I think it would be good to use the latest and best practices in order to be a good role model for them and show them how to do things best.

Btw. using the `ResourceManager `hopefully becomes a bit simpler with changes like https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.ui/pull/838.

There are several locations where WindowBuilder:

a) Makes several case-distinctions between the old and new Observable API
b) Creates a bi-directional mapping between methods of the new API to the old API

Keeping the former is a real pain in terms of maintainability. Latter falls apart because both versions are not 100% compatible.
Example: `SWTObservables.observeSelection()` can be any of `WidgetProperties.widgetSelection()`, `WidgetProperties.dateTimeSelection()`, ...
And this problem will only increase, the more features are added to the new API.

Almost 20 years ago, we delivered a project which included Swing screens using a set of custom components.
When used in their current environment (Windows Server 2003 x86, JDK 1.7.0_90, Eclipse 3.3.1.1 and WindowBuilder Pro 6.4.1 (2007/08/13)), these design just fine.
However, they are trying to update their environments and go over to 64-bit, which means they also have to upgrade to a current WindowBuilder. This is causing design time problems for large screens. If we ""downgrade"" the screens to use plain Swing controls, the problem goes away, so it is likely a compatibility issue situated in our own components.

Is there a migration guide that describes things that need to be done differently in order to work with WindowBuilder compared to the ancient Pro version? 

# Issue Description

In WindowBuilder Pro, they have

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/13708975/eb969945-5635-46b9-89b6-62b484424a5e)

The screen is 90 lines high, so 1530 pixels (component/line height is fixed at 17 pixels).
The screen's vertical resolution is 1080 pixels.
All items are visible.


The same screen in the current environment (Windows Server 2019 x64, OpenJDK 17.0.6, Eclipse 2023-03 (4.27.0) and WindowBuilder 1.12.0) is not shown completely:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/13708975/e939323e-fa6d-486d-99a2-e203acb795cd)

Same size and resolution.
The first partially visible item is at 1055 pixels.
Given that the component height is fixed at 17 pixels, its lower edge should be at 1072 pixels.

If they reduce the vertical resolution to 1024, then the visibility is commensurately reduced:

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/13708975/6b1c4187-db5a-40b2-b128-8898999ebadd)

Note that they claim they already investigated the free WindowBuilder over a decade ago, and saw the same problem at that time, which is mainly why they did not switch. The x86->x64 push is now forcing their hand.

If there is no migration guide, and none of this rings a bell as a known issue, I can attach the source of the screen in question along with our component jar for further investigation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/498/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am trying to run through this tutorial for class for installing software plug-ins in Eclipse. 
The video states these steps.

- File, New, Other, Window builder, application window.
- I hit next, Source folder is already there as ""HelloWorld/src"" (Created from a previous tutorial on printing ""Hello World"")
- In the name box I type ""HelloWorldClass"" and click finish

At this point, I see the code it generates but when I click on the ""Design"" tab it gives me an error.

In short: It seems like the _com.google.guava_ plugin isn't available in your Eclipse installation.

Generally I'd suggest installing the latest release. The required plugins should automatically be installed as part of the update:
https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/release/latest/

Alternatively, it may also work if you manually install Guava from e.g. the Eclipse Orbit update site:
https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20230531010532/repository

As a side-note:
XWT doesn't work properly with the Eclipse 4.26 an onwards due to the removal of the deprecated Observable API and planned for removal in a future WindowBuilder version.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5hAOQR/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thank you for your reply, I deleted the files I had downloaded for the version of window builder I was using, I got the link from a video in school that's about 6 years old. I downloaded and installed the new version and also downloaded Guava from the link you provided but I still get an error show below.

WindowBuilder encountered unexpected internal error.

This could be caused by a WindowBuilder bug or by a misconfiguration issue, conflict, partial update, etc.

org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Plug-in ""org.eclipse.wb.xwt"" was unable to instantiate class ""org.eclipse.wb.internal.xwt.gef.EditPartFactory"".

I had a look at the 1.7.x update site and I get the feeling the Manifest file for the XWT plugin is broken. But how were we then able to create a release?...

In any case, I think there is a dependency problem within the 1.7.x WindowBuilder release, which is why the XWT feature doesn't work. XWT is also no longer part of the 1.12 release, which is why you still carry the old plugins in your Eclipse installation, even after the update.

I suggest the following:
Remove the WindowBuilder feature/plugins from your Eclipse installation and install the previous 1.11 release:
https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/release/1.11.0
That is the last release that still supports XWT.

If you just want to create a new application window, it might not even be necessary to install XWT support. As an alternative, it may also be sufficient if you simply do a clean install of WindowBuilder, but this time, without XWT.

If the problem still shows up afterwards, if would be great if you could also upload the Java file that's causing the crash.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5hMuk9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thank you, I will try that. I also deleted Eclipse entirely and realized I installed the x86_64 version instead of the AArch64 version. Not sure if that played a role but I will now install that version of WindowBuilder and give it a go.

Sorry yes it still does a full build but ignores the result artifacts completely.  A bit less than perfect but easier not to try to make the whole regular build be skipped for the 4 times per year that you could save that build time.

This doesn't only affect the initial creation, but also any modifications done to the screen.

According to VisualVM, the problem is located in the SwingScreenshotMaker, during the conversion from a BufferedImage to an SWT Image.

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/70652978/f113721d-f14c-47ef-b167-0f8f80bc7151)

Corresponding Code Snippet:

```
public static Image convertImage_AWT_to_SWT(final java.awt.Image image) throws Exception {
        return SwingUtils.runObjectLaterAndWait(new RunnableObjectEx<Image>() {
	        public Image runObject() throws Exception {
		        BufferedImage bufferedImage = (BufferedImage) image;
		        int imageWidth = bufferedImage.getWidth();
		        int imageHeight = bufferedImage.getHeight();
		        Image swtImage = new Image(null, imageWidth, imageHeight);
		        final ImageData swtImageData = swtImage.getImageData();
		        try {
			        ImageProducer source = image.getSource();
			        source.startProduction(new AwtToSwtImageConverter(bufferedImage, swtImageData));
			        return new Image(null, swtImageData);
		        } catch (Throwable e) {
			        // fallback to ImageIO.
			        return ImageUtils.convertToSWT(image);
		        } finally {
			        swtImage.dispose();
		        }
	        }
        });
}
```

The problematic lines are `Image swtImage = new Image(null, imageWidth, imageHeight);` and `final ImageData swtImageData = swtImage.getImageData();`.
Effectively, this just creates a blank ImageData object with given width and height. So we might get away by simply creating the ImageData object directly, instead of going via the Image. 

Swing Screen:

```
public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		JFrame frame = new JFrame();
		frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		frame.setBounds(100, 100, 10000, 10000);
		frame.setVisible(true);
	}
}
```

I assume a similar problem exists for smaller, but more complex screens.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/506/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

From this error I deduced that mvel  was missing on the classpath. So I searched for this library and found it:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mvel/mvel2/2.5.0.Final

I added it to the module classpath of my RCP (I have a bundled JDK) and the error was finally gone.

Could it be possible that this is a general missing WindowBuilder library?

The new bundle should be part of the WindowBuilder installation, so normally, it shouldn't be necessary to explicitly add it to the classpath.

Thank you a lot.

The exception seems to be thrown by MVEL while trying to load a certain ""ASMAccessorImpl_\<random-integer\>"", which  seems like an internal class created by MVEL itself. Furthermore, it's a lot harder to trigger this exception while debugging, so I'm suspecting timing and classloader loading/unloading within MVEL to be the primary factor.

A quick search lead me to https://github.com/mvel/mvel/issues/194, which seems to describe exactly what you're experiencing. Sadly, without any result. I find it weird that the problem no longer showed up after you added MVEL to the classpath, but that might've simply tweaked the timing in a favorable behavior.

The issue was reported with MVEL 2.4.3. Over the next few days, I'll try to see if it also shows up with an older versions. Alternatively, I can also try to synchronize calls to MVEL. But right now, I know too little about this library to say for certain what's causing this :(","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5jcpZU/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It seems like my initial guess was wrong. MVEL internally loads an instance of Accessor using a different classloader than what's used to call it. This classloader is based on the project classloader and thus doesn't have MVEL in its classpath, hence the exception.
Which means your initial guess was correct and also the reason why manually adding it to the classpath resolves the problem.
The problematic part of the code is only called occasionally, for reasons that I simply don't know. Which is also why I can't simplify your example any further and create an integration test for it. :/
In any case, the solution is the same as yours: To make sure MVEL is part of the project classloader.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5jwJp5/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thank you for your response.  I hope the information provided below is helpful.

I have two versions of Eclipse currently installed on my desktop PC (Neon and 2023-06) which is running Windows 10 Enterprise.  I was using Neon until last fall when I decided to upgrade to 2023-06 but kept Neon just incase I had issues with the new install.

Neon does not have any issues with GridBagLayout.  I can add and delete components and navigate thru the Structure gaining focus on the components without any issues.

I have the following issues with 2023-06
-throws exceptions when adding components to GridBagLayout or when trying to rename a component
***@***.***
This happened on a brand new project with only one or two components on a GridBagLayout panel.
***@***.***
-Component does not allow Copy, Paste or Delete once added to the panel.
***@***.***
-Row Delete Contents causes error
***@***.***
-when selecting a component in the Design tab Structure does not select the component in the panel. lblPosted is selected in the Structure but not in the view.
***@***.***
-I also get errors like this when switching between open projects that have a GridBagLayout
***@***.***


If you need any additional information please let me know.

I don't know if it is a bug or version compatibility issue or designer setup but hopefully this will lead you closer to a solution.

Thank you.

The patch you created appears to prevent the hard errors.

The issue still remains in GridBagLayout I cannot delete any components that have been added.

It will not stop development because I can edit directly in the source but I sure would be nice to have that functionality back.

I downloaded but could not install the JDK you listed.

I am getting ""Version 1.8.0_144 of the JVM is not suitable for this product.  Version 17 or greater is required.""

I don't know my next step.  I may want to install on a different PC so I don't corrupt my current system.

I will be in touch.

You can also install the Eclipse SDK via the installer. This should then automatically install the required JDK as well:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer

Just scroll down until you get to the SDK entry and the installer should do the rest.

Then I installed Eclipse IDE and JDK 1.8 and JKD 17 because I need to build with 1.8.0
Changed my eclipse.ini file

Now my Eclipse opens but when I try to Open With WindowBuilder Editor I do not get a Design tab.

I am getting very frustrated and am ready to just go back to Neon.

Is there any help that you can offer?

I downloaded but could not install the JDK you listed. I am getting ""Version 1.8.0_144 of the JVM is not suitable for this product. Version 17 or greater is required.""

You can also install the Eclipse SDK via the installer. This should then automatically install the required JDK as well:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer

Just scroll down until you get to the SDK entry and the installer should do the rest.

I think it's just not possible anymore to run recent versions WindowBuilder with Java 8, meaning you need to migrate to a newer Java version, if you want to use it.

If you _need_ to run the code with Java 8, then you could instead set the compiler compliance of your Eclipse project to 1.8. The resulting code should then still be executable with Java 8, even though it was compiled with a newer version.

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK)
Must be available in order to run Eclipse..... so I installed the JDK 17.

But that was just to launch Eclipse.

According to what you said all of the newer versions of Eclipse cannot be used to build over Java 8 so I guess we are stuck with reverting back to Neon.

I appreciate your response.  Just wish we would have know that earlier or I would have never upgraded.

We are going to be going thru some process changes here so hopefully we will get away from Java 8.  Unfortunately I don't think that will be nearly soon enough.

Thanks again for your prompt feedback.

I have used this procedure for eclipse Java IDE with WindowBuilder, but it's failing since eclipse 2023-06 with WindowBuilder 12. Actually, it does behave as usual with eclipse JEE 2023-06!

I'm using both W10 and Linux Ubuntu 22.04, properly updated. Neither the OS nor the JDK version (adoptium) seem to make any difference.

The procedure:
- Unzip/untar eclipse.
- Create dir dropins/WindowBuilder and unzip WindowBuilder-Updates-1.12.0.zip
- Remove p2 root files in dropins/WindowBuilder
- Start eclipse (removed .eclipse and .p2 for testing purposes)
- Check for WB icon / Check with New XXX wizards for WindowBuilder
- Maybe restart eclipse and retry: makes no difference

As I said:
- Java IDE 2023-03 + WB 11: OK
- Java IDE 2023-06 + WB 12: fail
- JEE IDE 2023-06 + WB 12: OK

Last week I also tried with Java IDE 2023-09 M2, with no luck.

I have copied config listings before and after populating the dropins folder in both cases. I may keep using eclipse JEE, but I hope this may help.

If you remove everything but the features and plugins folder, the dropin mechanism seems to work again. So I think that problem is not exclusive to WindowBuilder.

Well, this one was with the 4.28, not the 4.29 M1. But I think I see what the problem is. Can you check something for me? Is `org.apache.commons.collections` installed in the JEE IDE? What about the normal IDE? 

What happens when you download `org.apache.commons.collections` from [Eclipse Orbit](https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20230531010532/) and also add it to the dropins folder?

In short: The MVEL version distributed with current release (2.4.15) is not compatible with Java 21. So your options are to:
- Stay with Java 17 until the winter release
- Manually download and install MVEL 2.5.0
- Use the 1.14.0 M1: https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/milestone/S20231002053

> That class is marked for removal in Java 17. Which JDK are you using?

Only with the upcoming 1.14.0. The current release is still using the incompatible version.

What's the process with which you install WindowBuilder?

The normal workflow should be:

-> Help -> Install New Software...
-> Enter https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/release/1.13.0
-> Select all WindowBuilder features

![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/70652978/b1f0ca1f-7812-4921-935c-fde3a3fbbd3f)

If that doesn't work, I'd consider cleanup up/disabling some of the p2 software sites. Perhaps a bad URL snuck its way in and is now causing problems.

As a last option, I would suggest installing WindowBuilder in a fresh Eclipse environment.

Just for clarification, you're talking about the LAF that's shown in the Design page, right? And from what it sounds like you're using Swing?

You should be able to add your own LookAndFeels.

One caveat is that we no longer attempt to capture the window decorations, as they are not part of the shell itself. With X11, this is partially possible but not on Wayland, given the sever limitations when it comes to screen captures.

I have a Window Builder program (“WordleSolver”) that works when I run it within eclipse Version: 2023-09 (4.29.0) Build id: 20230907-1323. I believe that the project was originally created in a previous release.

I exported the program as a Runnable Jar.

THE PROBLEM:
Double-clicking on the runnable jar results in a Java Virtual Machine Launcher error dialog saying “A Java Exception has occurred”. I haven’t been able to figure out what the exception is or where it occurred.

NOTES:

The jar works fine when executed from the command line with “java -jar WordleSolver.jar”.
Command line Java version:
C:\Temp>java -version
java version ""16"" 2021-03-16
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 16+36-2231)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16+36-2231, mixed mode, sharing)

When I exported it as a runnable jar, it gave me the seemingly ever-present “finished with warnings” message. Below  is the message with a summary of the details:
===========
JAR export finished with warnings. See details for additional information.
  Exported with compile warnings: WordleSolver/src/pkgWordleSolver/WordleSolverMain.java

The Build Path for the project is in the following screenshot.
Any ideas would be welcome.

From what I can tell, the jar itself is valid, if you are able to launch it from the command line. My best guess is that the JDK that is used when double-clicking isn't the one that is used in the command line. That said, I fail to see how this is then related to WindowBuilder, given that the problem would show up on _any_ exported jar.

I would expect that to be normal. In the end, you create a runnable jar containing all required Eclipse dependencies. Meaning all bundles like e.g. JFace and SWT are merged into a single archive. If some of those bundles contain the same file (e.g. plugin.xml, license text), it's only natural that they overwrite each other.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5qVjW4/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As seen here, this is not the correct version.
To fix this, you need to do a clean re-installation of WindowBuilder.

1) In your menu bar, click on Help -> About Eclipse -> Installation Details
2) In the Installed Software tab, search for all WindowBuilder components and uninstall them
3) Reinstall WindowBuilder from the marketplace

Can you provide a screenshot of your ""Installed Software"" tab?

Because that was the configuration where the error you described showed up.

After I manually deinstalled the SWT Designer XWT Support and XML Core, the problem was gone. Meaning I still believe that one of the plugins was not properly removed in your Eclipse installation.

The behavior I'm experiencing is adding a JTable to anything is not possible with the designer (while something like JTree will work), and if I add a simple JTable in the code, the designer view will go blank.

Here is how little code it takes for me to reproduce this issue:

    private JFrame frame;

    /**
     * Create the application.
     */
    public TestView() {
        initialize();
    }

     * Initialize the contents of the frame.
     */
    private void initialize() {
        frame = new JFrame();
        frame.setBounds(100, 100, 450, 300);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        
        JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
        //final JTable table = new JTable();
        //scrollPane.setViewportView(table);
        GroupLayout groupLayout = new GroupLayout(frame.getContentPane());
        groupLayout.setHorizontalGroup(
            groupLayout.createParallelGroup(Alignment.LEADING)
                .addGroup(groupLayout.createSequentialGroup()
                    .addContainerGap()
                    .addComponent(scrollPane, GroupLayout.DEFAULT_SIZE, 438, Short.MAX_VALUE)
                    .addContainerGap())
        );

You can check the execution environment by right-clicking on the project and then go Properties -> Java Build Path -> Right Click on the JRE System Library -> Edit

But I don't think that's necessary. The error log already tells me what the problem is:

There was quite a lot of work done with the GEF migration, but ideally that's now something that will be visible to the user. If you're experiencing anything odd in the design page, please let me know. Otherwise it should (hopefully) behave exactly the same.

This seems to be a [common](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41560368/screenshot-comes-out-black-on-wayland) problem not only we, but also the SWT team seems to be affected by.

The most concise explanation I could find boils down to:
> By design, Wayland is a lot more secure than X11 and does not allow one application to capture the content of other applications

Or in short: Screen capture is not a valid use case.

Gnome seems to support using dbus API and some internal endpoints but that just reeks of bad code. Moreover, it would also mean that we have to implement this workaround for every window manager, which I don't see as a feasible solution...

Has anyone ever worked with Wayland or had to handle with this kind of problem? Suggestions would help out a lot!

This is exactly what I mean. If you right-click on your project and then go Properties -> Java Build Path -> Select JRE System Library -> Click Edit, you can select the execution environment for your project.

In the screenshot, I've set it to Java 8, even though I'm using Java 17. The generated byte code is still compatible with Java 8 and the compiler would even warn you, if you attempt to use any newer language features. There are a few caveats of course, but I don't think they should have a significant impact for WindowBuilder.

Also from an UX perspective, why should unchecked elements show up in the combo box, if the user isn't allowed to select them?

This issue was introduced back with 280f8aa3282dce10f92e7d2cbe7077071aa11836.

The issue was already brought up in the simrel-build repository when the XWT components were disabled from aggregation.

But this is not the topic of this issue. With the 2023-12 release, the Eclipse Platform moves from the javax.* to jakarta.* namespace, with the plan to drop the support of the former, at some point in the future. Unsurprisingly, XWT is still using the javax packages, which is already causing problems when trying to setup the WindowBuilder workspace.

Given that both [this](https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/xwt/org.eclipse.xwt/+/205432) and [this](https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/xwt/org.eclipse.xwt/+/205609) item haven't been addressed yet, I don't have high expectation that this gets resolved anytime soon...

My position still hasn't changed where I'm willing to support XWT, as long as it doesn't require a significant amount of work. But given the direction their project is going, it might be worth to reconsider...

I think its something to do with the CardLayout since the design tab works again when i delete these:

    ```
contentPane.add(cardPanel, ""mainPanel"");
    contentPane.add(adminPanel, ""adminPanel"");  
    contentPane.add(aSingleQuesPanel, ""aSingleQuesPanel"");
    contentPane.add(aMultiQuesPanel, ""aMultiQuesPanel"");
    contentPane.add(removeQuestionPanel, ""removeQuestionPanel"");
    contentPane.add(startGame, ""startGame"");
    contentPane.add(highScore, ""highScore"");
```

Do you simply open the design page or are there any other steps I have to do, in order to reproduce the exception?
Granted, your example is incomplete, so I had to replace the missing classes with plain JPanels.

Appreciate the help!

This is most likely the problem. I would suggest you use at least Java 17.
You can download a matching JDK from here: https://adoptium.net/

Note that Java 21 is also possible, but only with the latest WindowBuilder release.
If you still need to compile your project with Java 8, you can then simply set the execution environment to 1.8 in the project properties.

I have just updated to Java 19 and noticed that I was on Java 17 before, but still didn't solve the problem. I managed to access the design of the mainframe by clicking on the two small arrows on the top right of the cardPanel. Its weird because the program runs perfect, only problem is the execution errors im getting.

The buttons just switch between the different cards. If if fails for some but not for all, then this seems to indicate that there is an issue with one of the panels.

Can you perhaps flip through all panels and check for which it works and for which it doesn't?

Can you perhaps also zip and upload the whole project? There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the MainFrame class on its own, so I have a hard time analyzing the problem with just that...","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5vV8_Q/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As some final words: The error `Exception during creation of: guiPanels.AdminPanel` is caused while trying to instantiate the MainFrame. Meaning WindowBuilder found something in your code it doesn't like. Given that I don't have access to the code, I can only speculate as to why that might be.

I suppose evaluation  {<null>} is caused because at the moment of displaying of layout in Design it `new` may be treated as a null, but even when I make a field:
`CustomTableModel someVal = new CustomTableModel();`
and pass it, it is still evaluated as a null.

When I run app everything is displayed properly.

Can you provide a minimal project that reproduces this problem?
What Java version are you using?
What WindowBuilder version are you using?

> Is it possible to set some flag like 'lazy verification""? I mean quiet often I set a field but initialize it in constructor. It seems WindowsBuilder by default treat it like some kind of problem. Or maybe I understand this mechanism wrong?

That shouldn't really be necessary. Internally, WindowBuilder creates stubs of all the classes that are used. Meaning that an error like this seems to indicate that something is going wrong somewhere.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5vu0Er/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Maybe this is a feature of WB?
I am pretty sure it is connected with the class field:
`private Competition competition;`
and trial of usage it later in the application:
```
		@Override
		public int getRowCount()
		{
			var size = 0;
			//if (competition != null)
			//{
				size = DataManager.get().loadedData.getCompetitionByHash(competition.getHash()).getParticipants().size();
			//}
			return size;
		}
```
If I will uncomment `if` everything works like a charm. If not, I see:
```
new ParticipantsTable()

Internal Error

WindowBuilder encountered unexpected internal error. 

This could be caused by a WindowBuilder bug or by a misconfiguration issue, conflict, partialupdate, etc.

java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke ""packages.Competition.getHash()"" because ""this.this$0.competition"" is null
	at packages.ParticipantsTable$CustomTableModel.getRowCount(ParticipantsTable.java:231)
```
And it happens no matter if `competition` is assigned or created with new in constructor or anywhere.
I use WB 1.14.0.202311200512 and Java 21.

2)

```
public class AdminLogin {
    private class AdminLogin extends JFrame {
        ...

You can't have inner classes with the same name. Remove it and have it be 
```
public class AdminLogin extends JFrame {
   ...
}
```

3)

Each expression needs to end with a ';'. Meaning it's supposed to be `super(""Login"");`

You need the same amount of opening and closing brackets. There's also a missing ; at the end. So it should be:

> setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
> setLayout(new GridLayout(3,2));

I have the project _ModularProject1_, with a stub class _JCalendar_:

```
package test.jcalendar;

import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class JCalendar extends JPanel {
}
```

and the _module-info.java_:

```
module jcalendar {
	requires java.desktop;

	exports test.jcalendar;
}
```

This class is used in a separate project called _ModularProject2_, where the _JCalendar_ is used by the class _MainFrame_:

```
package test;
import java.awt.EventQueue;

import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JPanel;
import javax.swing.border.EmptyBorder;

import test.jcalendar.JCalendar;

public class MainFrame extends JFrame {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private JPanel contentPane;

	/**
	 * Launch the application.
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				try {
					MainFrame frame = new MainFrame();
					frame.setVisible(true);
				} catch (Exception e) {
					e.printStackTrace();
				}
			}
		});
	}

	/**
	 * Create the frame.
	 */
	public MainFrame() {
		setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		setBounds(100, 100, 450, 300);
		contentPane = new JPanel();
		contentPane.setBorder(new EmptyBorder(5, 5, 5, 5));
		contentPane.add(new JCalendar());

		setContentPane(contentPane);
	}

}
```

and the _module-info.java_:

```
module ModularProject2 {
	requires java.desktop;
	requires jcalendar;
}
```

Opening the _MainFrame_ class with the Design editor works without problem...

This tells me that there is no issue with how WindowBuilder handles the module system. Which makes be believe that there is something wrong with your projects and I therefore need to know what your workspace looks like, if you want me to help you.

As a slightly different question: What steps do you take that cause this error? Because the code snippet you show in your initial post doesn't reference the JDateChooser class and should open on its own.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc5yCnv0/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That's correct. The offset from scrolling was ignored. It's something that can very easily be observed when scrolling only by a few pixels.

According to the error message, this should be Java 17.

Alternatively, you can also change the execution environment of your WindowBuilder project to Java 17. Right-click on the project, click `Properties` -> `Java Build Path`. In the `Libraries` tab, select the JRE in the module path, click edit and change it to Java 17.

What seems to be happening is that the following properties of the Java project are not guaranteed to be set, by the time they are requested by WindowBuilder:

- JavaCore.CODEASSIST_LOCAL_PREFIXES
- JavaCore.CODEASSIST_LOCAL_SUFFIXES
- JavaCore.CODEASSIST_FIELD_PREFIXES
- JavaCore.CODEASSIST_FIELD_SUFFIXES

We use those properties to remove any prefixes and suffixes of the variables. Given that we're relying on JDT, I think it makes more sense to simply move on, rather than throwing an exception.

I propose that this removal is done via the following steps:
- Mark the corresponding methods in the WindowBuilder projects as `@Deprecated(forRemoval=true)`
- Adapt the builder to create a warning, whenever the old resource manager is referenced in user code
- Remove the old implementation in an unspecified, future release.

By creating a warning, we let the user know about the planned removal. And by waiting a few releases, we give them time to adjust their code, before we eventually drop the support.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/727/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am experiencing it on OSX.

Not sure if this is relevant, but in the process of trying to recreate the conditions, I went to the Properties tab of the menu item with a lambda expression, and saw this:

I am able to trace where the hanging is coming from, it comes from a .setVisible() call in a JDialog when a lambda expression has one as part of a constructor of an instance it calls. Here are the two files needed to reproduce this:

public class MainUI extends JPanel {
    public MainUI() {
        
        final JButton btnNewButton = new JButton(""New button"");
        btnNewButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(final ActionEvent arg0) {
                System.out.println(""test"");
                WindowInstance picker = new WindowInstance();
            }
        });
        /**
        btnNewButton.addActionListener(e -> {
            System.out.println(""test"");
            WindowInstance picker = new WindowInstance();
        });*/
        add(btnNewButton);
    }
}

and

public class WindowInstance extends JDialog {

    public WindowInstance() {
        initialize();
        setModal(true);
        toFront();
        setAlwaysOnTop(true);
        setVisible(true);
    }
    
    private final void initialize() {
        setBounds(100, 100, 470, 120);
        setTitle(""test"");
    }
}

When using the standard action listener and going into the design tab, it works just fine, but switching to the lambda expression causes it to hang.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc55euqb/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That helped me reproduce the issue. Hm... it seems like this is a general problem when lambda expressions are used and not just something exclusive to the listeners. Here's a small variation of your example, which suffers from the same problem.

```
public class MainUI extends JPanel {
	public MainUI() {

		final JButton btnNewButton = new JButton(""New button"");
		btnNewButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
			public void actionPerformed(final ActionEvent arg0) {
				System.out.println(""test"");
				WindowInstance picker = new WindowInstance();
			}
		});
		test(() -> {
			System.out.println(""test"");
			WindowInstance picker = new WindowInstance();
		});
		add(btnNewButton);
	}

	private void test(Runnable r) {
		r.run();
	}
}

This is the minimal reproducer I came up with, based on your example:

```
public class MyFrame extends JFrame {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new MyFrame();
	}

	public MyFrame() {
		new MyDialog();
		System.out.println(""All done~"");
	}

	public static class MyDialog extends JDialog {
		public MyDialog() {
			setModal(true);
			setVisible(true);
		}
	}
}
```
If I try to run this class using the `main` method, the code blocks indefinitely. If I comment out `setModal(true)`, then everything works and the string is printed to the console.

The same can be observed with your example. And if it doesn't even work with plain Java, I'm not sure how WindowBuilder can do a better job...

Edit: A search led me to [this](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-4636269) problem, so it might even be a proper JDK bug","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc55e8DY/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

What you described is standard modal behavior, its mostly the whole point. If I run your example, a window with just the close/minimize buttons comes up. If you close the window, then you get the string printed.

However, this isn't the behavior that seems to be the problem. There's clearly a difference in my example between a lambda calling the same set of code vs a standard action listener. If I toggle between one by commenting out the other, I get different behavior with the lambda causing eclipse to hang.

If I run your example, a window with just the close/minimize buttons comes up. If you close the window, then you get the string printed.

Right... apologies. I didn't notice the small frame popping up. 
But you have the same behavior with WindowBuilder. The modal dialog is opened, blocking WindowBuilder from switching to the design page. If you click on it, everything works again.

>  There's clearly a difference in my example between a lambda calling the same set of code vs a standard action listener.

When using the lambda expression, WindowBuilder tries to create a proper instance of the dialog, while it doesn't with anonymous classes. My point is that this is a general problem that will pop whenever modal dialogs are used, not just with listeners or lambda expressions.

For example, it starts like this:

Probably the quickest way is just trying to add a JMenuItem and choosing a spot, just moving where the Item will go will quickly make the menu lose focus.

Perhaps my initial approach was too complicated and I have to accept that JDialogs can't be parsed properly. I.e. they should categorically be replaced by a dummy object. Otherwise you have endless combinations to somehow make them modal.

That said, you won't be happy with the preview, even if this code snippet wouldn't cause an error...

Because the empty JFrame is the owner of the dialog, is is treated as the entry point for the editor. Which has the beautiful side-effect that nothing you add to the dialog will be captured.

Meaning you get something like this:
![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/70652978/423db3be-b919-4d40-b5fa-beae480a662e)

```
	DesignerPlugin.exportAllModulesToAllModules() line: 74	
	DesignerPlugin.start(BundleContext) line: 68	
```

This happens when launching an Eclipse IDE-based product from Eclipse IDE itself when Windows Builder plugin is installed in Eclipse. It is also likely that this output is not seen in the Eclipse IDE itself, because `System.out` calls are not redirected to a console or a log file.

It would be very nice to get rid of the very ugly output in the `System.out` console originating from the Windows Builder plugin using `org.burningwave:core` artifact that prints a banner using `org.burningwave.core.assembler.StaticComponentContainer.showBanner()`.

Lines 362-364 in that code, called from its static constructor:

```java
if (!Objects.toBoolean(IterableObjectHelper.resolveValue(onGlobalPropertiesforNamedKey(Configuration.Key.BANNER_HIDE)))) {
				showBanner();
			}
```

produces this output, caught in our System.out redirector pipe:

This output is very surprising and I tought there were some ""virus"" or ""malwear"" causing it, I didn't use Window Builder previously.
(The line `jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$PlatformClassLoader@65209f9b instantiated` comes perhaps from elsewhere).

                 .filter(sf2->sf2.getMethodName().equals(""showBanner"") && sf2.getClassName().equals(""org.burningwave.core.assembler.StaticComponentContainer""))
                 .findFirst()

The Design tab opens and does not display any errors.  It looks like this:
![WindowBuilderDesignTab](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/5721445/09523872-4dfa-4468-a429-4c57da08364e)
The code is in the attached file.  I left out the import statements, but if needed I can add them.
[GearRatioView.txt](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/files/14949972/GearRatioView.txt)

This class obtains data from other classes that communicate with a database and uses a renderer to format the output in a JTable. Additional other classes are used as entity classes to hold the data during processing.   I did not include these but can upload them if needed.  The output (the application runs as it should) displays the data in a formatted table as shown below.  While some of the formatting may look peculiar, I can assure you that it is running properly.
![image](https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/assets/5721445/35d38695-f084-4df2-a2e8-6ca7a761173a)
I have another class in the same project that does not exhibit this behavior but displays in the Design tab correctly.  The difference in the two classes is mostly the table in this one--the other one does not have a table.

I looked this up on Stack Overflow and they were talking about making changes to the eclipse.ini file.  I did as was suggested and then eclipse wouldn’t run at all, so I removed the change and now it starts again, but with the same result—blank panels in the Design tab.

Hm... that matches the stack trace you've provided. For some reason, the array returned by `calculatedGearRatios.calcGearRatios(internalRatios, frontSprockets, rearSprockets)` is `null`, as opposed to containing the table entries.

Would it be possible to provided the remaining Java classes? At this point I'm certain that something goes wrong when processing the Java code.

I’ve attached a zip file with the entire project.  There are 4 packages: controller, model, test and ui.  You can ignore the classes in the test package.  There are two files, DbConfig.java and DbQueries.java, that contain the database connection information and the queries, but I don’t think you’ll need any of the database data.  At this stage of development, the data is hardcoded into the entity classes.  There is one exception and that involves duplicate gear ratios.  Rather than include the data here, I think it would be easier for you to comment out line 270 [ “formatTable();” ] in the GearRatioView.java class, since the behavior of WindowBuilder is the same whether you format the data or not.

Two other files, HashMapDuplicates and TableCellBackgroundRenderer in the controller package are also not used.

The way the program works is that it uses the three distinct sets of data, internal gear ratios, front wheel tooth count and rear wheel tooth count to calculate the ratios..  There are 3 internal gears, 3 front wheel sprockets and 9 rear wheel sprockets.  This yields 81 total gear ratios.  These are displayed in the table.  Many of the ratios repeat themselves so these repetitions are colored the same, but each repetition has its own color.  The first and last columns in the table display the rear tooth count.  The headers are “”Rear teeth” for those columns and the others are the front teeth counts.  These repeat three times—once for each internal gear.

The `rearToothCount` array is -for some reason- not initialized properly. So you end up with `frontToothCount[j] / 0 * internalRatios[i];`, leading to a division by zero. I have to further investigate why this is the case, though.

The problem is that WindowBuilder ignores any modifications to an array that are done outside of the initial declaration.

So instead of:

```
Double[] internalRatios = new Double[3];
internalRatios[0] = lowRatio; 
internalRatios[1] = middleRatio;
internalRatios[2] = highRatio;
spinnerLowInternal.setValue(internalRatios[0]);
```

WindowBuilder only ""sees"":

```
Double[] internalRatios = new Double[3];
spinnerLowInternal.setValue(internalRatios[0]);
```

Meaning the array remains uninitialized. This is also the reason why this problem was fixed after the assignments were moved (`i.e. internalRatios = new Double[] {...}`). I've tested it with the project you provided and now the table is rendered, even without any code adjustments.

The profiler snapshot is already enough to give me a general idea of what's going on.

WindowBuilder is most likely getting stuck while executing the call to `super.dispose()`, i.e. while executing Java-internal code.

As for the reasons, I can only speculate, but I believe that this is a deadlock caused by both the SWT UI thread and the Swing UI thread trying to acquire the same lock.

I would assume that this problem not only shows up with the JDialog but also the JFrame. More so, I would also assume that this is problem is not limited to WindowBuilder but a general problem when mixing SWT and Swing, for example when doing something like this (though perhaps with some additional tweaks):

```
public class Snippet {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Shell shell = new Shell();
		Display display = shell.getDisplay();

		shell.setSize(500, 500);
		shell.setText(""SWT Shell"");
		shell.open();
		display.asyncExec(() -> {
			JFrame frame = new JFrame();
			frame.setSize(500, 500);
			frame.setTitle(""Swing JFrame"");
			frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
			frame.setVisible(true);
			// ...
			frame.dispose();
		});

		while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
			display.readAndDispatch();
		}
	}
}
```

Given that this doesn't happen on Windows or Linux (which is notorious for locking the UI thread), I'm leaning towards calling this an issue within the JRE. And given that I don't have access to a Mac, I won't really be able to further investigate this problem.

1. View the above code with the design viewer
2. Note the preview windows shows a JTabbedPane called `pane`.
3. Change`if (true)` in `setupPane()` to `if(false || true)`.
4. Open the design viewer again

In short: WindowBuilder doesn't evaluate any expressions. Which is why you have a similar effect when creating composites within e.g. a loop.

One could still try to evaluate an boolean expressions if it doesn't contain unknowns (e.g. the `false || true`) you mentioned, but I think that example just serves as an illustration for something like `if (foo()) {...}`.

A list of all types of supported `if` expressions can be found here:
https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/blob/823f712ec93699951b372a33d82c35e91a188a94/org.eclipse.wb.core.java/src/org/eclipse/wb/core/eval/ExecutionFlowUtils.java#L467-L488

But in short:

- boolean literals
- `Beans.isDesignTime()`
- lazy initialization (e.g. `if (value == null) {value = ...}`)

Extending this functionality would require invasive changes which far exceeds the amount of time I am able to invest in this project.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6Ehhhj/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In earlier versions of WindowBuilder, I was able to do various tasks on right click on UI Element. For example, I could have placed a button and then right click on it to selection the action of the button, which would open the code editor with that block of new code in place. Another example would be right click on window to assign the ""Window Closing"" / "" Window Closed"" event to write a code for that. Now only two options are available.
Please fix it or let me know how I can fix it.

I had a look at it in the past and for some reason, the Eclipse compiler behaves differently when an actual Java 8 JRE is used. Any changes would have to be done there. But given that Java 8 is well beyond the end-of-life (for several years by now), it's unlikely that this will ever be fixed.

If you _need_ to build against Java 8, then my suggestion is to use a modern Java version and instead simply adjust the compiler compliance.

Even after a clean install of eclipse and the plugin, I did not get the results I was hoping for.

I managed to identify the culprit but I do not know how to solve it. Apparently the problem is due to GridBagLayout.

This bug greatly limits productivity and makes it almost impossible to program easily... please fix it as soon as possible or at least make public directives to mitigate the problem.

To fix this, you need to manually update GEF using the following update site:

Go to Help -> Install New Software and select both Draw2D and GEF in the dialog.

Recently I made some changes to the scripts I use to automate unzipping of all eclipse files I use. I'm trying to use newer 7za instead of the traditional unzip 6.0 dated April 2009. Checking back with my old scripts I realized that now, WindowBuilder subfolders (inside eclipse/dropins) are hidden to other users but root.

I know that zip files are not ideal for preserving permissions in Unix environments. I see that i could go back to the old unzip, or even change permissions myself easily with chmod…

Even though, let me suggest taking a look at the tools or procedure used for zipping WindowBuilder, as it seems to be different to the other eclipse projects:

`zipinfo -v` says that the origin was `MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT FAT` and recreating proper UNIX permissions there may not be straight… Anyway, it might be worth reviewing this.

I thought that creating the update site archive was something of a Maven task. Looking at this Java code, I see the Files.copy() option set to keep the original file attributes. How were those original attributes set?

What's the hosting OS? Is it naive to try setting them on purpose for each file or directory copied?

```
private static final Set<PosixFilePermission> PERMS_FILE, PERMS_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORY;

	PERMS_FILE = EnumSet.of(OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, GROUP_READ, OTHERS_READ);
	PERMS_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORY = EnumSet.of(OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_EXECUTE,

The zip file for the update site as a whole is generally intended for folks who are behind a firewall and can't use the download.eclipse.org server for updates.  That folks use it to unzip into a dropins folder in an installation is interesting, but of course in that case, it's each to use chmod...

For JustJ's p2 manager I need something that will run on any OS nad can do what this is doing:

```

    }

    // Delete it if it already exists.
    if (Files.isRegularFile(archiveFile))
    {
      Files.delete(archiveFile);
    }

    URI archiveURI = URI.create(""jar:"" + archiveFile.toUri());
    boolean delete = false;
    try (FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.newFileSystem(archiveURI, Map.of(""create"", true)))
    {

Setting Posix permissions worked for me, but I supppose it's because I'm using Ubuntu.
```
Files.copy(file1Ref, file2Ref, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
if (Files.isExecutable(file2Ref) || Files.isDirectory(file2Ref)) {
	Files.setPosixFilePermissions(file2Ref, PERMS_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORY);
} else if (Files.isRegularFile(file2Ref)) {
	Files.setPosixFilePermissions(file2Ref, PERMS_FILE);
}
```
I have been doing some testing about creating a ZIPfs from Java. It mostly worked. I just had to provide an option to include support for Posix attributes.
```
Path file1Ref = Path.of(""ejemplo.txt"");
Path file2Ref = Path.of(""ejemplo2.txt"");
Path zipfileRef = Path.of(""ejemplo.zip"");

URI zipUri = new URI(""jar:file"", zipfileRef.toUri().getPath(), null);

Map<String, String> env = new HashMap<>();
env.put(""enablePosixFileAttributes"", ""true"");
env.put(""create"", ""true"");
FileSystem zipfs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(zipfileRef, env);

Path root = zipfs.getPath(""/"");
file2Ref = zipfs.getPath(root.toString(), file2Ref.toString());

Files.createDirectories(zipfs.getPath(""lib""), PosixFilePermissions.asFileAttribute(PERMS_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORY));
Files.copy(file1Ref, file2Ref, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
if (Files.isExecutable(file2Ref) || Files.isDirectory(file2Ref)) {
	Files.setPosixFilePermissions(file2Ref, PERMS_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORY);
} else if (Files.isRegularFile(file2Ref)) {
	Files.setPosixFilePermissions(file2Ref, PERMS_FILE);
}
zipfs.close();
```
So far, I got:
```
dmartin@alamo:~/eclipse/05.20 EjemplosArchivos$ zipinfo ejemplo.zip 
Archive:  ejemplo.zip
Zip file size: 324 bytes, number of entries: 2
?rwxr-xr-x  1.0 unx        0 bx stor 24-May-21 18:56 lib/
?rw-r--r--  2.0 unx       68 bX defN 24-May-21 18:56 ejemplo2.txt
2 files, 68 bytes uncompressed, 50 bytes compressed:  26.5%
```
…which looks fine, except for those suspicious interrogation marks next to the permission strings. Unzipping worked fine as expected.

You may take a look at the options you set in the try-with-resources statement ```Map.of(""create"", true)```, by the middle of ```createArchive(…)```, as adding there ```""enablePosixFileAttributes"", ""true""``` might as well help.

About my former scripts, I managed to reset permissions easily by fixing my chmod.

That's what I was afraid of... The databinding support is all over the place and I likely missed one or to places :/


> I am also not convinced that I am using the nightly version of WindowBuilder. How do I explicitly enable the nightly?

You can always check what version is installed by looking at the timestamp of the installed features/plugins. You can check them via the main menu under Help -> About Eclipse -> Installation Details

You can install the nightly build either via the ""Help -> Install New Software..."" wizard, using the https://download.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/updates/nightly/latest update site, or via the Eclipse market place if you look for ""WindowBuilder Nightly Nightly"".

    To: org.eclipse.equinox.p2.iu; org.eclipse.wb.layout.group [1.9.600.202405081620,1.9.600.202405081620]
```

I decide to choose the option to ""make my eclipse compatible"" with the installed components which basically means it will remove a load of existing plugins.

See below.

After selecting this Eclipse requests a restart and this still takes a lot longer than I would normally expect from a Mac Apple Silicon M3 with 96GB of RAM.

Once the IDE has restarted I am able to open the Java Form and see the layout as I would expect - however I'm not sure what the implications of the removal of plugings maybe elsewhere along the line.

Hope this helps.

- The Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers comes with the GEF 3.19.0 feature installed.
- WindowBuilder 1.16.0 requires at least GEF 3.20.0

Because GEF 3.20.0 has not been released yet, the Eclipse IDE is unable to update GEF and therefore also unable to properly install WindowBuilder. The result is a broken installation where some plugins are part of 1.15.0 and some part of 1.16.0.

By using ""make my eclipse compatible"", you effectively removed the GEF feature (and everything depending on it) and instead installed the bundles that are part of the WindowBuilder update site (which only contains the GEF bundles, not the feature!).

So in short: Not all dependencies could be resolved because the 2024-06 is not out yet. As Ed mentioned, you can get around this problem by either using the 2024-06 staging repository (or directly the GEF milestone repository) or directly by using the RC1. In both cases, the missing 1.16.0 feature will be available.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6ALt-_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

- Set the default layout manager to e.g. ""BorderLayout"" in the Swing preferences
- Create a new JFrame
- Add a JButton to the content pane.

The layout manager isn't set for the JButton and is therefore using the FlowLayout by default. But WindowBuilder assumes it to be a BorderLayout, as this is what's set in tne preferences.

For some 10 years I have been using Eclipse with Windowbuilder to write java apps.
However with the last couple of updates I've noticed that when I try to change a swing objects properties in the designer, the vertical scrollbar almost completely obscures the drop-down triangle. Only with careful mouse positioning can I get at the icon and change a property.  The attached screenshot should hopefully clarify my issue.
I've tried several command line and environment settings relating to GTK without any success.

Seems a ""thinner"" semi-transparent
scrollbar,   or forcing a re-sizing what of objects is what window builder
needs in this particular context.  Surprised that the dropdown list boxes
don't shrink to accomodate the scrollbar. Scrollbar issue only manifests
itself when you click the ""advanced properties"" icon.

This is way too much trouble trying to install Eclipse, so I have decided to abandon Eclipse altogether & switch to Netbeans: it just works out of the box without all these problems.   
Thank you for your efforts, though: much appreciated.  It seems Eclipse is not really recommended for Linux platforms based on my experience. [Linux Mint 21 XFCE].  I have used various versions of Eclipse since 2008, mostly with success, but at age 76 I haven't enough years left to spend just trying to get something to install correctly.

The error itself seems to suggest that the JCalendar jar you're using is not part of the Java classpath. But without further information, I can't make any assumptions about what exactly goes wrong here.

I tried out the demo that is shipped with JCalendar which at first glance seems to work. So I don't think there is an inherent problem.

When a new instance of this CreationSupport is created, one must also call `setJavaInfo`. The result of this oversight can be observed with the following example:

```java

	private JPanel contentPane;

	/**
	 * Create the frame.
	 */

		contentPane = new JPanel();
		contentPane.setBorder(new EmptyBorder(5, 5, 5, 5));

		setContentPane(contentPane);
		contentPane.setLayout(null);

The error has nothing to do with the version of MigLayout you're using. Regardless, the latest version of WindowBuilder is using  11.4:

https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/blob/44d48e7c7fb16ea420d6c1dad59f66902962354c/target-platform/mvn/wb-mvn.target#L7-L18

But I don't believe that this is the cause of the exception. Based on the stack-trace, this issue might occur when those jars are not located in the workspace...

As a workaround, can you try to remove those jars from the classpath and try to use MigLayout again? If WindowBuilder can't find those dependencies, it should use the ones WindowBuilder is installed with.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6Efa_9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

WindowBuilder makes heavy use of the Eclipse infrastructure, such as the compiler and platform. In order to make it work in other IDEs, they would have to:

- Fully support SWT
- Fully support OSGi

comment,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/865,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6HzmvV,windowbuilder,2278452181,865,NA,ptziegler,70652978,Patrick Ziegler,,NA,2024-08-09T17:53:40Z,2024-08-09T17:53:40Z,"I'm not really sure if this is really a problem with WindowBuilder...

Based on what you've provided, I can only suspect that the version of PDE that has been installed in your IDE is incompatible with the installed version of JDT.

From what I can tell, the method `JavaRuntime.getProvidedVMPackages(...)` has been added roughly [4 months](https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug/commit/b9a8a8160bf2adec5e6e1e41f99939d688dc7a8f#diff-7980a343bde25756f246a7a2c645978fceec0b70bb8d241b6ccf8f10c3cef7e1) ago, _after_ the 2024-03 release. PDE referencing this method makes me believe that this is a newer version, likely from the 2024-06 release.

Now the question becomes: ""How did PDE get updated?"". WindowBuilder has a pretty low bound for the required PDE version, so with any recent Eclipse version, the installation should not cause an update on its own.

https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/blob/6db5686af365a55c768ecb86292fd2fe963763f6/org.eclipse.wb.swt.feature_feature/feature.xml#L21-L24

But your screenshot makes it look like you're using the Eclipse for Java Developers, which doesn't come with PDE installed. This is one of the few cases where the WindowBuilder installation would also install PDE.

More specifically, the latest it can find. So I assume that somewhere in your installation, there is a reference to the 2024-06 update site. But that also means that the problem is because the PDE project hasn't properly updated their dependencies, as the version of JDT they require is higher than what they have specified...

But enough rambling. To fix this issue, I suggest to update your IDE to 2024-06. Though just a fair warning the 2024-06 EPP requires **Java 21**!

- Click on Help -> Install New Software...
- Set https://download.eclipse.org/releases/2024-06/ as the update site in the new dialog
- Uncheck ""Group items by category""
- Search for ""Eclipse IDE for Java Developers""
- Check the item, then continue until the installation is complete
- Restart your IDE

Alternatively, you can also explicitly install PDE from the 2024-03 update site, before installing WindowBuilder. The only reason PDE got installed because it wasn't already. If there's already a recent version in your IDE then there should be no need to update to the one from the 2024-06 release.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6ILNNQ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

- [x] Automatic creation of shared objects/dlls.

When compiling e.g. the GTK bindings, one currently has to go to the C folder, invoke `cmake .` and `make` and then replace the shared objects in the destination folder with the newly created files. It's even more complicated on Windows, where one has to open the project in Visual Studio and start the compilation from there. We need a simple launch configuration in the projects that does all of this with a single click.

- [x] Improved handling of different architectures

The native bindings where created with both 32 and 64 bit in mind. As a result, the native methods are invoked using Integer and Long objects, rather than primitive types, causing a lot of boxing and unboxing within the C layer. Given that 32 bit is effectively unsupported, one could think about completely removing this ambiguity. My suggestion: Exclusively use `long`, so that the architecture with the longest memory addresses is the default. Any architectures with shorter memory addresses have to cast their values to e.g. an `int`.

On the Java side, this wouldn't be noticeable, as we exclusively work with `long` and on the C side, one would have to add a type cast (utilizing the pre-processor for the correct architecture) when calling the proper GTK methods. This would introduce an overhead for non-64-bit architectures but I think is this outweighed by no longer having to work on the Java objects.

- [ ] Moving complexity from C to Java layer

A lot of the logic is implemented directly in the C layer. This makes debugging next to impossible. Here I would propose a similar approach to what the SWT team has done; Have a very thin C layer that only forwards the method call.

For example, the following method could also be implemented in Java, as long as the three gtk methods are accessible.

Yes, I am using java 8, for some UI generated with VisualAge J.
You are right, the problem I posted is fixed under jdk 17.

There is also another problem:

If an embedded panel component has an event multicaster (extends java.awt.AWTEventMulticaster) the loading for such embedded JPanel component also crashes.

I have attached 2 versions of the class that crashes. 
- first version loads, because I commented out  the method that creates the embedded component:
private WBClassTreePanel getWBClassTreePanel() {) component
- second version fails, because the method is not commented out.


Unable to load *.wbp-component.xml description.

For component com.objectview.jdb.ui.WBClassTreePanel.

Check root exception for details.

Are you using Java 8? If so, WindowBuilder will not work. Your best bet is to update to either Java 17 or Java 21 and then adjust the execution environment on the project level.

This has two major problems:

(I) Those tooltips are not translatable and will always show the language the documentation was written in.

(II) Those tooltips are only shown when the JavaDoc is part of the classpath. If WindowBuilder is used with an JRE that doesn't contain the documentation, those tooltips are not show.

There should be a way to contribute your own tooltips and then use the JavaDoc as a fallback mechanism.

Even though the bundles have been removed from the repository, there are still several classes that distinguish between eSWT and SWT, which need to be cleaned up.

As an example:

https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/blob/8ba6671c7435aaf76968e0105262d64c9d01e87a/org.eclipse.wb.swt/src/org/eclipse/wb/internal/swt/support/ToolkitSupport.java#L170-L182

The underlying problem with SWT and eSWT is that both projects use the same package name which as a consequence, forces WindowBuilder to work on plain Object's, rather than the specific types. As far as I can tell, this distinction primarily happens in the *Support classes. 

We need to evaluate whether those classes are still needed and either delete them or adapt them to only support the SWT classes.

To expand on this: WindowBuilder will only consider project dependencies, if the ""same"" dependencies (but perhaps in a different version) aren't used by WindowBuilder itself.

For example, even if you add an older version of SWT to the project classpath, WindowBuilder will continue to use the version that comes with the IDE. This is also the reason why the snapshot mechanism still works, given that there are several instances where an explicit type cast occurs, which otherwise would cause a ClassCastException.

Generally, I think the bundles that WindowBuilder is compiled against should also be the ones that are used in the editor. Which is why I'm leaning towards also ignoring the Nebula jars of the project classpath, just to have a consistent behavior across the board.

Or to rephrase it: The project bundles should only be considered for a) compilation and b) external widgets.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6YDO8Y/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

comment,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/964,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6YZekJ,windowbuilder,2556815625,964,NA,ptziegler,70652978,Patrick Ziegler,,NA,2024-12-20T11:27:08Z,2024-12-20T11:27:08Z,"To summarize: WindowBuilder defines the following fields:

- int[] m_columnOrigins, for each column, contains the x coordinate of the left edge
- int[] m_columnWidths, for each column, contains the width
- int[] m_rowOrigins, for each row, contains the y coordinate of the top edge
- int[] m_rowHeights, for each row, contains the height
- Map<Control, Point> m_controlToXY, for each row, contains its position in the grid

The position is probably the easiest to calculate on-the-fly. The layout already specifies the number of columns. The number of rows can then simply be calculated by the number of widgets divided by the number of columns, rounded up.

e.g. with 5 widgets and 2 columns, the number of rows is ⌈5 / 2⌉ = 3.

The position for each widgets can then simply be determined by iteration:
- (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) (2,0)

The width of a column is the max. width of all containing widgets and similarly the height of a row is the max. height of all containing widgets.

The origin of a column is the min. x coordinate of all containing widgets and similarly, the origin of a row is the min. y coordinate of all containing widgets.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6YZekJ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

comment,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/975,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues/comments/IC_kwDODnAOxc6ZjVjJ,windowbuilder,2576177353,975,NA,ptziegler,70652978,Patrick Ziegler,,NA,2025-01-07T20:37:54Z,2025-01-07T20:37:54Z,"The source code was quite helpful in understanding what's going on. Thanks! Though I fear there is quite a lot of things playing together which ultimately lead to the exception.

WindowBuilder is doesn't execute the following line in the `Choordinates` class. There are a couple of technical reasons for this but to put it simply, `ChoordData` is not a child of the JFrame and therefore ignored.

```java
ChoordData.read();   //Initialize data structures from JSON file.
```

This means that the `choordinates.json` file is not read which then causes the `ChoordData` object to remain uninitalized. When the tuning in the `FretPanel` class is updated, `getCurrentTuning()` returns `-1` and the `if` block is executed, rather than the `else` block, which then causes the string names to remain uninitialized.

```java
public void updateTuning()
    {
    	ChoordData choord_data = ChoordData.getInstance();
    	
    	int tuning_id = choord_data.getCurrentTuning();
    	
    	if (tuning_id == -1)
    	{
    	     mNumStrings = 6;
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		ToneChord tuning = choord_data.getTuning(tuning_id);
    		mNumStrings = tuning.getNumNotes();
    		
    		for (int i=0;i<mNumStrings; ++i)
    		{
    			mStringNames[i] = tuning.getNote(i).getName();
    		}
    	}	
    }
```

But because the `mNumStrings` is set to `6`, this then leads to an exception, because the `drawString` method accesses the still uninitialized string names.

```
for (int y=0; y<mNumStrings; ++y)
{
    g.drawLine(cell_size + cell_half, (y+1) * cell_size + cell_half, cell_size * fret_lines + cell_half, (y+1) * cell_size + cell_half);
    if (mLefty)
    {
        g.drawString(mStringNames[y], cell_half, (y+1) * cell_size + cell_half);
    }
    else
    {
        g.drawString(mStringNames[y], cell_half, (mNumStrings - y) * cell_size + cell_half);
    }
}
```

Even outside of WindowBuilder, you can reproduce this issue simply by renaming `choordinates.json` or by making it otherwise inaccessible by the program.

While it would obviously be ideal for WindowBuilder to handle this special case, I think the most straightforward solution would be to simply restore the default names that were removed as part of your commit:

```java
if (tuning_id == -1)
{
    //No tuning set, default.
        mStringNames[0] = ""E"";
        mStringNames[1] = ""A"";
        mStringNames[2] = ""D"";
        mStringNames[3] = ""G"";
        mStringNames[4] = ""B"";
        mStringNames[5] = ""e"";
        mNumStrings = 6;
}

Thanks!   And I apologize for the state of that code in it's early
prototype state.  It's been through massive refactoring and cleanup since I
filed the report.  The ChoordData instancing seems to be the real key to
understanding.  I should have guessed that!  Once again, apologies for
having put you through looking at early and clumsy code.

Best,
