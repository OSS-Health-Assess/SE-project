The Eclipse [Plug-In Migration Guide](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/4.16/recommended.html?cp=2_3_7_3) mentions:

> Action required: If your bundle has a Require-Bundle: com.ibm.icu or Import-Package: com.ibm.icu.*, remove it.

```
The Developers's Guide continues to encourage the use of OCL embedded in XML CDATA sections. This was necessary with Eclipse 3.2.

Eclipse 3.3, MDT/OCL 1.1 introduced EMF codegen for OCL from EAnnotations that could be maintained within the Sample Ecore Editor, and could be activated from the generated Java model.

Eclipse 3.6, EMF 2.6 introduced validation delegates which MDT/OCL 3.0 exploited to again support OCL in EAnnotations, support activation from Java models, or dynmamic activation via eInvoke.

It is not clear that the oruginal approaches still work. It is certainly unhelpful to describe them without accompanying warnings and pointers to new approaches.

A redirection to http://127.0.0.1:49350/help/topic/org.eclipse.ocl.doc/tutorials/oclinecore/oclInEcoreTutorial.html would be helpful.

Eclipse EMF Validation is moving away from this bugs.eclipse.org issue tracker to https://github.com/eclipse/emf-validation.

If this issue is relevant to you and still present in the latest release:

* Create a new issue at https://github.com/eclipse/emf-validation/issues/.
  * Use as title in GitHub the title of this Bugzilla ticket (may include the bug number or not, at your own convenience)
  * In the GitHub description, start with a link to this bugzilla ticket
  * Optionally add new content to the description if it can helps towards resolution
* Update bugzilla ticket
  * Add to ""See also"" property (up right column) the link to the newly created GitHub issue
  * Add a comment ""Migrated to <link-to-newly-created-GitHub-issue>""
  * Set status as CLOSED MOVED

All issues that remain open will be automatically closed next week or so. Then the Bugzilla component for EMF Validation will be archived and made read-only.
```

Surely ALL Bugzilla are to be MOVED since all must be searchable in the single ticket-space?

The stack trace below shows that org.eclipse.ocl.examples.pivot is started as a consequence of org.eclipse.emf.validation.examples.adapter.Startup.earlyStartUp();

Perhaps org.eclipse.emf.validation.examples.adapter is just a badly coded example.

Perhaps EValidatorAdapter construction should not start the ModelValidationService.

Eclipse EMF Validation is moving away from this bugs.eclipse.org issue tracker to https://github.com/eclipse/emf-validation.

If this issue is relevant to you and still present in the latest release:

* Create a new issue at https://github.com/eclipse/emf-validation/issues/.
  * Use as title in GitHub the title of this Bugzilla ticket (may include the bug number or not, at your own convenience)
  * In the GitHub description, start with a link to this bugzilla ticket
  * Optionally add new content to the description if it can helps towards resolution
* Update bugzilla ticket
  * Add to ""See also"" property (up right column) the link to the newly created GitHub issue
  * Add a comment ""Migrated to <link-to-newly-created-GitHub-issue>""
  * Set status as CLOSED MOVED

All issues that remain open will be automatically closed next week or so. Then the Bugzilla component for EMF Validation will be archived and made read-only.

Almost certainly. Maybe 2014 predates the good suggestions of duplicates for new Bugzillas. This bug has a stronger motivation so perhaps DUP that one to this.

1. You could have the individual bundles only and not include them in any feature
2. You could include the source bundles in your `.sdk` feature
3. You could ship a dedicated `.source` feature collecting all the source bundles

The issue is in 1.13.0 option 3 was chosen, so removing them was simply a breaking change for consumers of that `.source` feature. E.g, we were/are including them in our `.target` definition for our product and this suddenly broke with Eclipse SimRel 2024-09 M3 containing EMF services 1.14.0 RC1.

The only way I see to stay compatible with both versions is to use ugly reflective code to find out which method to invoke at runtime.
