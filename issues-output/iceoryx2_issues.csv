In `iceoryx2_pal/posix/src/windows/mman.rs` the `shm_unlink` call uses `DeleteFileA`. When a file is opened and deleted with this call it successfully returns. If `DeleteFileA` is again called while the file is opened it will set the `GetLastError` to `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` instead of `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`, see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-deletefilea

This causes all `iceoryx2_cal` tests to fail that are using shared memory. Whenever `std::mem::forget` is called in such a concept, the file descriptor is leaked and a subsequent second `remove` call will return permission denied instead of false.

The quick-fix `Errno::set(Errno::ENOENT);` in `iceoryx2_pal/posix/src/windows/mman.rs` (`shm_unlink`) shall be removed and the concept tests must be adjusted.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The error handling strategy must be documented.
* That we use `enum`s as error codes
* A strategy how internal error codes from a lower architectural level are translated into `enum` error codes of an higher architectural level
* How `std::error::Error` and later (when it is in stable) `core::error::Error` is implemented for all error enums.

The issue shall be concluded with a markdown file explaining the above points and showing some code snippets to illustrate them.

## Detailed information

From @elBoberido 

I found another solution in the zstd crate. They use `derive_more` with a feature flag to derive `Error` only on std. This makes would allow `no_std` on stable but without the `Error` trait. Something to think of.

They basically did this
```toml
[dependencies]
derive_more = { version = ""0.99"", default-features = false, features = [""display"", ""from""] }

[features]
default = [""std""]
std = [""derive_more/error""]
```

```rust
#[derive(Debug, derive_more::Display, derive_more::From)]
#[cfg_attr(feature = ""std"", derive(derive_more::Error))]
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum Foo {
    #[display(fmt = ""Bar occurred. Is: {baz}, must be either 1 or 2"")]
    Bar { baz: u8 },
    //...
}
```

The attributes on the enum tags are quite similar to `thiserror` so it wouldn't be too hard to switch between the two crates.

When two `iceoryx2_cal` constructs interact with each other, we need to add some initial versioning information to ensure that not to incompatible versions of the same constructs are interacting. This could lead to undefined behavior and hard to unravel bugs.

They could be, for instance incompatible since the member order of shared management constructs has changed or members have been added/removed. Or the internal communication protocol was updated.

## Solution

Introduce a `const SHM_API_VERSION: u64` constant inside `iceoryx2_cal`, that must be checked before any of these constructs start to interact on an ipc level.
Constructs that use shared memory could add this constant to the beginning, as the first value, to their shared memory. If the construct does not use shared memory, one could create a file and store the number value is binary, or human-readable value, in there.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/14/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently, the `enable_safe_overflow` behavior is part of the service but it should be actually a subscriber property for its buffer behavior.

Comment from @elBoberido : 

I think it is not only a property of the subscriber but also the publisher. If it is only the subscriber one could easily create a denial of service. The publisher also has to opt in for the blocking.

Also the `safe overflow` property shall be renamed. Comments from a past discussion:
 * I would go with `QueueMode`/`QueueType`/`QueueBehavior` and `RingBuffer`/`CircularBuffer` and `Fifo`
 * My only objection is to ""safe"". Ideally the name is descriptive of what it actually does. Also keep in mind that the publisher and subscriber have different strategies to handle the same underlying issue -- there is one publisher, but multiple subscribers -- and each subscriber could have a different contract.

Otherwise, you may encounter a lot of merge conflicts.

Also we could not merge your work before `elkodon` is part of `eclipse-iceoryx` due to the licensing issue. At the moment, your work would be published under the GPL 3.0 but this is only a temporary construct and then we need your explicit agreement to re-license your code under a different license.

Still, I am totally happy that you are on board here, so lets focus on the more interesting technical details. The idea came from the example in these two files:
* https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/iceoryx2/src/service/port_factory/publish_subscribe.rs
* https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/iceoryx2/src/service/port_factory/event.rs

So it would be nice if these two port factories would implement Display and the nice overview that the example is showing would be just a single line of code like:
```rust
let event_name = ServiceName::new(b""MyEventName"")?;
let event = zero_copy::Service::new(&event_name)
     .event()
     .open_or_create()?;

// this line instead of all the lines from the example
println!(""{}"", event);

Listed on the road map is the desire to create a web app GUI that spins up basic webserver and allows the user to introspect an `iceoryx2` system.

Introspection information expected to be displayed would be:

1. [ ] Active `iceoryx2` participants
    1. basic info for each participant like name, up-time, memory usage, etc. (maybe @elfenpiff can list some more requirements here)

A good place to start would be to [look at what exists for iceoryx](https://iceoryx.io/v1.0.1/getting-started/examples/icecrystal/) and re-implement it here.

Looking at `egui` as the basic lib, [using `eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/tree/master) as a starting point.

## Detailed information

The features of the introspection GUI will be dependent on availability of introspection API's to list required info. We should link other related issues here that relate to creating / enabling introspection APIs so that once they are available the features can be added to the GUI.

I guess you settled the discussion :)

Regarding the name it depends a little bit on how we want to use it. We had the idea to create some tooling around an `iox2` command, similar to `ros2`. Like with `cargo`, the user could extend the functionality by just adding `iox2-foo` binary to a specific path and then the user could run `iox2 foo`. The question is now whether the GUI is part of this cmd line tools or something completely different. My gut feeling is that it should be something completely different and we are therefore completely free in choosing a name.

For iceoryx1 there is a Rust TUI called `iceray`. We could reuse that name if you like it. I don't think there are that many users of it so it won't be a big problem to re-purpose it to iceoryx2.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc5uzKzF/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So I already had the idea that it would be nice to have an iceoryx2 service that provides on a pub/sub channel the things you usually see with `htop` for instance.

So this command center would be an interactive interface for all iceoryx2 services which are provided by us and can be extended to custom services.

Let's assume in the future with have microservices like a service monitor, system monitor (htop alternative), deep package introspection (something that can subscribe to everything and we can inspect the transmitted data) and a lot more and everything is bundled together in one ui.
And when a user wants to add something, the only thing they have to do is to compile some module and then it is added to the ui (no idea how to realize this at the moment).

Whatever iceorxy2 apis are available we can make a widget for. The best design would be to make it modular based on use case...like a service introspection widget, a resource usage widget (like htop), etc. that way the end user can pick and choose which widget they need and nothing more.

I think before we start day dreaming let's first get a MVP of a GUI (literally anything that's usable) and build out different use cases from there.

The rough idea is that you use two services, one with a pub/sub and one with an event messaging pattern. Whenever you send your messages via pub/sub, you can signal an event, and the other process will wake up and consume the messages.

This is a bit more manual work but allows you also to be more performant since you can really define your conditions when to trigger across processes. For instance, if you want to trigger only when process P has received 2 messages via service S1 and 4 messages via service S2.
With iceoryx (CPP version) we baked this into the publisher, the API was easier to use but with the downside that in the above case process P add false wakeups that cost a lot of performance.

@Sytten @stjepangolemac would this be something that would help you (temporarily) or would you still require an async API?

Nevertheless, we are aware of the need for an async API and it has a high prio on our side. Currently, we are working on feature parity with old cpp iceoryx and C/C++ bindings - this should be finished soon and then we try to revisit async.

Currently, it is not possible to store any port type easily in a container like a `Vec`. This is due to the fact that the ports, even when they share the same data type, may have different lifetime requirements since they are originating from distinct services or from distinct service variations, like a `zero_copy` and a `process_local` publisher.

`bindgen-0.69.2` is unable to handle macro redefines, see: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/2722

The signal `SIGSTOP` and `SIGCONT` are redefined under ubuntu 20.04 in the included file `bits/signum.h` of `signal.h`. The redefinition turns `SIGCONT` into the unfetchable signal `SIGSTOP` which leads to a failure in the `sigaction` call.

The quick fix is to comment out the `Continue` signal in the abstraction, since it is also nowhere used. When the bindgen bug report is closed, we can revert the change and close the issue.

1. [x] comment out `Continue` signal in `signal.rs`
2. [ ] comment in `Continue` signal after bindgen bugfix

I cannot reproduce it locally, but it seems to occur when the shared memory is zeroed. We zero it to ensure that the target has really enough memory available. If this fails `SIGABRT` or another signal is raised which we fetch to provide a detailed error message.

I suspect that linux tegra maybe has a different subset of fetchable signals than other linux distributions. I added a more detailed error output to identify this signal which is registered via `sigaction`.

@passchaos @fengtuo58

Could you please retry the benchmark from current main and provide the log full log output? Hopefully, this identifies the signal and helps to fix this issue.

Under ubuntu,`SIGCONT` actually uses the value 18, but the value in the automatically generated bindings is 19, which actually corresponds to `SIGSTOP`, but this signal cannot use `sigaction` function

So what is the problem, I go over what the C pre-processor is doing.
1. Some process includes `/usr/include/signal.h` - in this case our platform with the signal abstraction
2. In this header we include `/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/signum.h` 
  2.1 Here we include `/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/signum-generic.h`, this defines all signals als C macros
  2.2 **10 lines below we `undef` all signals again and redefine them**

In step 2.2 bindgen seems to lose it. It keeps the old macro values and this causes a screw up. But I have no idea why in the first place the value of `SIGCONT` and `SIGSTOP` are swapped, but they are.

So somehow we have to make bindgen aware that here are potentially macros defined, undefined, defined again.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc5xD3RI/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So the bug is in `bindgen-0.65.1` (and current `0.69.2`). The following C code is not translated correctly.
```c
#define A 1
#define B 2

#undef A
#define A 2
#undef B
#define B 1

The result should that `A == 2` and `B == 1` but the generated file shows

```rust

To cite @elBoberido 

Btw, for config files it is nicer to have kebab-case for the variable names. You just need to use `#[serde(rename_all = ""kebab-case"")]`. Just in case you want to change it in a future version.

Currently, iceoryx2 only supports transmission types with a compile time fixed size. There are already types available that support having a fixed size at runtime, but the end user API does not provide an interface to create structs containing them.

The idea would be to introduce a trait to support runtime fixed size types.

```rust
pub trait RuntimeFixedSizeTypeConfig {}

pub trait RuntimeFixedSizeType {
  type Config: RuntimeFixedSizeTypeConfig;
  fn required_memory_size(config: Self::Config) -> usize;
  fn init(&self, allocator: ShmAllocator);
}
```

The user would implement the trait and could use it like:

```rust
let service = zero_copy::Service::new(&service_name)
    .publish_subscribe()
    .open_or_create::<MyDynamicType>()?;

let publisher = service.publisher()
    .max_dynamic_type_size(1024)
    .create()?;

let sample = publisher.loan_uninit(my_dynamic_type_config)?;
sample.write_payload(...);

sample.send();

A ROS2-like CLI enabling users to interact with `iceoryx2` from the terminal would be a useful addition for users to aid development of applications. 

## Detailed information

An summary of the capabilities of the ROS 2 CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/ros2_cheats_sheet/blob/master/cli/cli_cheats_sheet.pdf). NOTE: The `iceoryx2` does not need to necessarily provide all of the same functionality, this should just be taken as inspiration for what could be useful.

Proposal for initial for CLI functionality:

1. `introspect` - introspect the internals of the `iceoryx2` system (e.g. things stored in shared memory)
1. `processes` - manage processes running `iceoryx2` 
1. `pub` - publish to the `iceoryx2` system from the terminal
1. `rpc` - execute `iceoryx2` rpc operations from the terminal
1. `services` - manage the services currently available in `iceoryx2`
1. `sub` - subscribe to the `iceoryx2` system from the terminal

## Tasks

Follow up from #106:
1. [x] Address TODOs in commands.rs
1. [x] Ensure implementation of commands.rs follows Rust conventions
1. [x] Display installed commands before development commands
1. [x] Work out how to test command lookup in file system
1. [x] Add `iceoryx2-cli` to `internal/scripts/crates_io_publish_script.sh` to release it.

Follow up from #371:
1. [ ] Factor out CLI setup into common lib: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/pull/371#discussion_r1766353301

Currently, it is impossible to store a service with its corresponding ports and corresponding samples in a  cache inside one struct due to the problems of Rust self referencing structs.

So something like:
```rust
struct MyThing {
  service: Box<dyn Service<MessageType>>,
  subscriber: Box<dyn Subscribe<MessageType>>,
  sample_cache: Vec<Box<dyn Payload<MessageType>>>,
}
```

cannot be realized. Every sample in the `sample_cache` holds a reference to the `subscriber` to release itself when going out of scope. Also, the `subscriber` holds a reference to `service` to remove it from the service when it goes out of scope.

The solution is, that the underlying construct, that performs the task, is stored in an `Rc` and has a shared ownership. When this is done, the lifetime restrictions should be lifted.

Introduce `Rc` and lift lifetime restrictions

When multiple processes are startup concurrently and are creating the same service with `open_or_create` it can happen that all processes detect the service as non-existing.

When then all processes start creating the service, all except one will fail creating the service. A better option would be that the processes that fail creating the service retry to open the service again.

The linux call `memfd` has the ability to seal memory files, meaning making them immutable for the rest of their lifetime. Choosing them in a shared memory concept could solve data races that can occur in IPC communication.

```
publisher_history_size
subscriber_max_buffer_size 
enable_safe_overflow

```

Part 1 of my issue is that I just cant seem to move the messages around very fast, its less than 1k messages per second on my 7900x. Ive tried debug and release builds and haven't noticed any significant difference.

Part 2 of my issue is that I cant seem to make it reliable. If I just give it a big number for publisher_history_size and subscriber_max_buffer_size it seems to be mostly reliable but occasionally I will still see publisher.send(...) return 0 and print something like this to the console. Rather than return 0 I would have thought it would return an error.

For Part 2 of your error message, this is a bug, and it seems I have miscalculated the required size of the retrieve channel - possibly the usual off by one error ;) . I will fix this!

For Part 1. I think the bottleneck is maybe the line `sleep(CYCLE_TIME);` with a cycle time of 1 ns. In the worst case, the process states to the OS scheduler, please let me sleep and then is wakened up some time later and this procedure of -scheduling another process and then wake the current process up again and continue - can be very expensive.
But the solution is simple: remove the line `sleep(CYCLE_TIME);` and let's see if it changes anything.

1. I still encountered one very rare occasions the retrieve buffer is full issue
2. We need to introduce a flag to track the connection creation

I also run a `mbw` a memory benchmark and my theoretical memory maximum is around ~8500 MiB/s. This throughput here, with `BigData` having a size of 128 KiB and ~20K samples, is around ~2450 MiB/s, so there is maybe still space left to the top. But iceoryx2 is a young library, and we did not yet start with the extreme performance optimizations. But I also think that ~8500 MiB/s is a more theoretical maximum, we have OS interference when working with multiple processes, wakeups etc. and also need to sync memory between CPU cores - this all takes time and is not included in the measurement from above.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc50WZ-w/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The error message on Windows that the file already exists is expected and in the next step iceoryx tries to open it when it already exists. But we have to get rid of the error message, otherwise it's a bit confusing.

And I think Windows seems to have a totally new problem here - misaligned pointers :/ ... Theoretically, this can only happen when the shared memory is not aligned - but it should be always page size aligned. I have to dig into this.

There are still some issues left I will tackle in the next days:

1. Calling this concurrently in busy loops from multiple processes may result in a state where no new services can be created.
```rust
let service = zero_copy::Service::new(&service_name)
        .publish_subscribe()
        .open_or_create::<BigMessage>()?;
// do stuff
drop(service);
```

2. Creating and destroying `Listener`s in a busy loop may lead to connection failures on `Notifier` side. The tests are already written, and the solution is a combination of shared memory bit set and a trigger like semaphore, unix domain socket etc. - in the end the iceoryx1 approach.

3. When in a busy loop Publishers are created and destroyed, it can cause the Subscriber to release the sample to the wrong publisher. This is already fixed in the PR #144 

But your code should now be completely stable. So if you have time to confirm this, I would close the issue and ping you on the other issues when the two remaining problems are also fixed.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc52I7bt/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

**Observed result or behaviour:**
Assuming the following scenario:
- capacity is 1 (underlying buffer capacity is 2)
- queue is full
- `pop` loads write position
- producer does an overflowing push
- `pop` loads read position
- read and write position are equal -> empty

Theoretically, this can happen for each `pop` operation if the `push` frequency is high enough. It can also happen for larger capacities but the probability is not as hight since the producer has to push more often within the window of the two load operations in `pop`

**Expected result or behaviour:**
The queue should detect the race and repeat the pop operation until it is successful if the queue is not empty.

It's hard to get lock-free code right and one can easily introduce races. [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) and [Loom](https://crates.io/crates/loom) can help to find those races

## Detailed information

Miri and Loom can help to harden to lock-free structures. We need to check the limits on these tools and  how to integrate them into the CI.

Here is a small example of a FIFO with a wrong memory ordering on line 98: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=7e42e80e68c48de09c7615422eea3c00

I ran into some issues and figured i might share what I learned here. 
* `thread::scope` doesn't exist in loom directly. There is a [PR](https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom/pull/312) to the loom repo that adds it.
* `loom::sync::barrier` exists only to allow code to compile it throws at runtime and using std::sync::barrier results in deadlocks for the current tests. These are more or less expected because loom is an intentionally unfair scheduler. I haven't spent enough time to figure out how to make the mpmc tests run properly without the barriers. 
* `FixedSizeContainer` for non primitive types segfaults during construction and I don't know enough to determine if its a loom problem, a FixedSizeContainer problem, or a problem with how i adapted the code to use loom::cell::UnsafeCell. 
* `UnsafeCell` The key change as I understand it revolves around not using * or .get() on the UnsafeCell but instead, refactoring to use `with` and `with_mut` depending on if you need read or write access to the contents. The required changes weren't bad in the lock-free area but I didn't do any analysis on what it would mean to the rest of the codebase.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc50kuSY/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

interestingly while trying to feel this error out, I tried switching to `RelocatablePointer<UnsafeCell<AtomicU32>>`instead of `RelocatablePointer<UnsafeCell<u32>>` for UniqueIndexSet.data_ptr. Then I changed the helpers in UniqueIndexSet like this

```
fn get_next_free_index(&self, index: u32) -> u32 {
        unsafe {
            (*(*self.data_ptr.as_ptr().offset(index as isize)).get()).load(Ordering::Relaxed)
        }
    }
    #[allow(clippy::mut_from_ref)]
    fn set_next_free_index(&self, index: u32, value: u32) {
        #[deny(clippy::mut_from_ref)]
        unsafe {
            (*(*self.data_ptr.as_ptr().offset(index as isize)).get()).store(value, Ordering::Relaxed);
        }
    }
```

As well as replacing the helper usages where appropriate. This made the tests pass under miri but I don't have any confidence in my ability to reason about Ordering::Relaxed so I fear I might be masking something.

All over the code the `uuid` is used as basis for a files and therefore for the `FileName`. It is always safe to convert the uuid to a file name, nevertheless the user has to write `unsafe {}` blocks with a safety statement that it is safe. A better approach would be to bake this all in, into its own uuid type.

**Fix:**
The methods `Publisher|Subscriber::populate_{subscriber|publisher}_channels()` both had the problem that when the corresponding port goes out of scope and is replaced with a new port, that this is not detected and the old connection is kept.

**Observed result or behaviour:**
When either a publisher or subscriber is already running, and a new counterpart is started (subscriber/publisher) they sometimes fail to connect. This can be fixed when another publisher or subscriber is connecting - it seems that the ports are sometimes not informed about new participants.

**Expected result or behaviour:**
Connecting ports always works

**Conditions where it occurred / Performed steps:**
Start a single publisher and start stop subscriber multiple times with some time in between.

The problem had two causes:
 * The publisher did not recycle samples that were stored in the receive channel, only the retrieve channel was recycled
 * When the subscriber dies and has loaned samples, all those samples leak

The `UsedChunkList` from iceoryx1 was ported and whenever a connection is terminated all samples from the `UsedChunkList` will be recycled.

When a subscriber is stopped and reconnected, it can lead to a OutOfMemory error on the publisher side.

No out of memory.

**Fix:**
On publisher side, for the offset calculations when using a pool allocator, we had the implicit requirement that the offsets start at zero and are a multiple of the bucket size. Introducing for the normal allocators a method that returns the smallest start point of the payload and for the shm allocators a method that returns the relative payload starting offset and use this in the SharedMemory concept as the starting point fixed the problem.

When a new subscriber connects, the publisher suddenly retrieves an invalid sample.

When a service object (`PortFactory`) goes out of scope, the service can no longer be found, but all existing ports are able to continue communication. When now the same service is created again, it fails since old ports and the dynamic service info is still existing.

Two approaches are possible.
1. Remove the dynamic service info and create new ports that no longer are connected to the old existing ports - may surprise the user.
2. Verify that the dynamic service info belongs to a former service with the identical configuration, and reuse it again. Would allow the newly created service to create ports that can communicate with the existing ones.

## Detailed information

To verify that the service has the identical static service configuration, we need to hash the object and compare the hashes. If they are equal, the dynamic service info can be reused.
This also means that the hash must be stored in the dynamic service info.

This is the case when the message type is equal. When now a service has the same message type does interpret the data differently, you have a problem.
But somehow it feels that this problem is not just restricted to recreating services, but also when a publisher or subscriber in the middle misinterpret the data - like the Mars Climate Orbiter.

The POSIX call `clock_gettime` is extremely costly, especially on certain AMD CPUs, therefore we should avoid it as much as possible.
We observed that the latency in our benchmark may increase from `190ns` to over `2000ns` just because of this call.

## Detailed information

 * [ ] Remove the time-stamp from the header 
 * [ ] Use overflowing behavior in the benchmark setup (default behavior) to not use adaptive wait.

Currently, the event cannot handle trigger overflows and the notifier receives connection failures when the listener goes out of scope while the notifier is triggering. Furthermore, the tests in `service_event_tests.rs` named `concurrent***` segfault sometimes.

To address the issues:
* [ ] All concept shall be based on the bitset from iceoryx1
* [ ] All ignored tests from `service_event_tests.rs` must be unignored 
* [ ] Introduce event tests with many reconnecting listeners for many reconnecting notifiers.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/139/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Fixed size containers often have a capacity member variable that is never changed during their lifetime. A custom strong type that can be only set once with `new` and can be read via `Deref` would reflect this in the API.

ran the two binary pub sub example in README in both debug and release. Also tried changing the config to change the root path, did not help.

This could happen when for whatever reason a process is non-gracefully killed. Could you please go into the directory `c:\temp\` and remove the directory `iceoryx2` and every file starting with the prefix `iox2_` and retry again?

Currently, we are working on a mechanism to detect stale resources and clean them up automatically so that you do not have to do this manually. This should come in 0.3.0 beginning of April.

If this does not work, could you please attach the full log file so that I can dig into this.

The solution is to make the logger available in the platform, but we have to be careful since the `iceoryx2-pal-posix` crate may also provide all the logging functionality required for logging in a `no_std` environment.

**Operating system:**

**Observed result or behaviour:**
Calling `fchmod` with a file descriptor belonging to a shared memory always results in (`errno == 2 (EINVAL)`) since shared memory file descriptors are not supported?!

**ToDo:**
* [ ] Remove all quick fixes from mac os platform. (`shm_open` and `fchmod`)

Currently, when a service is created by two parties concurrently, some of the error codes are not too helpful and sometimes misleading. Similar with concurrently opening and closing a service.

This are the error codes which are triggered in `service_tests.rs`

PublishSubscribeCreateError::AlreadyExists,
PublishSubscribeCreateError::Corrupted,
PublishSubscribeCreateError::IsBeingCreatedByAnotherInstance,

```rust
PublishSubscribeOpenError::DoesNotExist,

On the topic of the dynamic pub/sub example, I don't fully understand how it works, it seems like it is essentially just breaking up the larger data into multiple publishes? So based on my understanding I'd have to reassemble the data on the other end, is that correct?

Lastly, I believe we used iceoryx zero-copy RMW for ROS2 (RouDI) (though on linux, not mac) at a previous company I was at, and we were sending multiple large images in a single message through zero-copy, and I had never run into an issue like this. Is there some difference here? Is it a iceoryx2, or mac, or rust specific issue?

I think that `cargo test --release` is slightly different than the `cargo run --release` mode but I cannot name any specific differences.

> On the topic of the dynamic pub/sub example, I don't fully understand how it works, it seems like it is essentially just breaking up the larger data into multiple publishes? 

No, the idea is to send a slice, and you can define the worst-case size on the publisher's side. The example is that you want to send camera data, and at runtime you detect a 720p camera. Therefore, you know your image size is 4 * 1280 * 720 - so you create a publisher with this worst-case size. After some runtime, the camera is disconnected and replaced with a 4k camera, and your image size becomes 4 * 3840 * 2160. You remove the old publisher and create a new one with a larger worst-case size.
If the old camera is connected again you can either stick to the current worst-case size or remove the new publisher again and create a new one with a smaller size.

I think I need to write a blog article to clarify this a bit more in detail.

In the future this shall all happen behind the scenes so that you do not have to recreate a publisher anymore. But for now it is already a big improvement compared to iceoryx1.

> Lastly, I believe we used iceoryx zero-copy RMW for ROS2 (RouDI) (though on linux, not mac) at a previous company I was at, and we were sending multiple large images in a single message through zero-copy, and I had never run into an issue like this. Is there some difference here? Is it a iceoryx2, or mac, or rust specific issue?

It is a rust-specific issue. Take a look at this here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53827
This is exactly the problem behind the scenes since the `FixedSizeVector<u8, 100000000>` has an array member of `[MaybeUninit<u8>, 100000000]` that overflows the stack when you want to put it into the heap like

```rust
let heap_array = Box::new([0; 100000000]);
```

But we already started solving this. The idea is to introduce a `PlacementNew` trait

```rust
pub trait PlacementNew: Sized {
    type NewParam;
    
    fn placement_new(this: &mut MaybeUninit<Self>, param: &Self::NewParam);
}
```

in combination with a proc derive `placement_new` macro so that the user can use it like:

```rust
#[derive(placement_new)]
struct MyTransmissionType {
  data: FixedSizeVec<u64, 1234>,
  whatever: FixedSizeString<4567>,
}
```

> Just another data point, I tried the dynamic publisher but just set max slice length to the size of the vec and that seems to work for me:

Perfect :)

In the future we want to integrate also `RelocatableVec` which you could use like this

```rust
struct CameraData {
  image: RelocatableVec<u8>,
  camera_details: FixedSizeString<128>,
  whatever: u64
}

// ...

let sample = publisher.loan()?;
sample.image.reserve(SIZE_OF_CAMERA_IMAGE);
// ...
sample.image.push(123);
```

This is what I ended up implementing, I abstracted the publisher to automatically do this. The benefit of this is actually that I can publish non-fixed sizes like a serialized protobuf, which actually works slightly better for us, though I'm sure at the cost of some performance?

This is close to what I was originally trying to implement (though with the FixedSizeVec) as I'm used to the requirement of compile time fixed sizes from Iceoryx / RouDI. The relocatable vec solution seems good too.

Thanks for the help! I'm currently unblocked now, but looking forward to trying out the fixes when they land.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc5_T2xk/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When a large data type that does not fit into the stack is transmitted via shared memory we encounter a stack overflow. It is caused by a lacking placement new functionality in Rust, see: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53827

Example:

We need to add a mechanism so that 

```rust

let sample = publisher.loan_uninit()?;
let sample = sample.write_payload(LargeDataType::default());

I can't entirely agree with calling this reliable when this algorithm depends on a release optimization. For whatever reason, this could be turned off in some corner cases, or the compiler may not be able to realize that it can perform this optimization.

And what if the user, who is using iceoryx, integrates this into unit tests - then it will cause problems again. With this we would also enforce our users to always build in release mode, also during development, which would cause additional problems.

There is now :smile:! In our roadmap, we listed all the languages that came to our mind, and Go just slipped it, partly because I think none of our core contributors ever got in touch with Go.

Would you be willing to help us out? Maybe you could push the Go language binding here or, as an alternative, review the corresponding pull requests — this would take much more time since we currently have other tasks and would need to learn the Go basics as well.

The tasks that would need to be done:
1. Add the files required for the language binding under `iceoryx2-lang/go` (see here, our intermediate state: https://github.com/elBoberido/iceoryx2/tree/iox2-210-create-c-language-binding)
2. Port all examples from `examples/rust` to Go and store them under `examples/go`
3. Integrate examples into CI so that they are running there as well (this can be done completely on our side)

It is also possible to refactor iceoryx so that it does not require a central daemon. But we aimed for iceoryx2 and Rust since we think that this combination has the most promising future.

> I am interested in using C++binding or other methods to combine Iceoryx2 with Cyclonedds to create a new version of dds or implement related tasks in RMW for ROS2.

@elBoberido is currently working on the C and, later, the C++ bindings. They should be available in the next two months. 
When you take a look at our [Roadmap](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) you see that we also plan to have a DDS gateway and a ROS2 RMW binding.

If you are interested, we could cooperate here. As soon as the C API for iceoryx2 stands, we could start with an RMW binding for iceoryx2 and use the existing [iceoryx RMW binding](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_iceoryx) as a template. If you like, you could take care of the iceoryx2 RMW binding and this would make a lot of iceoryx developers happy :) ...

Services may have properties that correspond to sensors or other constraints that cannot be represented in the context of iceoryx2. Therefore, the user needs the ability to set user-defined properties.

## Detailed information

```rust
let service = zero_copy::Service::new(&service_name)
  // START: user-defined service properties
    .custom_property(""CameraResolution"", ""1920x1080"")
    .custom_property(""Framerate"", ""60"")
  // END: user-defined service properties
    .publish_subscribe::<TransmissionData>()
    .open_or_create()?;
```

The user-defined service properties can be read via the services static config:

```rust
let camera_resolution = service.static_config()
                               .custom_property(""CameraResolution"");

From @elBoberido 
I think this is error prone. A user should always explicitly provide a config. I think this is a general flaw in the API. everywhere a config is required it should explicitly be passed to the function. Worst case would be a line with `let config = Config::get_global_config();`. The way it is handled now makes it error prone when a user moves to a custom config and does not realize that instead of `list`, `list_with_custom_config` needs to be called.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/238/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For your information, I post my client code here. I have read the current C example in iceoryx2, but it is only single-threaded. I suggest considering the C++ multi-thread scenario. Because we usually call the APIs in a spawned thread.

This is the C++ part:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include ""rust_part.h""
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>
#include ""unistd.h""
#include ""build/rust_part/rust_part.h""

void test_request_launch_kernel(int base_id) {
    for(int i=0;i<100;i++) {
        std::cout<<""C++ call launch "" << base_id+i << std::endl;
        rust_part::send_request_to_server(base_id+i);
        std::cout<<""C++ finished call launch "" << base_id+i << std::endl;
        usleep(10);
    }
}

int main()
{
    rust_part::launch_request_service_daemon();
    rust_part::launch_reply_service_daemon();
    std::thread th2(test_request_launch_kernel, 0);
    std::thread th3(test_request_launch_kernel, 10000);
    std::thread th4(test_request_launch_kernel, 10000000);
    th2.join();
    th3.join();
    th4.join();
    return 0;
}
```

Rust part client code:
```rust
#[cxx::bridge]

    #[namespace = ""rust_part""]
    extern ""Rust"" {

Introspection and the C API require the usage of untyped services so that a service created with the C API can work together with strongly typed rust services.

## Detailed information

The static config already contains a `TypeDetails` struct that contains type name as a string and layout for the header and the payload. When a service is created the C API can override those entries so that a strongly typed rust service can connect to such a C created service, the same goes for open.

To satisfy the introspection, the name could be optional and the layout is a minimum requirement so that the introspection would just define `layout(align = 1, size = 1)` as minimum requirement and could connect to every service.

### Create/open untyped service with explicit service hint:

```rust
let service = node
    .service_builder(""foo"".try_into()?)
    .publish_subscribe::<[u8]>()
    .set_type_info(TypeDetails{layout: ..., type_name: ...})
    .open_or_create()?;
```

* the type `[u8]` would be overridden by the provided type name in `set_type_info`
* two services can only connect if they have the same `TypeDetails`, for other types than `[u8]` it is internally done by the already implemented logic
* `set_type_info` can only be called when the payload type is `[u8]`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/252/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The files should be based on the ones from the `eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx` repo but can be adjusted to match the formatting of `rustfmt` more closely.

## Tasks

- [x] add a `.clang-format` file
  - based on the one from iceoryx1 but maybe adjusted to mimic the `rustfmt` formatting more closely
- [x] add a `.clang-tidy` file
  - also based on the ton from iceoryx1 
- [x] CI check for `clang-tidy` and `clang-format`

I had a similar issue with the socket macros `CMSG_FIRSTHDR` and so on, which I solved by creating a c file, compile it and call the function of that C file.

See: [`socket_macros.c`](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/iceoryx2-pal/posix/src/c/socket_macros.c)

I added the file in the [`build.rs`](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/iceoryx2-pal/posix/build.rs) file,see:
```rust
 println!(""cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/c/socket_macros.c"");
 cc::Build::new()
     .file(""src/c/socket_macros.c"")
     .compile(""libsocket_macros.a"");
```

and called then the c function defined inside this file instead of the POSIX API.

This could be a viable solution here as well, that we define an `iox2_dirfd` function that calls the `dirfd` posix function and inside the rust platform we call `iox2_dirfd` instead of `dirfd`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6D3web/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

>  Looking at the repo, can I guess it would be better for me to either wait for Nodes to be released.

We plan to release the Nodes with the full cleanup feature at the beginning of August so if you are able to wait a little longer I would recommend waiting a bit more since the API breaks a little more often on `main`. But we are confident that the API is becoming much more stable after release v0.4 (which is coming in the beginning of August).

> what the semantics are for when they are reused from when a previous process has died etc.

When the Nodes with the cleanup feature are implemented then a node alive check is performed whenever you open or close a service. If a dead Node/process is detected, all of its resources are cleaned up for you - this happens behind the scenes, and you have to do nothing at all. Furthermore, we will also provide an API so you can write your centralized node monitor process that performs the cleanup immediately. Still, for the everyday use case, it is sufficient for every process to do it on its own when it starts or stops using a service.

> like how to create them reliably (permission issues on Windows)

Could you elaborate this in more detail? Were you sometimes unable to create services due to insufficient permissions? Btw. in windows you can remove all the stale resources by hand for now, see: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/FAQ.md#a-crash-leads-to-the-failure-publishsubscribeopenerrorunabletoopendynamicserviceinformation

Great project you have here. I'm new to iceoryx and shmem IPC in general but I'm trying to model a simple request-reply mechanism on top of the existing pub-sub communication. I understand it is part of the roadmap but just to have something working in the meantime, I made a simple solution that requires reusing the allocated memory for a sample.

So I tried reusing the same memory segment:

```rs
fn publisher() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    println!(""Publisher"");

    let node = NodeBuilder::new().create::<zero_copy::Service>()?;
    let service = node
        .service_builder(""test/path"".try_into()?)
        .publish_subscribe::<u64>()
        .max_publishers(1)
        .max_subscribers(1)
        .open_or_create()?;

    let publisher = service.publisher_builder().max_loaned_samples(1).create()?;
    let sample = publisher.loan_uninit()?;
    let _ = sample.write_payload(1234);

    while let NodeEvent::Tick = node.wait(CYCLE_TIME) {
        let sample = publisher.loan_uninit()?;
        sample.send()?;

        println!(""Sent existing"");
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

```rs
fn subscriber() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    println!(""Subscriber"");

    let node = NodeBuilder::new().create::<zero_copy::Service>()?;
    let service = node
        .service_builder(""test/path"".try_into()?)
        .publish_subscribe::<u64>()
        .max_publishers(1)
        .max_subscribers(1)
        .open_or_create()?;

    let subscriber = service.subscriber_builder().create()?;

    while let NodeEvent::Tick = node.wait(CYCLE_TIME) {
        while let Some(sample) = subscriber.receive()? {
            println!(""Received: {:?}"", sample.payload());
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

I expected the subscriber process to output `Recieved: 1234` repeatedly but instead got: 

```
Received: 1234
Received: 0
Received: 1234
Received: 0
Received: 1234
Received: 0
Received: 1234
Received: 0
...
```

## Improvement Suggestion

Tbh, I'm not sure if this is the bug or an expected behavior as I haven't dived too deep into the code.
But it would be nice to have a way to reuse the same loaned memory in a consistent way.

We already discussed some solutions but did not find the time to implement them.

`loan_uninit` returns a `SampleMut<MaybeUninit<T>>` and this version should not provide a `send` method, only `SampleMut<T>` should, and this you can acquire with 

```rust
let sample = publisher.loan_uninit()?;
let sample = sample.write_payload(1234); // SampleMut<MaybeUninit<T>> becomes SampleMut<T>
```

What happens behind the scenes here is that:
1. You acquire memory with `let sample = publisher.loan_uninit()?;`
2. The value `1234` is written into the memory position
3. The `SampleMut` is going out of scope and the memory is released
4. In the loop `let sample = publisher.loan_uninit()?;` acquires the same memory again where still the `1234` is written to
5. `sample.send()?;` sends technically uninitialized memory to the subscriber (due to our API bug)
6. In the next iteration you acquire another sample, this piece of memory was never used so you get the zeroed memory from the OS and send it
7. In the meantime, the subscriber printed the sample content, the sample went out of scope on subscriber side and the memory with the content `1234` becomes available again.
8. The publisher loans the memory with the `1234` content again and the game restarts.

> But it would be nice to have a way to reuse the same loaned memory in a consistent way.

This is something we consider currently when designing request response, but this is not always possible. Just think of the use case where one client sends a request to two servers and receives two responses. But for a many client to one server scenario it could work.

But if you build request response on top of our current publish subscribe architecture you will not be able to reuse the received sample and write additional data into it. The reason is that every publisher comes with its own data segment and there are internal checks that should ensure that you do not send samples that do not belong to your data segment.

However, happy news, we are aiming to finish the request-response implementation in September/October!

So your code releases the sample immediately after `write_payload`. The first iteration of the loop gets that release sample and since the memory is not touched, it holds the value you wrote before.

I thought it would make certain patterns possible. In my case, in trying to implement a contrived request-response communication pattern, I landed on a queue-based solution (there's just one client and one server communicating). The client would write its chunked request to the same in-memory queue (pushing chunks continuously) and the receiver/server would pick it up from there -- sending back some ack. This requires that a publisher holds onto the same memory where it mutates the queue repeatedly. Maybe a kind of sample that can be resent without being owned.

I may be totally off here but I believe no real `send`ing is taking place since the pub-sub processes have access to the same memory and it is zero-copy. So `send` is really just a signalling mechanism.

> However, happy news, we are aiming to finish the request-response implementation in September/October!

Sweet. Can't wait since that is really what I need. I'm willing to build a sub-optimal hack that I can use now until then.

Well, this is exactly like iceoryx works. The `loan` call takes memory shared between the processes and `send` adds a pointer to that memory to the queue for the consumer + some bookkeeping, memory synchronization, etc. So you have to loan memory, write data to that memory and then send it. There is also the event messaging pattern  which can be combined with publish-subscribe to notify the consumer about new data in the queue, instead of having the consumer poll the queue.

As it turned out `cdylib`s do not play well with integration tests. The `cdylib` is build
with `panic=""abort""` but the tests require `panic=""unwind""`. This results in building the lib
twice if there are integration tests and leads to the following warning and eventually to build failures.

> warning: output filename collision.
> The lib target `iceoryx2_ffi` in package `iceoryx2-ffi v0.3.0 (C:\Users\ekxide\iceoryx2\iceoryx2-ffi\ffi)` has the same output filename as the lib target `iceoryx2_ffi` in package `iceoryx2-ffi v0.3.0 (C:\Users\ekxide\iceoryx2\iceoryx2-ffi\ffi)`.
> Colliding filename is: C:\Users\ekxide\iceoryx2\target\release\deps\iceoryx2_ffi.lib
> The targets should have unique names.
> Consider changing their names to be unique or compiling them separately.
> This may become a hard error in the future; see <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6313>.

## Workaround

Currently the workaround is to have the integrationtests in the module. This would give access to private API though. To circumvent this problem only `pub(super)` shall be used if an API needs to be available in other modules but not `pub(crate)`. With the following folder structure the tests can again only be written as whitebox tests

Even with `UnableToDeliverStrategy::Block` set, `safe_overflow` disabled and a limited buffer size, a publisher does not always block. For example, it does not block:

- When the publisher process is the first to start with no subscriber process.
- When the last subscriber process is killed before the publisher is done filling the buffer.

The publisher blocks when there is a subscriber present when buffer gets filled. It also **remains blocked** when you remove the last subscriber before it consumes its buffer.

BTW, I made sure `subscriber_max_buffer_size` on publisher side as well.

But I admit it is a bit hidden and not as straight forward as the iceoryx1 API with `Publisher::has_subscribers() -> bool`. The reason is that in iceoryx1 the service was somehow hidden inside the `Publisher` but with iceoryx2 it is an explicit object. And this object can tell you a lot about its state via the `static_config()` and `dynamic_config()` methods.

Another approach we want to implement is, that a service emits events whenever its state (see: `dynamic_config()`) changes. So the sending process could wait until the event was signaled that there are subscribers and then starts publishing.
Today you could also realize this but you have to do this explicitly by creating an event service and send a notification when the process has created a subscriber. Events can have multiple event_ids so you could define your event_id for new subscriber, subscriber disconnected, new publisher, and so on.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6FlAK2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Cool. Will make the API nicer for use cases like this.

To achieve this you have to share a memory-mapped file between windows and the WSL instance - something that already works. The linux pendant requires a data segment implementation that is based on memory-mapped files instead of posix shared memory and then the communication could be established.

The event messaging-pattern could be implemented via UDP between Windows and WSL, and then everything should work.

I think that everything could be implemented in 2 months, but the sad news is that we focus currently on feature requests from our customers like C/C++/python binding, Request-Response and the ROS2 rmw layer and do not have the capacity to realize it yet.

Regarding the need for this feature, we can work around the limitation at this time. For example, instead of using Media Foundation on Windows, we can move that component to WSL 2, forward the camera USB port, and use ffmpeg, or write a proxy on WSL 2 that publishes the data to iceoryx2.

However, our use case is quite complex and this feature would be very helpful.

Our product is an ADAS/AD/CDC system for cars. It would be incredibly useful to have zero-copy pub/sub from different OSs using hypervisor primitives. For now, we can proceed with a single OS, but in the future, it would be more flexible if we could relocate ADAS/AD components to different OSs.

On our roadmap is also exactly this use case. The thing is that the Windows <-> WSL2 communication is realized completely different than a hypervisor communication between for instance QNX <-> Linux, the typical automotive use case.

When a publisher sends samples and removes itself before the subscriber called `Subscriber::receive` then the samples are lost.

**Expected result or behaviour:**
The `Subscriber::receive` call shall return samples until they are no more.

**Details:**
The problem originates in the `update_connections` call in the Subscriber. Whenever receive is called this method is called internally at first.

**Observed result or behaviour:**
The timeout for the concepts DynamicStorage, SharedMemory and ZeroCopyConnection how long to wait until the initialization is finalized is not set in iceoryx2. This can lead to errors of being unable to connect to another port since the resource is still in initialization.

The StaticStorage requires a timeout as well but here it is not yet implemented. Here a service can be detected of being in a corrupted state.

Currently, the initialization of the dynamic storage is handled by setting the permissions to write only during initialization and then adjust them to read/write after the initialization was completed.
But, this approach only works for linux since FreeBSD, MacOs and Windows seem to be unable to adjust the permissions of the shared memory after it was created.

Every posix shared memory based dynamic storage also contains a version number to ensure that non-compatible versions are unable to connect. If the version number is zero it is also regarded as uninitialized. The problem is, that this is undefined behavior but works most of the time since the operating system zero's the memory before providing it to the application.

A cleaner approach would be to use the permissions again. FreeBSD and MacOs use a trampoline file to point to the correct shared memory, due to the name length limitations. Instead of adjusting the shared memory access rights, one could work with the access rights of the trampoline file which would offer a clean solution.
On Windows we could implement a similar approach.

## Details

 * The actual concept is affected by it but does not require change, since the algorithm is correct but the platform does not support the permission initialization strategy.
 * The platform needs to support permission adjustments of shared memory after the shared memory was created.

For extra context I see this occur when I have my subscriber busy looping in debug mode and my publisher sends a singular message and then exits program normally.

If I add a `thread::sleep` to the publisher after sending the dynamic payload (`[u8]`) the subscriber is able to receive the data sent.

Not sure how to deal with this race condition but that seems to be an issue with the subscriber receiving the payload but during that call the publisher cleans up the sent information after being deallocated from the program ending.

In the config I specifically removed node cleanup for construction and destruction of the publisher.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6P0euY/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. Subscriber created
2. Publisher created
3. Publisher sends sample
4. Publisher is removed
5. Subscriber calls receive and receives nothing?

If so then this is something caused by the decentral architecture of iceoryx2. The underlying reason is that the subscriber checks in receive if the service had any updates and if so connects to the new publishers and removes the old ones. But in this case there is nothing to connect since the publisher is gone again.

Currently, we are evaluating multiple approaches to handle this issue. We could add a configurable parameter so that the publisher waits on drop (with a timeout X) until every subscriber has confirmed that it is connected. This would require the subscriber to have a loop that waits for at most X. With the new [WaitSet (Event multiplexing mechanism)]( https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/rust/event_multiplexing) this could be handled elegantly by waking up another process.
There will be an example demonstrating this in the near future.

Thanks for the insight to the issue 💯. I am working with a kind of mpsc (multiple producers single consumer) kind of situation. My current set of solutions (plus the one you gave)

1. Use the event system to wait until the subscriber has received the message and post the event back to the publisher saying it received the content.
2. Use the `WaitSet` solution
3. The future planned request response work should also help with this.

If you have any others to keep an eye on let me know.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6P4csy/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The error message just states that the config file could not be opened, but actually, this is not a problem since the following line states: `Unable to load default config file, populate config with default values.`

When the process is started twice, once with `--pub` and argument and once without so that the subscriber is started, do you observe the `println` with the send sample or not? From the code point of view everything looks fine.

In iceoryx2 we require an event multiplexing mechanism like the iceoryx waitset. It is connected to `Node::wait()`  and maybe integrated into the `Node` or a separate mechanism.

## ToDo List

 * [x] Implement WaitSet
 * [x] C and C++ bindings
 * [ ] Add example how event based communication can look like

## Terms

 * **tick** - periodic event to produce something
 * **timeout** - periodic deadline event to consume something

## API

```rust
impl WaitSetBuilder {
  fn new() -> Self;
  fn allocator(); // sets custom allocator to now allocate management stuff on the heap
  fn tick(CyclicTimer); // sets tick timeout, whenever wait/run shall emit WaitEvent::Tick
  fn create();
}

pub enum Attachment<'a, T: SynchronousMultiplexing> {
  Notification(&'a T),
  Deadline((&'a T, Duration)),
  Tick(Duration),
};

impl WaitSet {
  fn attach<T>(attachment: Attachment);
  fn run(callback); // runs in a timed loop defined by tick
  fn try_run(callback); // no ticks? tries to gather all events.
}
```

## Preconsiderations

### Details

 * `SynchronousMultiplexing` is a trait implemented by every file descriptor based construct where the file descriptor emits events and can be attached to `select`, `poll` or `epoll`
 * Every struct that implements `SynchronousMultiplexing` shall be attachable
   * Enables the user to implement the trait for sockets and attach them
 * A `Listener` port shall be attachable.
 * `Listener` ports from different `Node`s shall be attachable.
   * When the app acts as a gateway between 2 isolated iceoryx2 domains the gateway shall wake up whenever it receives a message from one of the domains without requiring multiple threads
 * `Node` knows all ports, the first idea was to handle background tasks like `Publisher::update_connections()` in `Node::wait()` to deliver the history to newly connected `Subscriber`s
 * `Publisher::update_connections()` problem, how is the `Subscriber`s history delivered?
   * can be handled with cyclic `Node::wait(CYCLE_TIME)` when the node calls it explicitly for every port - can cause a latency up to `CYCLE_TIME`
   * can be handled explicitly by the user - can be error prone when the user has to call this for every publisher
   * Combine pubsub service with event service with the same name.
     * specify and reserve an `IOX2_SERVICE_UPDATE` id and emit this whenever a `Subscriber` did connect to a service
     * `Node::wait()` fetches event internally and calls `update_connections()` explicitly
     * requires the user to create the event, attach it and to emit the `IOX2_SERVICE_UPDATE` event
* The `WaitSet` shall emit signals to handle CTRL+c, SIGINT, SIGTERM events in the same call as additional events
* `WaitSet` shall provide 3 variants: `try_wait`, `timed_wait`, `blocking_wait` 

### Results
 1. `Node::wait()` is obsolete?
 2. Create `WaitsetBuilder` and provide optionally allocator for custom dynamic memory, otherwise use heap
 3. `Waitset::attach_fn()` must, `Waitset::attach()`
 4. Aim for
 ```rust
while event = waitset::wait() {
  event.call(); // call callback set with `attach_fn()`.
}
```
5. Is independent of the node!","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/390/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

## Improvement Suggestion

So by default the log-level shall be increased to warn and the `set_log_level` API be exported to become public iceoryx2 API so that a user can go into log-level trace when it is required.

Having interoperability between 32-bit and 64-bit applications would help porting legacy application to 64-bit by opening the path to port one application at a time and keep the system running.

Additionally, there are SoCs with 32-bit realtime cores and 64-bit performance cores. An interoperability between 32-bit and 64-bit application is a precondition for zero-copy between those cores.

The goal is to get iceoryx2 running on the [Kria KR260 Robotics Starter Kit](https://www.amd.com/en/products/system-on-modules/kria/k26/kr260-robotics-starter-kit.html)

## Detailed information

Due to differences in the alignment of 64-bit PODs on 32-bit architectures compared to 64-bit architectures, it must be ensured that all data structures have the same data layout. With C++ and GCC this can be done via the `-malign-double` flag, which ensures that the alignment of 64-bit PODs on 32-bit architectures matches the alignment of the 64-bit architectures.

If Rust does not support such a compiler flag, all 64-bit data structures must have an explicit alignment to 8 bytes.

Additionally, POSIX data structures like ´sem_t´ have a different size on 32-bit than on 64-bit. These structures cannot be used in shared memory and need an replacement. On Linux, a futex based solution can be used and on Windows a similar approach with `WaitOnAddress` is feasible. Operating systems which do not support such a mechanism, can either use a spin based solution or a completely different concept which does not rely on such a data structure being placed into the shared memory.

Hmm, this is a tough problem to solve - something I completely overlooked when imagining this feature, my mistake.

As a first step, I guess the CLI could be made to only use [the `[u8]` payload type](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/examples/rust/publish_subscribe_dynamic_data/publisher.rs#L23) so that concrete types aren't needed. We are currently working on updating `iceoryx2` so that the [`maximum_slice_len`](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/examples/rust/publish_subscribe_dynamic_data/publisher.rs#L29) does not need to be provided when defining services of type `[u8]`. This however would mean that applications would also need to use the `[u8]` payload type for the CLI to connect to it, which is not ideal for many reasons (usability, safety, etc.). Proceeding with this first though would allow for focusing on the other (maybe simpler) aspects of implementing the CLI.

To get the CLI to work with services with [concrete types](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/examples/rust/publish_subscribe/publisher.rs#L25), two ideas come to mind (but I think they might definitely need some more thought):

1. Add functionality for `iceoryx2` applications to compile type definitions into a separate shared library
    1. The CLI would need to have a way to find these libraries to get the type definitions
        1. Ideally this would be automatic, but could be done manually by passing an argument as a stepping stone
1. Use something like [`schemars`](https://crates.io/crates/schemars) (and `serde`?) to store type descriptions along with services?
    1. Not sure how feasible it is, but could also be an interesting option
    2. Not sure if this removes the requirement of using `[u8]` payload types though

Let me know if you have any other ideas. I am not yet super confident that one of these two options would be optimal. Might need some discussion before we work out what makes the most sense.

> Can I get the size of this payload and create a new service with this payload size at runtime?

Until we remove the `max_slice_len` requirement, you could maybe just make the size the actual size of the payload.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6UoLPa/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

And here some constructive help for your challenge.

First of all, you have to acquire the type details for the payload and the user header that are stored in the static service details of the service. To do this, you first need to acquire the static service details with:

```rust
let details = ipc::Service::details(
    &""My/Funk/ServiceName"".try_into()?,
    Config::global_config(),
    MessagingPattern::PublishSubscribe,
).unwrap().unwrap();
```

When you have it you need to extract the static details for publish subscribe
```rust
let user_header;
let payload;
if let iceoryx2::service::static_config::messaging_pattern::MessagingPattern::PublishSubscribe(
    config,
) = details.static_details.messaging_pattern()
{
    user_header = config.message_type_details().user_header.clone();
    payload = config.message_type_details().payload.clone();

    println!(""user header: {:?}"", user_header);
    println!(""payload: {:?}"", payload);
} else {
    panic!()
}
```

With those details you can now define a service with custom type details. This is not safe since you could mix things up here and induce undefined behavior or a crash in another application. It is also internal API, but we use the same approach for our internal tooling so I think the CLI can be an exception too. To be able to override the payload and user header type details you need to define the `[CustomPayloadMarker]` as payload type and `CustomHeaderMarker` as user header type.

```rust
use iceoryx2::service::builder::publish_subscribe::{CustomHeaderMarker, CustomPayloadMarker};

let expert_service = unsafe {
    node.service_builder(&""My/Funk/ServiceName"".try_into()?)
        .publish_subscribe::<[CustomPayloadMarker]>()
        .user_header::<CustomHeaderMarker>()
        .__internal_set_payload_type_details(&payload)
        .__internal_set_user_header_type_details(&user_header)
        .open()
        .unwrap();
};
```

The subscriber and the publisher port now behave like if they would have been created with `[u8]` payload type and you are able to send and receive any arbitrary data.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6UxKR7/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

> How can I write my data into my payload and send it ?

When you call `loan_custom_payload(N)` you get `N` times the size of the `payload`. So assume your payload has a size of 4 and `N` is 2 you get 8 bytes since it is handled like a slice.

Let's assume your data type is `Fuu` you could write the data like:
```rust
unsafe { (sample.payload_mut()[0].as_mut_ptr() as *mut Fuu).write(Fuu::new()) };
```

If you want to write arbitrary bytes into it that were provided as arguments from the console you can do it like:
```rust
for n in 0..payload.size { // unsure if it is really payload.size, but you require the type size of the payload
  unsafe { (sample.payload_mut()[n].as_mut_ptr() as *mut u8).write(123) };
}

Those failures are not a problem. `[T]` = trace log output, `[D]` debug, `[I]` info, `[W]` warning, `[E]` error, `[F]` fatal last log output before a crash.

In this case it just means that a specific shared memory could not be opened but iceoryx2 could handle it by creating it and then open it.
`[D]` is always emitted when a function returns a `Result` with an error.

For the user only are only warnings and errors interesting. Just add
```rust
set_log_level(LogLevel::Warn);
```
at the top of your program and the log messages vanishes.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6WT6ys/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For completion, the idea I was considering was supporting functionality similar to what is available in ROS 2 (as in example [found here](https://roboticsbackend.com/ros2-topic-cmd-line-tool-debug-ros2-topics-from-the-terminal/#ros2_topic_pub_%E2%80%93_Publish_to_a_topic_from_the_terminal)):

```
$ ros2 topic pub -r 10 /greetings example_interfaces/msg/String ""{data: 'Hello from terminal'}""
publisher: beginning loop
publishing #1: example_interfaces.msg.String(data='Hello from terminal')

publishing #2: example_interfaces.msg.String(data='Hello from terminal')

...
```

This is the direction I was thinking in with my [previous comment](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/413#issuecomment-2493559770). The benefit of this is that it could open up avenues for users to quickly interact with a running system from the CLI. The scenario I have in mind is a developer plugging their laptop into the running system for debugging / testing.

This functionality is more complex to implement than sending the (unchecked) hex bytes though, since the CLI would need a way to find the message definition.

I am not extremely familiar with that corner of the code base, but at a high level, I think something like the following would be required (needs to be verified):

1. Add functionality to the `ShmAllocator` trait to track usage in addition to their capacity
    1. Thread-safety needs to be considered here, an atomic for the usage metric should be sufficient I think
    2. Maintaining the usage metric would also add (small) overhead, so maybe it should also be behind an opt-in feature flag or something to allow users to choose to run with or without this additional overhead
4. Add functionality to the `DynamicStorage` trait to retrieve this usage and capacity via the used `ShmAllocator`
5. Add functionality to `ServiceState` and `NodeState` structs to retrieve the usage and capacity of the underlying `DynamicStorage` used for their data
    1. It should be possible for a process accessing the states with read-only access to see the metrics so they would need to be stored in the storage somehow

Then in the CLI:

1. List all services/nodes
2. Retrieve their capacity and usage
3. Pretty print these metrics per-service, maybe also % usage (e.g. `iox2 memory show —services`)
3. Pretty print these metrics per-node, maybe also % usage (e.g. `iox2 memory show —nodes`)
5. Optional: Pretty print the total memory capacity reserved for iceoryx2 and the usage (e.g. `iox2 memory show —total`)
6. Print all 3-5 if no flags specified (e.g. `iox2 memory show`)
7. Optional: If you are feeling adventurous, launching a terminal ui (e.g. with `iox2 memory watch`) to monitor this live could be cool

If you have different ideas feel free to take some creative liberties. Also, you don‘t need to do everything at once, could start with e.g. only showing memory used by services.

> significant increase in user base

I agree. We wish to work on this, but the core team is currently working on other customer-accelerated features like Python support, request-response, and blackboard pattern. 

> please let us know how to help accelerate timeline

Please look at the bottom of the main readme if you would like to have a contact to accelerate this feature as well.

Things that would help us as well would be documentation on how to set up a development environment with Rust for Android, with iceoryx2 as an example. This would provide us with the perfect starting point to start directly with the implementation. The lowest building blocks of iceoryx2 should already be compatible with android `iceoryx2-pal-concurrency-sync`.

>  (presuming the zero copy semantics maintained / better than binderfs)

Yes, zero-copy semantics would be maintained but it takes more effort than a platform like windows due to the sandbox nature of android. iceoryx2 requires direct access to lower system resources like shared memory, things which seem not be feasible with android - but I am not an android expert. See: https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/memory#group___memory_1ga5bbfa70e48fcbc488a8cb8fa7657c878

Normally, multiple processes would open a shared memory with the same name, on android one process creates the shared memory and shares this shared memory via binder with the other processes. As soon as everyone has the shared memory handle, zero copy communication can start. So to get android running, we need to implement and add this as a subsystem to iceoryx2.

A port of iceoryx2 would have essentially two milestones:
1. it compiles on android and iceoryx2 can be used for intra-process communication
2. binder integration and iceoryx2 can be used for inter-process communication

iceoryx2 also provides a special optimization for intra-process. When you create a node like

```rust
let node = NodeBuilder::new().create<local::Service>()?; // local::Service instead of ipc::Service
```

then you use the process local optimized variant.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6eiqZ9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The two targets aren't currently supported since I'm taking a conservative approach since every platform has its own set of details for shared libraries.

If you have experience with any of those platform target I'd welcome a pull request to add the necessary informations:
- if the platform uses soname to embed the library version in the library (common on unix-like elf systems)
- which is library naming convention (e.g. `lib{name}.so` vs `name.dll`, symlinks over version minor/major)

For people with access to the platform it would take 10 minutes to prepare the patch. `eMCOS` isn't currently even present in the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html) so I guess its addition is very recent.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6SO46U/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Enable communication using `iceoryx2` in Python applications.

## Detailed information

A couple of options have been briefly investigated:

1. [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
    1. Allows for annotating Rust functions and structs to be made available via a Python module
    2. Good overview on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyG6AKzu4ew
3. [Extending using C/C++ Bindings](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html)
    1. Allows for more control over the implementation
    2. However, requires more boilerplate
    4. It is not obvious if the extra effort warrants the benefit

The PyO3 option seems more maintainable and less effort to me.

**Other considerations:**

1. Loose coupling to `iceoryx2` internals
    1. The implementation should not modify `iceoryx2` API or its internals to work

Currently, we have some deadlines we have to meet until the 14th of October with the #424 and some other iceoryx2 infrastructure stuff.

After this, we wanted to slowly focus on the request-response messaging pattern. The implementation is rather complex and would require some longer onboarding with internal design documents (we still have to write), but what could help would be to write either some examples in Rust/C/C++ and documentation for the best practices around request response or to write unit tests.

If you are still interested, I will ping you as soon as we start with it, but it will most likely be at some point in November.

In the meantime, if you would like to support, I cleaned up the open issues and updated the good first issue label - so if you like you can grab one of those: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22

Btw. we have here our chat: https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#eclipse_iceoryx:gitter.im if you need direct support from the community.

Many comments violate the [first doc comment paragraph is too long](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#/too_long_first_doc_paragraph) rules because they don't have a short and brief introduction as the first doc comment.

I plan to fix them gradually, on the way of learning and understanding more about iceoryx2 codebase. Moreover, I will try to put the doc fixing in separated PRs for better reviewing(it may take efforts for reviewing because of the in-accurate statements).

The file `iceoryx2-bb/posix/src/system_configuration.rs` provides the interface to the configuration of all system resources and a `print_system_configuration()` function to show them. Now, since `iox2` is finally here, we should remove the function `print_system_configuration()` and move it into an `iox2-config` command to show the config from the command line.

1. Make a binary called `iox2-config` in the crate `iceoryx2-cli`

If you do not want to perform a busy wait, you can combine the publish-subscribe service with an event service and fire an event after the publisher has sent the message. On the subscriber side you wait on a listener until you have received the event and then receive your sample on the subscriber. For the event you can find an example here: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/rust/event","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6OswgS/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It's still much slower than these numbers so I'll have to continue investigation

With one of them you have a huge performance impact @elBoberido knows more here.
We encountered the same problem in our benchmarks and the solution was, instead of sending one sample and measure the time from A to B, we use a setup where process A sends a sample to process B and as soon as process B has received it, we send a sample back to A. We repeat this a million times and then measure the total time divided by the repetition times 2 (since we send the sample back and forth).

Yes, our benchmarks are part of the repo and you can run them yourself: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/benchmarks

 * `cargo run --bin benchmark-publish-subscribe --release -- --bench-all` runs a ping-pong style pub-sub benchmark with two busy spin loops
 * `cargo run --bin benchmark-event --release -- --bench-all` runs a ping-pong style event benchmark with two loop waiting for a notification. Here the threads perform under the hood a sys call to wait for the notification to arrive and then fire a response.

You could divide the parameter tuning into to fields: deployment and iceoryx2.

* For the deployment we used the posix thread feature to pin a thread to a specific CPU core and add a high priority which reduces jittering from your OS.

* For iceoryx2 it is essentially, the less the better (at least for most parameter). If you have a setup with 1 publisher and 1000 subscribers, the latency will go up - this goes also for other parameters like history size. In the future, we need to provide a benchmark for such a setups as well, but the first benchmark focuses on a minimal use case with one publisher and one subscriber. I expect only a few nanoseconds when you increase these numbers significantly - but this needs to be proven by a benchmark.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6PrtSJ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

FAQ
I've seen the 'dynamically sized' portion of the FAQ. This is not about the ability to transmit variably sized data types. This issue is about how badly iceoryx handles dynamically sized data.
Ideally this would be prevented at compile time, but at minimum the program should respond to SIGKILL/SIGTERM and should probably crash when failing to handle dynamically sized data, rather than spinning at 100% core usage.

You cannot send a `String` with iceoryx2. The reason is that a `String` uses heap memory and contains a pointer. iceoryx2 supports only self-contained data types.
We already provide some containers that are shared memory compatible, in your case, take a look at the complex data types example: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/rust/complex_data_types

Here, we demonstrate how to use a `FixedSizeByteString` and a `FixedSizeByteString` as payload data.

With v0.5 we will introduce a macro that prevents users from using incompatible types. Also, we will add this to the documentation so that no one else will run into this issue before v0.5!

Just btw, on early reflection (and I haven't spent much time on it yet) I don't think a macro should be needed for the safety I'm describing.
I think it would be simpler (and more 'Rust') to provide a trait like `SelfContained` and implement it for all primitives and maybe even `Copy` types. Whatever is happening during the serialization / copying into shared memory step is not working for heap data and this is likely `unsafe`.

I added the type restrictions and how to define payload types for iceoryx to all example documentations and the FAQ. Furthermore, with #448 the signal handling should now be correct - so if you let your `String` example run again, the subscriber should terminate when the `SIGSEGV` is received.

Yes, this was our idea. To have a proc macro with a corresponding trait like `SelfContained` or `ShmSend` which is implemented for all primitive types. So you just have to annotate your struct with `#[ShmSend]` and if one member does not implement the trait you get a compile failure.

> Whatever is happening during the serialization / copying into shared memory step is not working for heap data and this is likely unsafe.

One of the benefits of zero copy communication is that you do not need to serialize the data at all. You can use the API so that you do not need to perform a single copy. The workflow should be like acquire memory with `Publisher::loan()` provide this memory to your thing that produces data - for instance V4L2 API has a call so that the camera writes the frame directly into the provided memory - and then you send it out to the next process.
So you do not have a single copy in this pipeline and then iceoryx2 becomes incredibly fast.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6O3f37/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I proposed to add a check in `iceoryx2-pal/posix/build.rs` to check whether the `clang` is installed, if not, let the `build.rs` suggests users to install it. Or at least it reports some warnings so I can aware that I need to find the `stddef.h` by myself and set up it the bindgen builder:
```diff
            bindgen::Builder::default()
                .header(""src/c/posix.h"")
+               .clang_arg(""-I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include"")

                .generate()

How do you think about it? This should be an document issue for us to improve.

Sure, i think this is a good idea and let me help to create a PR for it. Besides, I cannot install `clang` in my ubuntu as the dependencies are messy now and i don't want to tackle them at all.

For me, adding a `clang_arg` call is enough, but it's of course rediculous to merge the path which only makes sense in my own desktop. Hence, I proposed we support an env var `ICEORYX2_CLANG_ARG` in `build.rs` to do so.

In https://iceoryx2.readthedocs.io and also our examples we need to clearly define the restrictions on the payload type. On the Rust side we can solve this cleanly with the `shmem` derive macro but on the C/C++ side we must document it. 

It already led to a bug; see #436, so this shall be done sooner rather than later. Otherwise, another user will also run into this pitfall.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/446/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I came across [this reply](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41690606) from @elBoberido on HN and it's emblematic of what's lacking; the parent talks about shared memory challenges in the presence of process death and the response simply states
> We found a few ways on how to make this feasible, though.

Another point of confusion for me: how does this work without a central broker? According to https://iceoryx.io/ there is no need for one.

Anyway, something that describes the design of the software would go a long way in increasing (at least my) confidence in it.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/450/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Just to give you some context, we have all been working together for the last seven years. Starting with a Bosch research project, the predecessor of iceoryx, then we fought for over a year to make it open source. In the last years, we have certified parts of iceoryx1 according to ISO 26262 and realized that some things make the zero-copy communication hard to certify - one key element was the central broker.

We started redesigning iceoryx again and came up with the iceoryx2 architecture. It just took us five years to realize that everyone has a central broker - it is the operating system. So we founded ekxide to realize the next generation of iceoryx.

At the moment we have the goal to reach feature parity with iceoryx and complete the user documentation with a good getting started guide. When this is done, we will present the iceoryx2 design in detail. Maybe it would be a great topic for a FOSDEM 2025 talk but I think we need a bit more than just one hour.

Just out of curiosity, what topic would you be most interested in:
 * Architecture without a central daemon
 * Decentralized process monitoring and resource cleanup
 * Decentralized communication and service discovery
 * Zero trust approach for shared memory communication
 * Indestructible processes
 * Incorruptible data structures","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6O7Ish/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Some tips:
* PATH now contains the SDK utilities
* Standard autotools variables (CC, LD, CFLAGS) are exported
* Kernel compilation variables (ARCH, CROSS_COMPILE, KERNELDIR) are exported
* To configure do ""./configure $CONFIGURE_FLAGS"" or use
  the ""configure"" alias
* To build CMake-based projects, use the ""cmake"" alias

Another small issue, when I run `make install`, it only copy` libiceoryx2_cxx.so、libiceoryx2_ffi.so`  to the install folder. But when I run the example, it need `libiceoryx_platform.so and libiceoryx_hoofs.so`, these libs are left in `build\_deps\iceoryx-build\iceoryx_platform`, so I need to copy them by myself.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6SGQ3Y/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It is actually two separate issues.

The cause is `event_listener.blocking_wait_one()` in the `listener.rs`. When you press CTRL+c you send a SIGINT/SIGTERM signal and cause the application to abnormally terminate since no signal handler was registered and then also the resources of the process are not cleaned up.

If you adjust the code to this, the termination signal should be handled cleanly.

```rust
// you need to add iceoryx2-bb-posix as dependency into your Cargo.toml
use iceoryx2_bb_posix::signal::*;

// ...

while !SignalHandler::termination_requested() {
    match event_listener.blocking_wait_one() {
        Ok(Some(id)) => println!(""woke up {id:?}""),
        Ok(None) => (),
        Err(_) => break,
    }
}
```

So whenever you have a blocking call you need to register some kind of signal handler so that the application can cleanly terminate when CTRL+c is pressed.

Another issue is, that we have introduced with v0.4. a stale resource cleanup when a node crashes or does not cleanup the resources. Then another node takes over and cleans the resources.
On Linux it is working and you see something like:
```
        6 [W] ""Node::<iceoryx2::service::ipc::Service>::cleanup_dead_nodes()""
              | Dead node (NodeId(UniqueSystemId { value: 1667667095615766886193595845
              | , pid: 34245, creation_time: Time { clock_type: Realtime, seconds: 172
              | 8553806, nanoseconds: 90404414 } })) detected
```
In your case this should happen as well but it seems there is a problem on Windows.

In the case that a node gets stuck due to this OpenFileMapping error, what can we do to clean up stale resources (other than manually removing files in `C:\Temp\`)?

Shared Memory is not persistent in Windows. Whenever the last process that holds a shared memory handle terminates or crashes Windows removes the memory-mapped file from the file system. When a new process starts, it detects that there seems to exist the service but the dynamic segment of the service is missing - since the last process holding it crashed. So, it is correctly identified as corrupted, and the cleanup aborts here.
I will adjust the code so that corrupted services are also removed, which should solve the Windows issue.

I'm not sure why we use this approach to calculate layout(probably to keep the same with iceoryx in c++). I found we can rely on rust to calculate the layout as if we define a structure for the whole sample. Hence, `sample_layout_genric::<i32, bool, i64>(2)` works as if we define a structure `S1`:
```rust
        #[repr(C)]
        struct S1 {
            _a: i32,
            _user_header: bool,
            _layout: [i64; 2],
        }
```

The sample_layout_genric is shown below:

```rust
    pub(crate) fn sample_layout_genric<Header, UserHeader, Payload>(&self, n: usize) -> Layout {
        let layout_header = Layout::new::<Header>();
        let layout_user_header = Layout::new::<UserHeader>();
        let layout_array = Layout::array::<Payload>(n).ok().unwrap();
        layout_header
            .extend(layout_user_header)
            .ok()
            .unwrap()
            .0
            .extend(layout_array)
            .ok()
            .unwrap()
            .0
            .pad_to_align()
    }
```

I have the committed the [change](https://github.com/xieyuschen/iceoryx2/commit/d40956c02283626f9cdc6913bc77c39d9f5f373a) for you to check in my forked repo.

Do you think it's a better solution comparing with current one? Note that I don't know whether we have the compatible concerns, so please let me know if the underlying layout calculation is crucial.

Acked. The calculated layouts are different between the current approach and my proposal, so that's probably a concern for the compatibility issue. I will try to revise the existing code for the project to test, so we can know more about this approach when you dive into it next week.

When deploying iceoryx2 in a docker environment with inconsistent user setup, meaning that every docker container and the host are using a contradicting `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` then the default permissions prevent that a connection can be established between them.

To solve this, a flag `development-permissions` will be introduced. It will grant read-and-write access to every process, with the downside that this raises some security concerns since every process can modify the underlying resources. But this can be helpful during development when the permissions and final setup are not yet clear.

Currently, the `iceoryx2_bb_elementary::PackageVersion` uses the env variables `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_{MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH}` to acquire the crate version. This is essential, since this number is also stored in every shared memory construct to prevent a communication between incompatible iceoryx2 versions. Sadly, those env variables are not set by Bazel and depend on the deployed environment that does not have to be cargo.

However, the C++ side uses `typeid().name`, whose format is undefined and left to the compiler. Acoording to [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4465872/why-does-typeid-name-return-weird-characters-using-gcc-and-how-to-make-it-prin), on GCC/Clang it's the mangled name, while on MSVC it's the demangled name. So the type name is not only different from Rust and C++, but also different from GCC/Clang and MSVC.

Unfortunately, looks like there is currently no way in iceoryx2 to customize the type name.

### 1(fixed): bindgen issue

The issue is propably caused by incorrect release downloading.
```
/bin/bash: external/bindgen/bindgen: cannot execute binary file

My publisher sends messages at a frequency of 1000Hz.
I added an array of 1M to the test structure (path: examples/cxx/publish_subscribe/src/transmission_data.hpp).
`struct TransmissionData {`
`    std::int32_t x;`
`    std::int32_t y;`
`    double funky;`
`    char c[1024*1024];`
`}`
I found that the efficiency of the program is affected by the size of the array.
By default, when the max_slice_len interface is not called, the CPU usage will increase from 3% to 35% when the array is larger than 1M.

Now I know that the publisher needs to call this interface: max_slice_len(uint64_t).
`auto publisher = service.publisher_builder()`
`    .max_slice_len(1024 * 1024 + 100)`
`    .create();`

Please do not use `max_slice_len` in this case. It is an API-Bug on our side that this is available for non-`iox::Slice` types. The idea behind this call is that you can define the length of the dynamic array you want to handle - we call in this case slice.

Translated to your use case, it would mean if your construct the service with a payload of `iox::Slice<TransmissionData>` to have a dynamic array of `TransmissionData` elements.

```cxx
auto service = node.service_builder(ServiceName::create(""Service With Dynamic Data"")
                   .publish_subscribe<iox::Slice<TransmissionData>>()
                   .open_or_create()
                   .expect(""successful service creation/opening"");
```

But this is not want you want in your use case!

When `TransmissionData` has a size of ~ 1MB and you allocate it with `publisher.loan()` then the whole 1MB is always initialized, meaning that all elements of `TransmissionData::c` are zeroed which is very CPU demanding. 
This is why we offer `publisher.loan_uninit()`. It returns you uninitialized memory and the CPU usage should be decreased.

The summary:

* `publisher.loan()` is best for:
   * small data
   * data that must be initialized before using it
* `publisher.loan_uninitialized` is best for:
   * large data (roughly > 4kb)
   * data that is initialized explicitly by the user

Thank you very much for your explanation.
To add, I did the test on ARM hardware.
But I always used the loan_uninit interface. 
After my test, I found that the high CPU usage was caused by calling the interface ""sample.write_payload"". After commenting this line of code, although the data received by the subscriber is 0, the CPU usage will be very low.

I'll post my test code.

Memory read/write operations are always expensive this is why we try do reduce them as much as possible and use zero-copy communication in the first place.

But you can optimize it further by reducing the memory write operations. `sample.write_payload(...)` creates a new `TransmissionData` instance and copies this in the shared memory which is maybe unnecessary when not all member need to be initialized.
Let's assume you only need to initialize `x`, `y`, and the first 100 elements of `c`. You can do this explicitly and leave the rest uninitialized which saves you a lot of memory write operations.

```cxx
auto sample = publisher.loan_uninit().expect(""acquire sample"");

Since the `WaitSet` must support file descriptors, the event messaging pattern must be based on file descriptors. Currently, the process local variant uses non-process local unix datagram sockets which violate the process local contract.

This can be solved by creating an abstraction for `socketpair()` and implementing an event concept on them so that it can be used in process local services.

Also, iceoryx2 is already ported to mac os, which should make things much simpler. So the work that has to be done is maybe less than we think. However, the apps are usually sandboxed, which means that we do not have direct access to the system's underlying shared memory, which is essential for zero-copy communication. We can handle this by extending the architecture of iceoryx2, something that is already planned independent of iOS or Android.

What we essentially require is that there is a process that owns the service. Every participant uses unix-domain sockets to register at this process, and this process then sends the services corresponding shared memory file-descriptors via unix-domain sockets to the participants. 

But when your use-case is:

Not yet but the only thing we need to add is an iceoryx2 ""sandbox"" mode. This will be a rust feature flag that disables all IPC dependencies and would make it much easier to port iceoryx2 to another OS. When this is introduced the `libproc.h` problem may vanish completely since it is no longer used.

> I have successfully used Rust crates from C#/Unity via csbindgen FFI and NativeArrays.

We already use cbindgen for the C language bindings and build on top a C++ abstraction so that C++ and Rust users have a similar and comfortable API. Would this also be a valid approach for C#? I assume you would just create bindings for the low-level iceoryx2-ffi API which is pretty cumbersome to use.


With the sandbox approach, we should be able to quickly port iceoryx2 to iOS. I would start with the sandbox flag in December, and maybe we can have iOS support in January.

> If I build two applications with two different versions of each other, should I expect them to be able to communicate with each other, assuming one isn't using a new feature not supported by the other?

Currently, all processes must use the same iceoryx2 version. For instance, a publisher built with iceoryx2 v0.3 will be incompatible with a subscriber built with iceoryx2 v0.4 and will report an incompatibility error. However, in the future, we plan to decouple the iceoryx2 version from its protocol version.

In the future, we will introduce an iceoryx2 protocol version number so that the iceoryx2 version is not strictly coupled to the protocol version. Here the idea is that the protocol itself is specified in detail so that in theory another 3rd party client could follow the specification and be able to participate in the communication. Also an iceoryx2 version could then be compiled with a specific iceoryx2 protocol version.

> If so, will you ever make breaking changes and how will these correspond with release version numbers?

Until we have reached v1.0 there will be breaking changes and I think afterwards, there may still be breaking changes with new protocol version but this will be unlikely. But just for some context, even though we did not yet have reached v1.0 the pub/sub pattern is pretty much stable since some key design elements originated from iceoryx1 which are very well proven in use.

## The Protocol

It will contain the structure of the underlying communication mechanisms and how they are structured in memory. Additionally, we will write an iceoryx2 independent test suite that verifies the correctness of the iceoryx2 protocol inside iceoryx2. This also will identify breaking changes between versions if they ever happen.
Additionally, the protocol will contain the definition of data types like a vector or a string. The idea is that when using shared-memory you do not need payload serialization at all and since it is memory and CPU intensive we should also strive to avoid it at all costs. Therefore, we provide shared-memory compatible data types like `Vec`, `ByteString` (Rust) or `iox::vector` and `iox::string` (C++). Those data types have a language idiomatic interface but the underlying data structure will be memory-compatible with each other.

Meaning
```rust
// rust
#[derive(ShmSend)]
struct MyDataType {
  data_1: FixedSizeVec<u64, 1024>,
  data_2: FixedSizeByteString<128>
  data_3: RelocatableVec<uint64_t>,
}
```
and 
```cxx
// C++
struct MyDataType {
  iox::fixed_size_vector<uint64_t, 1024> data_1;
  iox::fixed_size_byte_string<128> data_2;
  iox::relocatable_vector<uint64_t> data_3;
};
```
are in memory identical and can be received, send, modified by C++ and Rust.

## Long-term support

We at ([ekxide.io](https://ekxide.io), contact (info@ekxide.io)) pursue an open-core business strategy. To address the problem of long-term compatibility and bug fixes, we also offer that a specific iceoryx2 version will get support from us, even when the open-source support has ended. This means it will run in our internal CI, bug-fixes are back-ported as well as features (when feasible).

- A C library would presumably add a system dependency which would be an extra thing to manage anywhere these services are deployed. Adds an extra opportunity for version incompatibility.
- We heavily use [nix](https://nixos.org/) which is really good at making sure every package gets the right dependency versions, but also means there isn't one system version to link against. On the plus side it makes it easier to ensure multiple packages build with the same version of the library, but this doesn't work as well for native Rust projects that might have Cargo.lock pinned to different versions or for a complicated project I have to build outside of nix for now that bundles its own dependencies.
- C libraries add build complexity to Rust projects and may make cross compilation etc. more difficult

This exactly what is happening with iceoryx2 under the hood. Also, you do not need serialization when using zero-copy communication. We already provide containers that are shared-memory compatible, see this example that introduces the `FixedSize{String|Vec}` https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/examples/rust/complex_data_types/complex_data_types.rs

When a publisher delivers a message to a subscriber, it iterates over a vector and copies a pointer (8 byte) into the receiver buffer of the subscriber. I am a bit skeptical if a filter on the publisher side is more efficient than on the subscriber side - maybe it is even slower. The reason might be that the publisher always has to check the filter for all subscribers, but on the subscriber's side, you only need to activate it when you explicitly need it. 

However, when you combine this with events and wake up the other process/thread just so that it can filter out the sample, then it will cost you a lot of performance.

> Yes, in DDS, it is implemented by identifying the recipient's PID in transmit process, rather than filtering only at the time of subscription. I think this approach is more efficient.

For cyclone dds for instance I know the details. It is far more efficient since it than utilizes a zero-copy behavior where just a pointer to the payload is shared (the are using classic iceoryx for this). This is far more efficient but this is how zero-copy works so such kind of optimizations will maybe gain you nothing when you already use a zero-copy framework.

### zero-copy communication in iceoryx2

Here is a brief overview how zero-copy in iceoryx2 works:

1. `Publisher::loan()`&`Publisher::loan_uninit()` provides memory that is shared between processes. The returned sample is you payload and is written directly inside the shared memory. If you have a data producing function, the best way to utilize zero-copy is to provide a data pointer into the producing function and produce the data directly in shared memory.
2. `Publisher::send()` iterates over the list of all `Subscribers` and copies a relative pointer to the shared memory of 8 bytes into the `Subscribers` receiver buffer.
3. `Subscriber::receive()` copies out the 8 bytes of relative pointer and translates the relative pointer into a process local absolute pointer (it is just a simply addition (relative pointer value + shared memory start address)
4. `Sample::payload()` dereferences the absolut pointer and you have access directly to the memory you have written in step 1.

Since both applications share the actual memory you do not need serialization if your data types are shared memory compatible.

### network communication

Here is a comparison to network communication - I marked the (**high runtime cost**). I ignore here the serialization/deserialization steps (that are additional huge bottlenecks) and just assume we want to transmit something like an array of `uint8_t`.

1. `Send` copies the actual data into the buffer of every subscriber (**high runtime cost**). The larger the data is, the longer it takes. The more subscribers you have, the longer it takes. Additionally, you have to use syscalls here to establish the socket based communication (**high runtime cost**) - meaning the OS will interfere. - In iceoryx2 this is not the case since our pubsub communication works without syscalls and is handled completely with lock-free queues and shared memory -.
2. `Receive` on subscriber side will copy the data out of the buffer and into the user space (**high runtime cost**), which again takes time and costs a lot of memory. And every subscriber has to do this. So an optimization that ignores local subscribers absolutely makes sense! So you share only the data pointer with the subscriber, like iceoryx2 by default does.

### Summary

1. For network communication, you have at least 2 additional copies, from publisher to subscriber buffer and from subscriber buffer to user space - and this ignores the overhead of serialization
2. For network communication, you have to utilize sys-calls that cause OS interference and context-switches
3. In iceoryx2, the pubsub communication does not require sys-calls at all
4. Zero-copy communication produces data only once and then distributes a pointer to all recipients. So no additional copies at all!

So my recommendation would be to look into the complex data types example since I think the biggest performance gain can be made by getting rid of serialization. Additionally, check if you utilize the iceoryx2 API efficiently by using `Publisher::loan_uninit()` and by producing your data directly into shared memory you can access via `SampleMut::payload_mut()`. I think the overhead of checking the publisher id on the subscriber side is in the single-digit nanoseconds.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6U12VS/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If you want to know how expensive even a single copy is you can use our benchmark that comes with a `--send-copy` option.

With copy and a payload size of 40960 bytes:

```sh
cargo run --bin benchmark-publish-subscribe --release -- --bench-all -p 40960 --send-copy
# iceoryx2::service::ipc::Service ::: Iterations: 10000000, Time: 9.739591612, Latency: 486 ns, Sample Size: 40960
```

Without copy:

```sh
cargo run --bin benchmark-publish-subscribe --release -- --bench-all -p 40960 --send-copy
# iceoryx2::service::ipc::Service ::: Iterations: 10000000, Time: 2.7868404509999998, Latency: 139 ns, Sample Size: 40960
```

I measured both things on my laptop. So a unnecessary copy of 40kb increases the latency by a factor of 4.

const CYCLE_TIME: Duration = Duration::from_secs(1);

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let stop = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
    signal_hook::flag::register(signal_hook::consts::SIGINT, Arc::clone(&stop))?;
    signal_hook::flag::register(signal_hook::consts::SIGTERM, Arc::clone(&stop))?;

    let node = NodeBuilder::new().create::<ipc::Service>()?;
    let service = node
        .service_builder(&""My/Funk/ServiceName"".try_into()?)
        .publish_subscribe::<u64>()
        .open_or_create()?;

The benchmark consists in sampling repeatedly the time spent between the publish and the corresponding event notification on the consumer, running in two different processes (not two different threads of the same process). The iceoryx1 test uses WaitSet. After having studied the new examples of iceoryx2, I've found that the communication pattern that I would like to test is the 'event' one, so without having to explicitly poll for the new data.

I took _cxx/event_multiplexing_ example as reference code, but I noticed that apparently I cannot send data through that mechanism, so the strategy I implemented is to first publish the data as in _cxx/publish_subscribe_ example and then using the event communication pattern to wake up the consumer process that will poll only one time in order to get the published data (as explained in the _cxx/publish_subscribe_ example).
The operations executed in the time lapse recorded are:

Publisher side:
- the publish of the data struct
- the event trigger

Subscriber side:
- the wakeup from the trigger
- the 1 time poll to get the data
- the time needed to compute time diff with the timestamp recorded in the sent struct by the publisher

The results I got are comparable without substantial differences w.r.t the first iceoryx, as the following graphs show:

Would you be open to contribute the benchmark? The perfect place would be `benchmarks/cxx` and then I will later move the current benchmarks into `benchmarks/rust`.

> eventually if sending data through events is possible

This will never be possible on that level. We explicitly separated the payload delivery (pubsub or request response) from the wakeup mechanism in iceoryx2. The reason for separation are
* in an unseparated form the publisher will always trigger the other side with a syscall which can cause overhead
* complex events are impossible to realize like: trigger other side only when 2 samples from service A and one sample from service B is delivered and its Friday
    * with classic iceoryx you would constantly wake up the other side, causing unnecessary scheduling overhead etc
* ability to explicitly poll for data without any syscall when a higher executor instance woke you up

You implemented it exactly like it was intended to be used. Yesterday we also added a more complex example describing this setup, take a look at: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/cxx/event_based_communication

> So I would like to as you if there's a smarter way to conduct the benchmark

The benchmark we did was to measure a ping-pong setup. 
 * You have two processes P1 and P2
 * A pubsub and event service S12 for communication from P1 to P2 
 * A pubsub and event service S21 for communication from P2 to P1

For your benchmark you would do the following:
 1. Send a sample from P1 to P2 via the publisher of S12
 2. Send a notification from P1 to P2 via the notifier of S12
 3. Wait on P2 until you received the notification
 4. Send a sample from P2 to P1 via the publisher of S21
 5. Send a notification from P2 to P1 via the notifier of S21
 6. Wait on P1 until you received the notification
 7. GoTo step 1

You repeat this cycle 1.000.000 times an measure the runtime T. Then you divide the measured runtime T by 1.000.000 times 2. Times 2 because you had here a two way communication, once from P1 to P2 and then back from P2 to P1.

The reason why we did this is, that the underlying system time call `clock_gettime` may have a huge overhead compared to the overall iceoryx2 communication. On some AMD systems, we observed a runtime of around 1us, which is hard when the latency of iceoryx2 is 100ns, so this call can increase the runtime by a factor of 10. But when you repeat the communication 1.000.000 times and call `clock_gettime` only twice (once at start and once at the end) the overhead influence of that call becomes irrelevant.

> eventually if sending data through events is possible. If that's possible, an example would be very useful.

Btw. in the long-term we want to introduce something like a meta port which contains all ports and does the event notifications for you so that you can enjoy a much simpler API. But this port would have the disadvantages I described above. When ultra-low latency is not a requirement this becomes a nice alternative.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6VR_je/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That's for sure, give me the time to get it written as good as I can, then I'll be pleased to share with you! Also feel free to edit the benchmark as you prefer, since I'm testing a use-case I need for my application, infact that 100us red dashed line was a reference I selected based on my previous benchmarks.

> The benchmark we did was to measure a ping-pong setup.

I see, that's a great way to conduct the test and I agree with the strategy you adopted! In my case I would be interested also on benchmarking the readiness of the system when there is a delay between a ping-pong and the next one, in order to simulate what happens if, for example, I publish some data at a certain frequency, like 1Hz, 10Hz, 100Hz etc... That's one of the main focuses of the benchmark I'm doing. Infact, from the actual results I got, it looks like that the lower the frequency between publishes the higher the response time to wake up the subscriber process in front of an event. Before talking about numbers (actually ~50us difference from 100Hz and 1Hz), since I'm pretty new to Iceoryx, I would like to ensure myself to have done my best to get the benchmark written the fastest way possible.

> The reason why we did this is, that the underlying system time call clock_gettime may have a huge overhead compared to the overall iceoryx2 communication....

That's really interesting, I'm working on a solution to benchmark the way I need, trying to exclude that huge overhead.

What you observe here is a delay in the operating system. The lower the frequency is, the longer the receiving side sleeps, and the OS puts a process into a deeper sleep the longer it is inactive. Meaning, processes that are getting activated with a high frequency are getting more often rescheduled and are maybe in a higher priority scheduling queue and inactive process are rescheduled with a lower frequency and are moved to a low priority scheduling queue. Or maybe when there is a priority queue in place the priority of that process decreases over time - depending on the underlying scheduler of the OS.

To have a more responsive system, you could on linux compile your own kernel and configure it with the parameters:
* https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/HZ_1000.html
* https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/PREEMPT.html

This should increase the frequency with which the scheduler checks for process activities, at the slight cost of an increased CPU load.

> To have a more responsive system, you could on linux compile your own kernel and configure it with the parameters:

I'm working on a NVidia Jetson Xavier AGX, actually I've finished right now checking both and it seems they are set by default as you suggested.
By executing `uname -a` I get: _Linux tegra-ubuntu 5.10.216-tegra #1 SMP **PREEMPT** Wed Aug 28 01:46:00 PDT 2024 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux_

In order to determine the timer interrupt frequency I followed [that guide](https://advenage.com/topics/linux-timer-interrupt-frequency) that gives a small test to unveil the setting (since I don't have a /boot/config- file to read on the NVidia Jetson...) and its result is:
 _kernel timer interrupt frequency is approx. 4016 Hz or higher_.

> The lower the frequency is, the longer the receiving side sleeps, and the OS puts a process into a deeper sleep the longer it is inactive.

Actually my setup sees publisher, subscriber and RouDi running on maximum real time priority level (99) on a round robin scheduling scheme (I used [chrt](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chrt.1.html) for that and obv checked via htop that the priority was set correctly). Other than that I locked CPU frequency at maximum frequency for the Xavier (~2.2GHz, 8 cores) with Performance scaling governor applied and MAXN nvpmodel.  The board was completely left unload during the benchmarks and also a run varying roudi/subscriber/publisher priority in [99RT, 100CFS, 119CFS] trying all possible combinations of them has been done and the pattern showing the increasing response time with longer publish periods still shows on.

Is there anything else I can do to dig more on that?
Thanks in advance

It stated that round-robin is a suboptimal scheduling algorithm, especially when it comes to processes waiting for IO - exactly what you are doing here. Waiting for an event notification that is sent via a UNIX datagram socket.

Could you try other schedulers? Maybe deadline or CTF will provide better results - I am not an experts on schedulers so those are just wild guesses. I think I would explore schedulers and how they work to optimize the reaction time.

Maybe you are able to decrease the latency of waking up another process but it could come at a high price, higher CPU load and then the actual computation time increases which would then increase the latency of the overall system.

Waking up a process/thread that is in deep sleep always takes a bit longer, since the process and memory has to be reloaded. So the simplest way to avoid a deep sleep is a busy loop - but this will cost massive CPU time.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6V3ADJ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* This example introduces events: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/rust/event
* This example demonstrates how pub/sub can be combined with events: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/rust/event_based_communication to achieve a communication like iceoryx classic but which is much more flexible

> and what is the difference between pub/sub and listen/notify

* pub/sub sends the actual payload like the sensor data in an unidirectional way, meaning always from publisher to subscriber
* events are used to exchange notifications between processes and shall be used to wake up other processes whenever something interesting has happened. the events have an id (u32) to distinguish them. One process can wait either on one listener, or multiple listener and file descriptors (waitset: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/examples/rust/event_multiplexing) until an event arrives. The event will then wake up the process and inform it on what channel what event id arrived.

So the normal workflow looks like:
1. One process processes a specific work load, maybe sends multiple samples via multiple publishers to many processes.
2. When the process is finished it can emit an event via the notifier to wake up the other processes that are waiting on the waitset or listener to inform them that they can now process their work.

The decoupling of pub/sub and event in iceoryx2 has now the advantage that the user can define and emit any kind of custom event. In classic iceoryx there was only one event: `HAS_DATA_RECEIVED` (or something like this) which was always emitted implicitly by the publisher whenever a sample was sent. In iceoryx2 you have now the total freedom - you can emit the event only on fridays when the sky is blue, or when publisher A has sent 2 samples and publisher B 5.

Currently, service QoS settings can be handled by:
1. explicitly stating them and make them a requirement when a service is opened
2. not stating them and implicitly use the default values used by the service.

The idea is to introduce some kind of enum to make this more visible in the API.

```rust
let service = node.service_builder().some_setting(SettingEnum::Default).another_setting(SettingEnum::Require(123).create();

By the way, what is the function of `HISTORY_SIZE`? Does it store the history messages of the publisher? In other words, can a subscriber receive up to 20 history messages from the publisher?

If  I don't set this value, it can work? Because In some case I never mind the history value, so I don't want to subscriber this value.But In my practice, it default to 1 not zero","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6Yo4sF/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks for your reply. I also want to ask: there are three method to write data in a shared-memory, 
>  inline void SampleMutUninit<S, Payload, UserHeader>::write_payload(T&& value) 
>  inline void SampleMutUninit<S, Payload, UserHeader>::write_from_fn(const iox::function<typename T::ValueType(uint64_t)>& initializer)
> inline void SampleMutUninit<S, Payload, UserHeader>::write_from_slice(iox::ImmutableSlice<ValueType>& value) 

Is there a C++ API similar to iceoryx1 where I can manually loan shared memory of a desired size and release it through explicit user calls? In iceoryx1 I use 
> iox_pub_loaned_shm_ptr = iox_pub->loan(loan_size) to loan shared memory of a desired size
> iox_pub->release(iox_pub_loaned_shm_ptr) to release it.

For this use-case, the `Slice` payload type should be used (representing an arbitrarily sized chunk of memory).

Take a look at this example: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/examples/cxx/publish_subscribe_dynamic_data/src/publisher.cpp#L55

Note that you can also access a pointer to the shared memory via something like:

```
auto sample = publisher.loan_slice_uninit(required_memory_size).expect(""acquire sample"");
auto ptr = sample.payload().data();
```

You can then do a placement new, or populate the bytes via any other mechanism, but you have the ensure not to exceed the loaned size yourself, so it is safer to use one of the provided methods that you listed.

> release it through explicit user calls

The sample is released when it goes out of scope through RAII mechanisms. You can also manually destruct the sample to achieve this.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6YriLI/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have a question about DDS sample lifecycle management. In a distributed scenario where Process A publishes data and Process B subscribes to it, if the sample is released when it goes out of scope in the publisher's function, will this affect the subscriber's ability to receive the data?
Additionally, how can I manually destruct the sample?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6Yrj2E/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. How many publishers are there in the setup?
2. Do you use the default configuration or do you specify certain QoS like: publisher history size, subscriber max buffer size, subscriber max borrowed samples, publisher max loaned samples, safe overflow. If you set one of the parameters, please provide me the values.

Your problem is, that the completion queue capacity is exceeded. The capacity is calculated as the sum of the subscriber buffer size `N` + subscriber max borrowed samples `B` + 1 (required when the processes interrupt each other).

Whenever the publisher delivers a sample, it calls `Publisher::retrieve_returned_samples` first to acquire all returned samples from the completion queue. The thing is, I cannot think of a scenario where the completion queue needs a capacity greater than `N + B + 1`.

Here are some abstract scenarios I have drafted, maybe you have an idea how the capacity of the completion queue can be exceeded - if you cannot create a reproducible minimal example.

* subscriber buffer size = N, subscriber max borrowed samples = B
* subscriber current borrowed samples = S
* submission queue size = Q (capacity = N)
* completion queue size = C (capacity = N + B + 1)

Case 1:
* Start state: Q = N, C = 0, S = B

1. Publisher sends sample
   * Publisher::retrieve_returned_samples()
   * Publisher interrupted
2. Subscriber returns B samples
   * C = B
   * S = 0
   * Q = N
3. Subscriber consumes N and returns all N
   * C = B + N
   * S = 0
   * Q = 0
4. Publisher continues and delivers sample
   * C = B + N
   * S = 0
   * Q = 1
5. Subscriber consumer sample and returns it
   * C = B + N + 1
   * S = 0
   * Q = 0

Case 2:
* Start state: Q = N, C = 0, S = B

1. Subscriber returns sample
   * Interrupted before ZeroCopyReceiver::release() call
2. Publisher sends sample
   * Publisher::retrieve_returned_samples()
   * Publisher interrupted
3. Subscriber continues and releases sample
   * C = 1
   * S = B - 1
   * Q = N
3. Subscriber consumes another sample
   * C = 1
   * S = B
   * Q = N - 1
5. Publisher continues and delivers sample
   * C = 1
   * S = B
   * Q = N
6. Subscriber consumes and releases all samples

This can also be the root cause since no construct of iceoryx2 is thread-safe. If you want to access the publisher from multiple threads you can create a separate publisher for each thread.

I created a pull request #572 that addresses one issue that can lead to the error you encountered. But it happens when the subscriber has a smaller buffer size than the history size, and the history is consumed on the subscriber side while the publisher is delivering it.
Could you please try out this version? Maybe it has already fixed your issue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6Y6aL9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Actually, this is not enough since the `SampleMut` is coupled with the `Publisher`, and as soon as you call send, you have a concurrency issue again which could lead to the exact scenario you are observing. This can only be handled with a low level mutex deep inside the publisher on the Rust side. We will tackle this problem soon and provide on the Rust and the C++ side publisher/subscriber and sample versions that are out-of-the-box threadsafe.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6Y6kmu/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@elfenpiff  okay but I still don’t understand why the “ExceedsMaxBorrowedSamples” error occurs in 'Subscriber' side. My implementation is the code mentioned above.

A wild guess is that it depends on the amount of shared memory the publisher wants to use and with the default configuration, this limit is reached with ~8M","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6Zp2hR/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

But for me, it is not 8 MB. It is ~20MB. And I am not out of memory.

Could you please add `set_log_level(LogLevel::Trace);` to the beginning of your source code, rerun the code again, and send me the output?

I think we hit some kind of internal Windows limit here, and I'll try to provide at least a better error message,e but in the meantime, you can adjust some service settings to reduce the required memory via the service builder:

```rust
    let service = node
        .service_builder(&""Service With Dynamic Data"".try_into()?)
        .publish_subscribe::<[u8]>()
        .max_subscribers(1)
        .history_size(1)
        .subscriber_max_borrowed_samples(1)
        .subscriber_max_buffer_size(1)
        .open_or_create()?;
```

It panicked at sending 8388608 bytes, and after applying your suggestion, the number is now 67108864. Thanks!

And my PC has 32 GB memory and the paging file size is configured to approx. 6 GB.

This is why we initially decided against it and used `C:\Temp`. But you can override the default folder via the iceoryx2 config and choose whatever you want, see https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/config

We require a tunnel or gateway to connect multiple `iceoryx2` instances on different machines with each other. 

A Gateway utilizes another host-to-host-capable communication mechanism to connect `iceoryx2` instances on different hosts. Applications using this mechanism will also be able to hook into the traffic.

A tunnel writes `iceoryx2` payloads directly to the transport, which requires more configuration and does not enable hooking into the network traffic from non-iceoryx2 applications, but the reduced overhead improves latency.

## Detailed information

### Requirements

 * The gateway shall be configurable
   * it comes with a allow/deny list - services can automatically be shared with the world or are explicitly excluded
   * the configuration is in TOML - like the rest of the iceoryx2 configuration
   * a gateway config shall also contain protocol specific configurations
   * the config shall contain options for peer2peer as well as multicast communications
     * peer2peer example: provide a list of all iceoryx2 endpoints with ip/port
* If possible, the gateway shall not come with extra background threads. The user shall be able to handle everything in the main thread.
  * Certain protocol enforce background threads, but our implementation shall not
* The gateway shall be traffic efficient
  * only publish things that are required from an endpoint in the network
* Gateway shall be usable right out-of-the-box
  * Sane default configuration
  * iceoryx2 provides a service discovery service that is provided by every gateway. this allows other gateways to discover local services
* Service Discovery is written so that it does not require a background thread
   * it shall be split into two parts: 1. the library that performs the service discovery, 2. a binary that can be started and provides the service discovery service
   * the library shall be usable from within an arbitrary application. in the main loop one can call the loop callback of the service discovery to update the internal state and send out updates
   * publish-subscribe: service diff details like: service X, new publisher
   * request-response: to provide full service state
   * event: to notify others about service diff details
   * requires a user side struct for convenience to handle the service diffs(pubsub), state(rpc), events with one convenenient API
* so that samples are not forwarded in circle we need to be able to determine the machine origin of a sample
   * (if possible) find a way to generate a machine unique id automatically and use it in the gateway, otherwise the user must provide a unique id
   * the pubsub header must be extended so that the id can be stored there
* gateways and service discovery must be able to support multiple service styles:
   * ipc::Service, local::Service and future gpu::Service or hypervisor::Service
   * gateways shall support different iceoryx2 configs, see: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/config
   and https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/config/index.html


### Next Steps

 - [ ] implement service discovery
    * use `Service::list()` to acquire all static service infos, see: https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/service/trait.Service.html#method.list
    * connect to service to acquire dynamic service info, see:
```rust
// event
let service = self.node.service_builder(element.static_details.name()).event().open().unwrap();
let dynamic_config = service.dynamic_config();

// pubsub
ipc::Service::list(Config::global_config(), |element| {
match element.static_details.messaging_pattern() {
iceoryx2::service::static_config::messaging_pattern::MessagingPattern::PublishSubscribe(config) => {
if let Ok(service) = unsafe { self.node.service_builder(element.static_details.name())
                        .publish_subscribe::<[CustomPayloadMarker]>()
                        .user_header::<CustomHeaderMarker>()
                        .__internal_set_payload_type_details(&config.message_type_details().payload)
                        .__internal_set_user_header_type_details(&config.message_type_details().user_header)
                        .open() } {
                        let dynamic_config = service.dynamic_config();
```
 * event, use: https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/service/dynamic_config/event/struct.DynamicConfig.html
 * pubsub, use: https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/service/dynamic_config/publish_subscribe/index.html
 * The internal but public methods acquire more details:
     * pubsub: `dynamic_config.__internal_list_subscribers()`, `dynamic_config.__internal_list_publishers()`
     * event: `dynamic_config.__internal_list_listeners()`, `dynamic_config.__internal_list_notifiers()`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/593/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If you remove the shared memory part of a service, but the static storage remains, iceoryx2 assumes that the service itself is corrupted and does nothing.

So whenever an iceoryx2 application crashes, every other iceoryx2 application will cleanup all of its stale resources whenever:
1. a new node is created
2. a node is destroyed
3. it connects to the service to which the crashed application was previously connected.

So, there is no need to remove resources for you.

If you need to remove resources manually, you have to remove all of the service files. See the FAQ: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/blob/main/FAQ.md#a-crash-leads-to-the-failure-publishsubscribeopenerrorunabletoopendynamicserviceinformation

So in your case `rm -rf /dev/shm/*; rm -rf /tmp/iceoryx2/*`.
But be aware that this removes all services! If they are currently running and in used by other processes, they will continue working but new participants will no longer be able to connect to them.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6bj4hT/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Currently, the config file path `$PWD/config/iceoryx2.toml` has the highest load order. It is perfect for playing around with iceoryx2, running the examples with cargo run, and for development, but it may also lead to annoying bugs when this is the case for production systems.

This issue requires that `getpwnam_r` and `getpwuid_r` is implemented for Windows. This might be a challenge since the Windows user id (SID) is fundamentally different from the posix uid. One solution could be a SID hash to `pid_t` and then have an internal `pid_t` -> `SID` hashmap to translate between those two, like it is done for `HANDLE` and file descriptors.

 * [ ] `$PWD/config/iceoryx2.toml` shall not be used as config file lookup
 * [ ] all C, C++ and Rust example documentations must be adjusted
 * [ ] adjust `config/README.md`
 * [ ] user must be easily able to provide a config file path to iceoryx2

Inspired by the following conversation: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/pull/616#discussion_r1940964975

The iceoryx2 config folder shall contain subfolders with the domain name so that every domain can have their individual configuration.

From @elBoberido 

```
.config/iceoryx2
  |- generic
  |- io.iceoryx2
  |- org.phantom

A node created via `NodeBuilder::new()` would end up in `generic` and a node created via `NodeBuilder::new_with_domain(""org phantom.opera"")` would end up in that domain. One could think of moving everything to `.config/iceoryx2/domains/`, in case we need other, iceoryx related folders in `iceoryx2`. Each domain could have it's own config file. If that's not present, look at `/etc/iceoryx2/domains/org.phantom.opera/iceoryx2.toml`, then `.config/iceoryx2/domains/iceoryx2.toml` and finally `/etc/iceoryx2/domains/iceoryx2.toml`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/618/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

**Rust version:**
rustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)

**Cargo version:**
cargo 1.83.0 (5ffbef321 2024-10-29)

**iceoryx2 version:**
main (0f47a5b)

**Detailed log output:**
[trace-log-output.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18664063/trace-log-output.log)

**Observed result or behaviour:**
When trying to create services with certain names (that have been used in the past) I get the error: `PublishSubscribeOpenOrCreateError::PublishSubscribeOpenError(ServiceInCorruptedState)`. If I change the service name it works fine. I tried to restart my mac as in the past when a service wasn't shut down properly on Mac you had to restart, however that didn't appear to fix anything.

Reproduction example:
```
let node = NodeBuilder::new()
        .create::<ipc::Service>()
        .expect(""Failed to create node"");

    let service = node
        .service_builder(
            &""/inference0/detections""
                .try_into()
                .expect(""Failed to convert service name""),
        )
        .publish_subscribe::<[u8]>()
        .open_or_create()
        .expect(""Failed to create or open service"");
```

**Expected result or behaviour:**
The service should be opened or created, any bad state should be cleaned up.

**Conditions where it occurred / Performed steps:**
It seems to have started right after I updated my Mac to the latest OS. Granted that could also just be a coincidence as according to the detailed log it appears to be some issue with mismatched version iceoryx2 version. Is this expected? Is there any way to fix it without downgrading iceoryx2?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/619/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I think the problem is that we have to make the underlying issue more visible for the user.

In the trace log you provided, the following lines point you to the underlying problem:

```

When processes want to communicate via iceoryx2, they must all use identical iceoryx2 versions; otherwise, iceoryx2 will not try to connect, clean up, or do anything with the communication resources it discovers.
In this case, you mixed 0.4.1 with 0.5.0.

But sometimes, a crashed node cleans up partially so that another iceoryx2 instance can no longer acquire the version number of the remaining stale resources - in this case, it tries by force to clean up everything since the assumption is that something really went wrong.

Could you please reboot your whole system (so that every stale resource gets cleaned up by a clean reboot) and try to reproduce the problem again? I think the issue came with the version mixup and then different iceoryx2 versions created different communication resources and then blocked since they were no longer consistent, causing your problem.

If this fixes your issue, I would add a FAQ entry and try to find a better way to print a nicer error log message to highlight this problem.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6dJDHX/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Before filing this bug I tried restarting and it didn't fix it. My best guess is somehow my nodes got out of sync version wise, so even when restarting it didn't fix it. Then once I started messing with the versions they got back in sync so once I restarted a second time everything was in sync version wise and had a clean slate. Purely speculation, however that's the only way I could explain why the first restart didn't fix things, and the second did.

I do think surfacing that there is a version mismatch in the error would definitely be helpful. Trying to interpret trace level logs can be hard sometimes when you're not familiar with what is recoverable and what isn't. Potentially even just making the version mismatch a higher log level could at least be a partial solution.

Thanks again!","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6dNsob/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

## Required information

**Operating system:**
MacOS Sequoia 15.3
`uname -a`: `Darwin Tyrion.local 24.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:23 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020 arm64`

**Rust version:**
rustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)

**Cargo version:**
cargo 1.83.0 (5ffbef321 2024-10-29)

**iceoryx2 version:**

**Detailed log output:**
[without-tracing.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18695188/trace-log-output.log)

[with-tracing.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18695220/trace-log-output.log)

**Observed result or behaviour:**
Without tracing and `logger_tracing` feature not enabled:
```
set_log_level(LogLevel::Trace);

let node = NodeBuilder::new()
    .create::<ipc::Service>()
    .expect(""Failed to create node"");

let service = node
    .service_builder(
        &""/omnis/definitions""
            .try_into()
            .expect(""Failed to convert service name""),
    )
    .publish_subscribe::<[u8]>()
    .open_or_create()
    .expect(""Failed to create or open service"");
```

With tracing and `logger_tracing` feature enabled:
```
tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .with_max_level(LevelFilter::TRACE)
    .init();

tracing::trace!(""Test log."");

let node = NodeBuilder::new()
    .create::<ipc::Service>()
    .expect(""Failed to create node"");

let service = node
    .service_builder(
        &""/omnis/definitions""
            .try_into()
            .expect(""Failed to convert service name""),
    )
    .publish_subscribe::<[u8]>()
    .open_or_create()
    .expect(""Failed to create or open service"");
```

The example with tracing enabled doesn't output any trace level logs from iceoryx2, only the test log in the example and a warning log from iceoryx2.

**Expected result or behaviour:**
They should both output the same logs (although may be formatted differently).

**Conditions where it occurred / Performed steps:**
The above code should reproduce the bug. The main thing is enabling the `logger_tracing` feature, that is what seems to trigger it.

We have this on our radar to introduce a `{Publisher|Subscriber|Listener|Notifier}Ts` variant, which is threadsafe but requires a mutex.  For mission-critical embedded devices (our first focus), this would be an absolute no-go, but in other areas, it makes sense!

But your issue can easily be addressed. My suggestion is to create a `Node` for each thread, open the service in there and create a `Publisher` per thread - iceoryx2 supports multiple publishers by default. It is restricted to 2 at the moment, but you can adjust your config file and set an arbitrary number there. See: `defaults.publish-subscribe.max-publishers` in https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/tree/main/config

Not that I'm aware of. From the error message it doesn't seem like a sample is lost (although this is almost impossible to verify on our side), just that one of preallocated chunks got corrupted, so I don't know if this will cause a crash down the line after the application runs for many days. I've noticed that this issue happens about twice a day, each time writing 2 lines (that I posted at the start of this issue) that weight about 50MB in the log files: it basically prints my entire preallocated memory chunk as all zeros. This seems to happen at a similar frequency to that of the crashes we used to get with Iceoryx 1. The error messages were similar, I can't find one now but it was something along the lines of POPO_CHUNK_INVALID_CHUNK, and it was fatal, so it's a big upgrade either way.

Would it improve things if I changed my design to something like this to immediately free the sample before calling my callback? This would minimise the time we ""hold on"" to the sample as much as possible, and make it constant. We'd rather not copy those 256 bytes one extra time, but if it guarantees stability we can temporarily keep it this way.

```

  auto sample = subscriber_->receive().expect(kReceiveSucceeds);
  if (!sample.has_value())
    return;
  
  std::memcpy(buffer.data(), sample->payload().data(), FixedSizeByteArraySize);
  cb(buffer);
}

I could reproduce your bug, but only in three misuse scenario.

1. Calling `Publisher::send_copy()` on the same publisher but from different threads 
2. Calling `Publisher::loan()` or `Publisher::loan_uninit()` but from different threads
3. Calling `send(std::move(sample))` in a different thread then where the `Publisher::loan()` was called to get the sample.

Could you take a look at the publisher side if you find any instance where you might access the publisher by accident from multiple threads. Or maybe you can share a piece of code here.

Also to point it out. In classic iceoryx and iceoyrx2 you are not allows to loan a sample in one thread and send or access it in another thread. `send(std::move(sample))` must be called from the same thread as it was loaned.

I could reproduce your bug, but only in three misuse scenario.

Ok, then we'll do an in-depth code review of how we use our publishers, do some tests and report back in a week or so. So you confirm that the change I proposed to my ""receive"" method in my previous comment is useless, right?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6eh1ls/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If we can support you, please let us know! I suspect there is a concurrency issue with the publisher usage since you seem to have the same issue with classic iceoryx which has the same restriction.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6eiscT/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Does it happen more or less periodically? I just want to rule out that there is somewhere a overflow or something similar, e.g. for twice a day, a 32 bit integer would overflow when the publishing rate would be 100kH.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2/issues/comments/IC_kwDOK46AYc6emlnN/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Will keep you posted after we review everything. 

It doesn't happen exactly periodically. I've seen it happen once every 20-28 hours, and I've seen it happen every 4-10 hours. But the field of application is finance, so the message rate has a ton of variance, so I wouldn't rule this theory out completely. For reference, we are dealing with 2-5 billion messages per day, on average.
