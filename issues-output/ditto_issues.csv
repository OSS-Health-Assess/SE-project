We came up with a text for the logo campaign:

---

## Who are you known as?
Ditto

## Tell us a bit about who you are and the people you reach
We need a logo for our open source software project Ditto – [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.ditto](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.ditto)

Eclipse Ditto is a technology implementing a software pattern called “Digital Twins” which we would also like to see reflected in the logo. A digital twin is a virtual, cloud based, representation of his real world counterpart (real world “Things”, e.g. devices like sensors, smart heating, connected cars, smart grids, EV charging stations, …). But those twins are not limited to devices, therefore we speak more generically of ""Things"".<br/>
The technology mirrors potentially millions and billions of digital twins residing in the digital world with physical “Things”. This simplifies working with IoT (Internet of Things) for software developers as they do not need to know how or where exactly the physical “Things” are connected. They can just be used as any other service in the web via their digital twins.

The name of the project has the meaning of the English “ditto”: the same thing again / as has been said before<br/>
The name emphasizes the mirroring / twin aspect as key purpose of the technology.
The Ditto project is part of a larger ecosystem of open-source projects called “Eclipse IoT”. The Eclipse IoT website is available at http://iot.eclipse.org and the logo of Eclipse IoT is attached to the brief – while not mandatory, we encourage designers to provide logos that convey the idea of Ditto belonging to the Eclipse IoT brand.

## What industry do you think your business is most related to?
Technology

## Other notes
* the logo should work both with and without the ""Ditto"" text

Some important keywords relevant to Ditto that we would like somehow to be represented in our logo:
* Internet of Things
* Cloud
* Scalability (i.e Ditto can give home to billions of digital twins)

We'll need a favicon for our website, in addition to the ""regular"" logo.

For ACL that was and is sufficient.

But when using a Policy for a Thing in which I only have ""READ"" permission for a single Feature property I would expect to get a WS message if this property is changed (or also if the complete Feature/Thing is changed and the property was part of that change).

That is however a little difficult as we would have to build ""views"" of each emitted Event for each WS session.

As we do not want to instantiate the PolicyEnforcer for all used policies again in the Websocket sessions I suggest serializing this kind of information (which subject is allowed to read which parts of the Thing affected by an emitted ThingEvent) as header field.

The format of the header could look like:
```json
{
  ""sub1"": [
    ""/features/lamp1/properties/illuminance"",
    ""/attributes""
  ],
  ""sub2"": [
    ""/""
  ]
}
```

This format could be calculated by the `PolicyEnforcerActor` for an incoming `ModifyCommand` - and fill the header based on the actually changed Json fields inside.

The Websocket/SSE would ""only"" have to use a small interpreter for this format in order to return only a partial Event.

* user ""nginx:attr-observer"" is not notified
* user ""nginx:feature-a-status-observer"" is not notified

### Scenario d: Update /features/A of a Thing

* user ""nginx:owner"" is notified with JSON of ""/features/A""
* user ""nginx:attr-observer"" is not notified
* user ""nginx:feature-a-status-observer"" is notified
   * he only receives an event with a JSON containing ""/features/A/properties/status""
   * the ""/features/A/properties/configuration"" is filtered

## Idea for headers serialization format

The internal format (which is calculated for each incoming ""ModifyCommand"" in things service during the enforcement step) of the to-be-determined ""read-subjects"" could look like:

### Scenario a: Update complete Thing

```json
{
  ""nginx:owner"": [
    ""/"",
    ""/attributes"",
    ""/attributes/some"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj/foo"",
    ""/attributes/secret"",
    ""/features"",
    ""/features/A"",
    ""/features/A/properties"",
    ""/features/A/properties/status"",
    ""/features/A/properties/status/speed"",
    ""/features/A/properties/configuration"",
    ""/features/A/properties/configuration/color""
  ],
  ""nginx:attr-observer"": [
    ""/attributes"",
    ""/attributes/some"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj/foo""
  ],
  ""nginx:feature-a-status-observer"": [
    ""/features/A/properties/status"",
    ""/features/A/properties/status/speed""
  ]
}
```

### Scenario b: Update /attributes of a Thing

```json
{
  ""nginx:owner"": [
    ""/attributes"",
    ""/attributes/some"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj/foo"",
    ""/attributes/secret""
  ],
  ""nginx:attr-observer"": [
    ""/attributes"",
    ""/attributes/some"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj"",
    ""/attributes/some-obj/foo""
  ],
  ""nginx:feature-a-status-observer"": [ ]
}
```

### Scenario c: Update /attributes/secret of a Thing

```json
{
  ""nginx:owner"": [
    ""/attributes/secret""
  ],
  ""nginx:attr-observer"": [ ],
  ""nginx:feature-a-status-observer"": [ ]
}
```

### Scenario d: Update /features/A of a Thing

```json
{
  ""nginx:owner"": [
    ""/features/A"",
    ""/features/A/properties"",
    ""/features/A/properties/status"",
    ""/features/A/properties/status/speed"",
    ""/features/A/properties/configuration"",
    ""/features/A/properties/configuration/color""
  ],
  ""nginx:attr-observer"": [ ],
  ""nginx:feature-a-status-observer"": [ 
    ""/features/A/properties/status"",
    ""/features/A/properties/status/speed""
  ]
}
```

## Algorithm at the edge

An algorithm in gateway and connectivity (at the edges) can read the calculated read-subject as calculated above:

* each ThingEvent contains a getResourcePath(), e.g. AttributesModified defines ""/attributes""
   * each event contains the above in concierge calculated read-subjects map which was determined for the command
* a subject which e.g. subscribed for events via WebSocket must
   * be listed as key in the above read-subject map
   * have an entry with the affected getResourcePath() for its subject in the above read-subject map
* a JSON-view has to be calculated if only sub-parts of a complete JSON may be read

## Optimized serialization format

As the serialization format can get quite big, depending on thing and policy size, an optimized format is likely required.

Here are 2 ideas (from @yufei-cai - thanks for the input) to reduce the header size.
1. Merge JSON pointers into a JSON object so that JSON keys at the start (e. g., attributes) are not repeated many times.
2. Collect relevant authorization subjects in an array and refer to them by index (needed for revocation).

The header may look like this for scenario a. Update complete thing:
```json
{
  ""subjects"": [
    ""nginx:owner"",
    ""nginx:attr-observer"",
    ""nginx:feature-a-status-observer""
  ],
  ""tree"": {
    ""g"": [0],
    ""r"": [],
    ""children"": {
      ""attributes"": {
        ""g"": [1],
        ""children"": {
          ""secret"": {
            ""r"": [1]
          }
        }
      },
      ""features"": {
        ""children"": {
          ""A"": {
            ""children"": {
              ""properties"": {
                ""children"": {
                  ""status"": {
                    ""g"": [2]
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The field ""tree"" can be filtered for partial update scenarios.

Other ideas:
3. Replace boilerplate JSON keys ""subjects"", ""tree"", ""children"" by ""s"", ""t"", ""c"" to save space.
4. Record only subjects with partial rights in the ""tree""; other subjects can be treated as ""read-subject"" entries.
5. Write the policy content as a header instead of ""read-subjects"". Gateway and Connectivity perform full policy enforcement on outgoing events.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85NLeBa/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The HTTP API for that could be really simple:

Some initial thoughts on this:

* if a command is not yet implemented for a feature on the live channel a 400 with an ""unimplemented"" notice should be returned. 400, because I don't know if there's any better suited status. 406 sound similar, but is semantically different.
* implementing the commands needs an API to 'plug-in' implementations
* for AMQP and MQTT connected clients I suppose (at least for mqtt) that the client will need an implementation to interact with an mqtt / amqp client ?

This might be worth another issue.

My basic idea here is to have as much of the API as possible defined as ditto protocol for commands, such that I don't need to worry much about status codes and such. Opposed to the messages API where implementation is highly use-case and device specific, which is good since e.g. (vorto) operations implemented as messages follow a custom API.

This is because I'd like the twin channel to only be accessible by the machine, while the user always uses the live-channel to alter things directly. This is to ensure that data is always going through the machine and is eventually dropped if the machine is not available. This is opposed to the desired-state pattern where I place desired state information for a device to retrieve. This is meant for situations where commands expire really fast and you don't want the machine to do anything if it's currently not accessible so you don't end up altering a state in a context you don't understand / know about.

To differentiate this from messages: to reduce the complexity of the used API I'd like to use live-commands instead of messages, because I really just need to set simple configuration values which seems a bit of overkill to use the messages API for.

What do you think?

I'd like to keep the philosophy we currently have: If you don't need validation, just don't start the validation service. The Things service should not have to know anything of any other service IMO.

In case of a partial update the generated JsonSchemas just have to be fine grained enough. That way the validation service does not need the complete state of the feature (it does not even need to know about the Things service).

E.g. with following Feature properties example:

```json
{
   ""properties"": {
      ""status"": {
         ""simple"": ""foo"",
         ""complex"": {
             ""one"": 1,
             ""on"": false,
         } 
      }
   }
}
```

we would need several JsonSchemas which are generated by our Vorto generator:
* properties-schema.json
* properties-status-schema.json
* properties-status-simple-schema.json
* properties-status-complex-schema.json
* properties-status-complex-one-schema.json
* properties-status-complex-on-schema.json

And we would choose the one which matches the partially updated property.

The contributed Ditto generator in Vorto does already a part of that, it generates several JsonSchemas.
But not yet until every leaf of the hierarchy. It would currently only generate (from the example above):
* properties-schema.json
* properties-status-schema.json
* properties-status-simple-schema.json
* properties-status-complex-schema.json","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTUxNTQxNw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I was able to trace this error back to inconsistent behavior between things and things-search, as things-search sometimes
1. is not able to update a Thing (see aforementioned Exception)
2. updates parts of the authorization that is not updated in the things service

To reproduce the problem, you can create a new Thing using API **x** and update the Thing using API **y**, which results in the following outcome:

| API x (create) | API y (update) | Result in things | Result in things-search|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1 |   👍  |  👍   |
| 1 | 2 | 👍  | ❌ |
|1 | 2 (with ACL in body) |  👍 | :x: |

|2 | 1 |  👍 |:x:|
|2 | 1 (with ACL in body) |  👍  |  👍 |
| 2 | 2 |  👍 | :x:|
| 2 | 2 (with ACL in body ) |  👍 | :x: |
| 2 | 2 (with policyId in body) |  👍 |  👍 |

The implementation should be changed to result in a consistent and predictable behavior. Since policies in v2 offer way more configuration possibilities, it should also be forbidden to change back from policies to ACL. I would suggest the following outcome:

| API x | API y | Result in things | Result in things-search|

We already have the ""twin"" and ""live"" perspective being an important differentiation between ""cached state"" and ""actual live state"".
However if a user wants to configure on a Digital Twin the desired state (e.g. ""I want that this light is switched on"") no matter if it is currently receiving the desired change or not, Ditto needs a place to store that.

I would suggest that
* the ""**twin**"" perspective would always track the ""reported"" state of the device
* the ""**live**"" perspective stays as it is: by using ""live"", a device is directly addressed
   * if it cannot receive the command (e.g. in order to retrieve the ""on"" state), the user of the API gets a timeout.
* we add a new perspective ""**desired**"" (name to be discussed) which Ditto saves separately

 I would also like to propose to have a ""common API"" which handles the ""twin/live/desired"" under the hood.
E.g. that a user may trigger API calls in which she defines:
* give me the current value of the ""on"" property (first trying via ""live"", falling back to ""twin"" after a timeout when live doesn't answer in time)
* change the current value of the ""on"" property to `true` (first trying via ""live"", falling back to ""desired"" after a timeout when live doesn't answer in time)

A device may retrieve the state is has still to apply in order to be ""in sync"" with the Digital Twin.
E.g.:
* device comes online and knows it has state revision 42
* devices asks Ditto: ""hey, I am on revision 42, give me the delta of ""desired"" property changes I missed)
* Ditto answers with a diff/delta

This approach is not based on revision numbers but on a second ""copy"" of state - called ""Feature@desired"" for each ""Feature"" of a Thing. This second Feature is is also fully managed within Ditto and also usable by applications.

Devices/gateway have to do some ""co-operation"":
- confirm changes when they are applied
- request a ""patch"" on re-connects (or periodically)

Use two Features for each element that has to distinguish between ""reported"" and ""desired"". Name the first one just ""featureX"" and the second one ""featureX@desired"".
Let the application use both to manage these perspectives. 
This is exactly as described above.

On device side, implement a re-connect mechanism that retrieves the `featureX@desired` via a respective Ditto protocol ""retrieve"" command (see https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-specification-things-retrieve.html#retrieve-all-properties-of-a-feature) . This is needed to catch up with eventually missed updates.
After retrieving the result the device should check which configurations have to be applied by comparing them to it's known state. After successful applying, send respective ""modify"" commands on the `featureX` (without `@desired)`. Optionally the device could in addition to that also send ""delete"" commands to remove properties of `featureX@desired` to indicate that there is no difference between reported and desired.

The discussed issue here would then be an optimization that tries to save bandwidth and potentially also automates the process of sending the change to the device on each re-connect. But you could use this approach already for now without waiting for this issue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzE1ODI4MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Here we go:  
- We will be using this to send messages to the devices coming from the application as documented in the comment from @geglock.
- Our devices send and receive binary payload messages. This implies some sort of translator is in between hono and ditto (https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/issues/492). We are looking into Vorto for this since our binary payload is quite complicated. I don't know whether this is useful information here, but it somewhat describes our setup.
- What does this ""request patch"" look like if our device is sending binary payload?
- Will there be some mechanism to determine which feature@desired will result in a downlink and which feature does not result in a downlink? Some clarification: in some cases the feature has more of a functional meaning. Say you have temperature sensor somewhere which reports the temperature in a feature. The application decides the temperature should change but of course the sensor is not capable to do that. Therefore this should not result in a downlink command but a warning/notification in the business application. See next point for possible solution to this.
- [This example](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-feature.html#vorto-example) shows how the ditto object can use a vorto model in it's definition. How do these definitions relate to generating downlinks? Based on the (non-)existence of the configuration and/or the operation functionblock, we can hold back the downlink command. However, if we are working with a separate feature (@desired), how does this work together? Should we have multiple definitions? Would be nice if both projects could integrate on this and have the possibility to co-exist without a hard requirement for each other.
- Can we already agree on the used convention? Right now we have a use case where we already want to set the desired state and compare them in the business application. Would be nice to have the correct naming convention already. However, this greatly depends on the previous point as well.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTQyOTIxMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I think we should split up this (rather very large) issue and see the following sub-parts.

# sub parts

## Part 1: Persisting ""desired"" state and providing API for that

* enhance the `ThingPersistenceActor` by - in addition to `twin` - persisting `desired` feature properties
* provide API (e.g. HTTP, but also Ditto Protocol) in order to manage/access the `desired` view
   * could e.g. in case of HTTP be a query param `desired`
* no ""magic"" is applied anywhere, this is just an alternative view on a thing
   * no patch/delta calculation
   * no automatic ""downlink"" message containing delta upon device connection


## Part 2: requesting a diff from twin/desired view

* add and handle command(s) (and an HTTP API) requesting a diff
   * use case: to be invoked by a device when it connects in order to retrieve its ""missed"" `desired` changes to apply
   * this would be a Ditto Protocol message, this has nothing to do with binary payload, this is plain JSON which could be e.g. transformed by Ditto's JavaScript based payload mapping (@BobClaerhout, you asked that ;))
* add and handle commands which ""resets"" the `desired` view for when the reported (`twin`) was updated

tbd:
* it does not make sense to create a diff on outdated `twin` data, so I assume that the API would require the device to always either
   * send its `twin` state upon connection (at least the parts the device is interested in diffs for) - @BobClaerhout: that could be the ""mechanism to determine"" which `desired` feature would create a downlink delta message
   * send its last known revision number upon connection
      * downside on that is that Ditto would have to load all historic events between the requested last known revision number and the current `desired` -> Ditto currently does not keep that data but removes it

## Part 3: automated downlink delta for connected devices

Currently I don't know if we even can or want support that to be honest - as mentioned in ""Part 2"" this does only make sense if the device says something about its currently known state .. and that way a automatic mechanism will never work out-of-the-box because it operates on outdated ""reported"" data of a connected device.


# Can we already agree on the used convention?

Before we discuss that I would like to discuss and get the community's input on some alternatives we have.
Please also think about more positives and negatives for each solution, I just started with the ones which came into my mind.
Maybe someone also sees another alternative.

I will gladly enhance this list with community input.


# Implementation alternatives for Part 1

## `@desired` as additional feature

Like described already in this issue above.

```json
{
  ""features"": {
    ""lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Lamp:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""on"": true
      }
    },
    ""lamp@desired"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Lamp:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""on"": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`+`
+ is currently possible by convention
+ already existing features with `@desired` suffix could be supported when Ditto eventually adds this feature
+ policy may be written in a way which defines different access rights for twin/desired features

`-`
- payload duplication (e.g. of the definition)
- `feature` and `feature@desired` would not even have to share the same `definition` -> big potential for mistakes
- when applying Vorto model for `feature@desired` the ""required"" would have to be ignored - as desired properties must be optionally settable,
  so if we strictly apply JsonSchema, another schema for the `@desired` feature would have to be generated setting all ""required"" fields to optional
- `@desired` features must be excluded when using the ""twin"" API and the other way around


## `@desired` on property level

```json
{
  ""features"": {
    ""lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Lamp:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""on"": true,
        ""on@desired"": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`+`
+ is currently possible by convention
+ already existing feature properties with `@desired` suffix could be supported when Ditto eventually adds this feature
+ it does not always make sense to define a complete feature as @desired, only some properties
+ defines fine grained which deltas should be sent downlink
+ Ditto Vorto generator could be enhanced to generate `<property-name>@desired` with same type as `<property-name>` and always optional
+ policy may be written in a way which defines different access rights for twin/desired properties
+ almost no payload duplication

`-`
- `@desired` properties must be excluded when using the ""twin"" API and the other way around

Impl. ideas:
* We could add a special `Predicate<JsonField>` (similar to `FieldType`) for all properties ending with `@desired`
   * that way the `toJson()` of a Thing could use this in order to either 
      * only include non-`@desired` tagged properties
	  * only include `@desired` tagged properties
	  * include all, `@desired` and non-`@desired` tagged properties
   * that could be used at HTTP API level to select the channel e.g. for GETs


## `desired` not visible in thing JSON

This approach would basically save an additional `desired` thing in the persistence.

Twin:
```json
{
  ""features"": {
    ""lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Lamp:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""on"": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Desired Twin:
```json
{
  ""features"": {
    ""lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Lamp:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""on"": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`+`
+ internally handled what is the ""twin"" and what ""desired twin""
+ ""twin"" and ""desired twin"" could potentially even have different `_modified` timestamps and `_revision` counters
+ Ditto Vorto generator would also have to treat the properties of the ""desired twin"" as ""optional""

`-`
- is currently NOT possible by convention

With a write permission on the actual property and a read permission on the `@desired` property there is no circularity. On low bandwith devices it is important to not receive another message when the actual state is set and only receive a message if the desired state is set.

We also observe a difference in sending desired states over live or twin channel. Let me give you my user story to clarify this.

A user (through a frontend) or microservice wants to influence the device. It may do this through the digital twin or the live channel. There are (at least) two cases I can think of right now:

1. The state should be applied immediately and is only valid for the current actual state (e.g. user invokes it directly through a UI or microservice computes the desired state from current state)
2. The state may be applied at any time and has no dependencies
3. The state may be applied at any time, but has dependencies (to complex right now to follow from my point of view)

We solve the first case right now by using live messages, so we have a command/response API and are able to leverage timeouts and do the computation based on the methods (which might not refer to a single property per sé). Another solution would be to set properties over the live channel with a more limited API also resulting in a loss of the desired state if the device is offline (which is desired in this case).

In the second case we want to set a desired state for properties, which will result in a success for this ""correlation"", but may fail when the state is applied. We then would have to emit an event message or something similar. I first thought, that another channel would be good to filter out only @desired messages to reduce bandwith, but this could also be achieved via policies. A device may only have read on it's desired state properties but not on the actual ones having only write permissions on them.

I think we can further make a distinction between desired state of configuration or status. A configuration@desired may be set directly and have or have no side effects. If a status is set however, this implies some more complex computation (maybe also configuration changes invoked by the device) to meet the desired status state. I'm just pointing this out right now, but I don't have any more ideas or thoughts on this at the moment. It's just fascinating :)

Other Ideas
---

* the @desired property could hold an object of the form `{ value: any, _modified: date }` to get a bit more context of single properties

I really don't like the duplication of the last approach and it's error potentials around e.g. 'definition' and the vorto model.

Following that logic, it makes sense to only apply the desired twin split for the `configuration` block:

What could also be another approach, which might be interesting for solving other problems as well:

### Managing metadata for scalar JSON fields

Idea: add another ""_meta"" field which copies the JSON structure, but uses a Json object on the JSON leaves where additional meta information like modification timestamp, revision and desired state are located:

```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:foo1"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:foo1"",
  ""features"": {
    ""lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Lamp:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""on"": true

    }
  },
  ""_meta"": {
    ""features"": {
      ""lamp"": {

This works fine, but creates unnecessary network load because the whole cache is distributed to all shards, even if a shard does not need the data. Another disadvantage of the current approach is that the ""Akka Distributed Data"" cache cannot be cleared, which may cause memory problems in the long run.

In this task, we should at least address the following issues:
- remove policy-cache from search: sync via events and full-sync fallback (without cache) has been tested and works fine
- replace ""Akka Distributed Data"" with a local cache per shard, holding only the data relevant for this shard
    - implement the cache as an LRU cache with a configurable maximum size
   - the cache-entries should be lazy-loaded on first access
    - update the cache whenever the cached data changes (e.g. by Events via PubSub), the things-service and policy-service should no longer write to the cache actively
    - to make sure that the cache is eventually consistent even when events get lost, let the cache entries expire after a configurable time: a re-load will be necessary on next access
    - to further optimize memory usage, remove entries from the cache which have not been accessed for a configurable time

* the Ditto Protocol is not designed to be lightweight - as JSON and with the included data it is quite verbose
* devices connecting to Eclipse Hono and sending their data e.g. via MQTT should not be aware of the Ditto Protocol - they should just send ""what"" data should be changed to ""which"" value

Ditto therefore wants to support a first easy ""mapping"" of those payloads:
* new mappings should be added dynamically at runtime (without the need to restart the AMQP-bridge)
* the mapping should follow the mantra: ""keep simple things simple, make hard things possible""
* mappings must be executed ""sandboxed"": as the mappings could be defined in a programming language, it must be ensured that they don't interfere with the operation of the AMQP-bridge service or any other mappings

-localhost/8081    opened
-localhost/8081/api opened 
-localhost/8081/devops not found
I start docker on ditto/docker/sandbox file and open my browser. I'm writing;

they can't opened.

The sandbox is our instance running at https://ditto.eclipse.org - there you won't be able to open a connection to Hono as we secured that with a password only known to us Ditto comitters.

I just found out that we did not start the `amqp-bridge` in the docker-compose.yml yet and fixed that, so it should work now.

So on your local machine it is possible to connect to a Hono as described in the docs:
https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/installation-operating.html#create-a-new-amqp-bridge-connection

* start Hono (I'm not an expert in Hono, I guess also start it via Docker compose)
* start Ditto via `docker-compose up -d` in the docker/ folder
* once started, execute the described HTTP request:
   * POST http://localhost:8080/devops/piggyback/amqp-bridge
   * use the described payload, the Hono uri is probably a local one, like e.g.: `""uri"": ""amqp://user:password@localhost:5672""`

Check the logs of Ditto `docker-compose logs -f` for errors/other messages.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDQ5ODQ3Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I do that because nginx.conf file doesn't have ""devops""  so: http://localhost:8081/devops.

Now, i solved 403 error. But i can't login http://localhost:8081/devops page (browser and postman).

username: devops in nginx-devops.htpasswd file.but what is devops username? 

I try to add ditto:ditto(hashed)  nginx-devops.htpasswd but it didn't work. 

I can't still login http://localhost:8081/devops.

the authorization subject ""nginx:ditto"" has no effective permission to WRITE a Thing using the Policy from your example. You are granting and revoking WRITE at the same time and a revoke is always considered stronger within ditto.
Assuming that ""nginx:ditto"" is configured as the authorization subject for the amqp connection, removing the revoked permissions on the thing:/ resource should fix it.

* what limits to we apply on Thing/Policy sizes? we have to have a limit and the bigger it is the more problems we get in remoting (e.g. because we have to ""reserve"" the native memory aeron remoting uses )
* I would vote for rather small limits (KiB vs. MiB)
   * AWS IoT has a limit of 8 KiB per ""shadow"" (where 4 KiB is for desired and 4 KiB for actual state)
   * Azure IoT Hub for example has a limit of 256 KiB per ""message"" device-to-cloud and 64 KiB per message cloud-to-device

as 256 KiB are already ~ 10.000 lines in a rather complex JSON genereated with [this tool](https://www.json-generator.com/) and I doubt that this makes sense for a digital twin in our scope, I would even limit it further

Thing/Policy size limit: **64 KiB**
Search response limit to get with one search request: **256 KiB**

Just two remarks/questions (I'm not sure whether this is easily possible):
* Thing responses might actually have 2*64 KiB size, when the ""_policy"" fields is specified
* For search responses I would calculate the maximum response size based on the requested item count if possible (I think currently the maximum allowed item count is 200). I.e., max = (requested item count) * maxThingPayload. Where maxThingPayload might be 2*64 KiB if we support the ""_policy"" field selector for search.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTYxMTc0Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When retrieving a Thing with ""_policy"" this should not be a problem as we would have to configure the max. cluster message size to a higher value in any case (e.g. to the proposed 256 KiB for messages).

Hm, the search is a problem - 200 * 2 * 64 KiB are 25 MiB.
To configure such a huge cluster message size would cost us a lot of memory to reserve (gigabytes for each cluster node).
Therefore I would rather report an error (something like ""result set to large, please consider selecting only required fields or use a smaller page size"") to the user when a search result gets bigger than 256 KiB.
This is a corner case - someone who has such big Things (64KiB ~ 2.500 lines in a complex JSON) has to do compromises IMHO.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTYxNTQ2NQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In fact there is a configuration for always having only one snapshot (and deleting the latest one):
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/things/starter/src/main/resources/things.conf#L68 (just set the environment variable `THING_SNAPSHOT_DELETE_OLD` of the ""things"" service to `true`).
You could also set `THING_EVENTS_DELETE_OLD` to `true` so that the `things_journal` collection also does not get too big.
What these flags do: every time there is a snapshot, the old snapshot and events are deleted.

The role of the snapshots collection is to reduce event replaying efforts and time.
As you probably are aware, Ditto uses [Event Sourcing](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-signals.html) persisting delta changes in `things_journal` and from time to time (e.g. each [500](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/things/starter/src/main/resources/things.conf#L63) events) one snapshot of the complete thing is done to `things_snaps`.

Your statistics says `""avgObjSize"" : 6215555` - so I doubt that each entry is 10MB or more.

What is your use case anyway? Making hundreds of changes per minute on a few things?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzI5Mzc5MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Happy to seeing that. 
Actually, I just configure Ditto server for my client, so not sure his use case. I'm gathering requirements to understand what behind in a scene.
As I observe on my server, around `~1.5 seconds` ditto flush to write record in `things_snaps`, and combine with your hints, I can estimate `350 - 400 events per second`. But he said, < 10 devices and push data in ditto in every 15 mins.

Yes, that are 130 events per minute Ditto will insert into the MongoDB. That alone is not too much.
BUT :)
`akka.remote.OversizedPayloadException: .. max allowed size 10485760 bytes, actual size of encoded class org.eclipse.ditto.services.models.things.commands.sudo.SudoRetrieveThingResponse was 11184007 bytes.`
That error message means that the size of a single Thing was ~11 MiB which is really huge. We currently have a limit of 10 MiB for messages in the Ditto cluster, so no wonder that this fails.

You can do the math what happens if there are 130 inserts per minute with 10 MiB each.

Regarding the WARN message - that one is fixed in our latest release `0.8.0-M1`.

Your client should really think about his use case, we are thinking about reducing the max. message size in the cluster to below 1 MiB due to latency and performance guarantees.
You can configure that higher if needed, but Ditto is not intended to process such huge `Things`.

If you want/need to increase the message size, you can overwrite the max message size:
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/base/src/main/resources/ditto-akka-config.conf#L93

Back to my question:
I totally agree with you about message size should be small, I'm discussing with client to know his use case(some kinds of sensor)
However, we have one `things` greater than 10mb but I didn't see the `akka error message` related to it.
I guess this `things` is ghost, it was not captured by `nginx` server, it was raised from `ditto sync service`, maybe somehow this `things` is lost in DB, but cache some where.

`things` which are not accessed directly via the API are nevertheless synchronized in the background in order to keep the search index up-to-date. That could be the case with this one ..

Ah, regarding the `""authorizationSubject""` you found an inconsistency - the blog post is right, we replaced the single `""authorizationSubject""` with the `""authorizationContext""` containing an array of 
`authorizationSubject` Strings. 
We will fix the outdated documentation.

Are you sure that your Hono instance has this user `consumer@Hono` configured with that password?
I don't know if you have to create the user by yourself or if it automatically exists when starting Hono.
Can you authenticate successfully with for example the Hono client using those credentials?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTUwOTQ1OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the user consumer@Hono is existing and I can connect with this credentials via e.g. the example code for the HonoTelemetryConsumer.

**Scenario** 
We want to restrict access based on the value of one of the significant attributes of a thing - like their _**type**_ - _air-conditioner_ or _elevator_.

[AWS Policies]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) implement a '_Condition_' element for a similar requirement.

1. Does Ditto have something like this (couldn't find it in documentation so far) or do you folks have any thoughts around this?

2. Is '_namespace_' attribute for a thing a good fit for including important attributes like the type of a thing, as mentioned in the example above? If so, then namespace in policy would take care of this I guess.

That's an interesting scenario there - can you share what your team is building with Ditto? We are always looking forward in hearing from people using Ditto.

Ditto's policies unfortunately do not have a comparable ""dynamic condition"" concept. Until now they purely are based on subjects and JSON hierarchy.
It would be technically **very** challenging to put such conditions in our policies (as we for example also apply the policies when using the ""search"" functionality - you cannot find something which you are not allowed to 'READ').

I would however suggest another approach in solving your problem (using the JSON hierarchy).
Model your Things with features `air-conditioner` and `elevator`, e.g.:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto.example:aircond1"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto.example:common-policy"",
  ""features"": {
    ""air-conditioner"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""room-temperature"": 25.7,
        ""desired-temperature"": 22,
        ""cooling"": true
      }
    }
  }
}

{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto.example:elevator4711"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto.example:common-policy"",
  ""features"": {
    ""elevator"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""current-floor"": 2,
        ""next-floor"": 5,
        ""current-speed"": 45.7
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That way you can have the same policy the two things both use, e.g.:
```json
{
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto.example:common-policy"",
  ""entries"": {
    ""admin"": {
      ""subjects"": {
        ""nginx:admin"": {
          ""type"": ""nginx basic auth user: may modify policy + read and write all Things""
        }
      },
      ""resources"": {
        ""thing:/"": {
          ""grant"": [""READ"", ""WRITE""],
          ""revoke"": []
        },
        ""policy:/"": {
          ""grant"": [""READ"", ""WRITE""],
          ""revoke"": []
        },
        ""message:/"": {
          ""grant"": [""READ"", ""WRITE""],
          ""revoke"": []
        }
      }
    },
    ""air-conditioner-user"": {
      ""subjects"": {
        ""nginx:air-cond-user"": {
          ""type"": ""nginx basic auth user - may read+write feature air-conditioner""
        },
        ""nginx:air-cond-user-2"": {
          ""type"": ""nginx basic auth user - may read+write feature air-conditioner""
        }
      },
      ""resources"": {
        ""thing:/features/air-conditioner"": {
          ""grant"": [""READ"", ""WRITE""],
          ""revoke"": []
        }
      }
    },
    ""elevator-user"": {
      ""subjects"": {
        ""nginx:elevator-user"": {
          ""type"": ""nginx basic auth user - may read+write feature elevator""
        }
      },
      ""resources"": {
        ""thing:/features/elevator"": {
          ""grant"": [""READ"", ""WRITE""],
          ""revoke"": []
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So in a nutshell: Use the ""type"" information as features in order to be able to use the resulting structure in your policy.

Regarding your second question: no, namespace is not a good place to put such information as that is nothing the policy looks at when checking access.

We aren't using Ditto at the moment, we already have a few homegrown services, and we'd like to align with Ditto specifications, so we can make a switch to Ditto at some point when we have the capacity. 

Regarding your suggestion, feature looks like a good place to model the type of thing. But this implementation only restricts the user at this feature level, what if we don't want to give the user access to whole thing including top level meta attributes, so they would not show up in the search results at all?

Well, in the example policy I suggested above, the user `elevator-user` will not have access to anything else inside the Thing other than the feature `elevator`. Sounds to me that this is exactly what you want.

The search works like this:
* if the user may `READ` anything inside a thing (e.g. the feature `elevator` from the example), the thing would be returned in the search 
* but: the search does not return the complete thing (e.g. its attributes), but only the parts the user is allowed to `READ`
* the search additionally ensures that the user may only search on fields on which he has the `READ` permission

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/247,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/247,ditto,364543969,247,"Add ""definition"" field to Ditto Thing on toplevel pointing to Vorto informationmodel",thjaeckle,1331526,Thomas Jaeckle,thomas.jaeckle@beyonnex.io,CLOSED,2018-09-27T15:55:39Z,2021-06-22T14:13:50Z,"In #60 Ditto added support for defining ""definition"" on a Ditto feature level, e.g.:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""foo:bar"",
  ""features"": {
    ""red-lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [""org.eclipse.example:Lamp:1.0.0""],
      ""properties"": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```
While that may be sufficient to locally declare the type a feature follows, we cannot represent which type a Thing follows.

In order to do that and use the same concept for the top-level we want to add a ""definition"" on Thing level, e.g. in order to represent a traffic light:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""foo:bar"",
  ""definition"": ""org.eclipse.example:TrafficLight:2.0.0"",
  ""features"": {
    ""red-lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [""org.eclipse.example:Lamp:1.0.0""],
      ""properties"": { ... }
    },
    ""yellow-lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [""org.eclipse.example:Lamp:1.0.0""],
      ""properties"": { ... }
    },
    ""green-lamp"": {
      ""definition"": [""org.eclipse.example:Lamp:1.0.0""],
      ""properties"": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```
The top-level ""definition"" would be filled with a Vorto `InformationModel` which itself contains several `FunctionBlocks` with names we can re-use as feature names.
That way the user can easily grasp the relation between Vorto's modeling concepty and Ditto's JSON structure.

```

I'm sorry, we still could not reproduce it.

I tested it on Windows and my colleague @thjaeckle on Linux, both with the same settings as specified by you (java and mvn version should be irrelevant):
*Docker version*: 18.06.1-ce
*Docker Compose version*: 1.22.0

I have just two ideas:
* After you started docker-compose, a network with the name ""docker_default"" should have been created. Can you please have a look? `docker network ls` should return sth like this:
...
6949ff101f37        docker_default                 bridge              local
...
* Maybe your machine just needs some more time to start the remoting. You could try to increase _akka.remote.startup-timeout_ (default: 10s). For this purpose change the _IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS_ everywhere in docker-compose.yml like this:
IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -Dakka.remote.startup-timeout=60s","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzA0MjU5MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I just wondered if there was some problem with your host firewall configuration, but this does not make sense because the host firewall should not affect the communication between containers. So, it seems that there is some problem with your docker installation.

Maybe you can reproduce this issue with a simple example: create a bridge network, add two containers and try to access one of the containers from the other container via tcp (e.g. with netcat).

For analysing your local computer problem, it would really help if you could reproduce the issue with a simple tcp example.

On your server there seems to be a different issue. To support with this, we would need the complete docker logs (_docker-compose logs_). Maybe you can attach them here?

  When I create a fresh company '**company1**' on my web app, it should able to create ditto users like '**ditto-compay1-admin**', '**ditto-company1-manager**', '**ditto-company1-user**' etc... and create a policy to bind user on its limits. But unfortunately, it seems like we have no REST API to add/update/delete the user and user creation is limited to a file **'nginx.htpasswd'**. If that is the case, we can't achieve the dynamic behavior of policies for such scenarios.

Ditto does not include a user management and Ditto does not provide authentication - that's why we have **as an example** the nginx-based authentication via BasicAuth.
If you need authentication (and a user management), you should combine it with another tool/project providing that. [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) might be interesting for you.

Another alternative to include any other authentication provider you already have (e.g. ActiveDirectory) is to implement your own implementation of interface [AuthenticationProvider](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/gateway/endpoints/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/gateway/endpoints/directives/auth/AuthenticationProvider.java). A good example/starting point could be the [DummyAuthenticationProvider](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/gateway/endpoints/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/gateway/endpoints/directives/auth/dummy/DummyAuthenticationProvider.java) which simply extracts user credentials from a header field `x-ditto-dummy-auth` - that mechanism is used in our example nginx based authentication. The nginx sets this header when a user was authenticated, see example [nginx.conf](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/deployment/docker/nginx.conf#L41).

Towards the JWT based authentication (e.g. via Google) - simply set the JWT `id_token` of a authenicated Google user as `Authorization Bearer` http header. This is default OAuth2.0.
Ditto supports out-of-the-box Google OAuth2.0 provider, see here in the code:
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/gateway/endpoints/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/gateway/endpoints/directives/auth/DittoGatewayAuthenticationDirectiveFactory.java#L91

You can of course also add other OAuth2.0 providers there (e.g. your own Keycloak if you decide to use that).

Maybe there is an nginx plugin which lets you manage users in a database, so this could also be an alternative.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzY1MTU3MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

is there a way to update multiple parts of a twin/thing without affecting the entire thing using the ditto protocol?

example:
- sending an update to path ""/"" would mean:
a) overwriting parts which may not be desired to be update (e..g the vorto ""definition"")
b) updating static properties such as attribute

if i want to update say 10 datapoints on a thing, this would mean making 10 calls to the individual features. the updating client needs to know everything about the thing including all the meta information..

solution: maybe: its possible to send an array of commands for path and value instead of singular values?

Or is there anothe way to do so?

Thanks for the speedy replies.

Unfortunately doing a GET prior to a PUT all the time is not feasible at all.

1. If a device uses the Ditto protocol and it needs to update multiple sensor values (be it via Hono or directly to Ditto), doing a GET all the time is not feasible.  this would mean the device would additionally need connectivity to IoT Things and apiTokens etc to do this.

2. If it isn't sending via Ditto and it sends over a few bytes of byte array which needs to be unpacked into multiple bytes, the Ditto Mapping engine doesn't allow doing a GET anyway prior to update. Additionally you can't use this to do multiple update calls either.

unfortunately currently we don't support something like a PATCH request that allows to update a thing partially.
You're currently required to do multiple PUT requests (ModifyFeature/ModifyAttribute commands) to the respective Attributes/Features if a GET is not possible.
For Features you can even do a PUT request to /things/{thingId}/features/{featureId}/properties (ModifyFeatureProperties) or  /things/{thingId}/features/{featureId}/properties/{propertyPath} (ModifyFeatureProperty).

We currently more think about a new verb in the Ditto Protocol (we currently have: create, delete, modify, read): *merge*
That - differently than ""modify"" - would only update the parts which were specified in the payload and leave the other parts of the thing (or feature, property etc.) JSON intact.

At the HTTP API this could be a POST for *merge* instead of a PUT (for modify).

So I can't really say when this issue will be done.
Currently I don't see it in Ditto 1.1.0, if you want to start contributing on it, we could definitely support when problems arise :)

On a conceptual level it is quite clear how to add this to Ditto and there should be no major ""roadblocks"" when implementing.

For the implementation I see 2 options:
* either copy all `Modify*` command (maybe also event) classes to their `Merge*` counterpart classes
   * e.g.: `ModifyThing` ->copy-> `MergeThing`
   * add separate persistence strategies as well in `org.eclipse.ditto.services.things.persistence.actors.strategies.commands.ThingCommandStrategies`
   * add separate concierge enforcements
   * this would be very many changes towards LoC, duplicated unit tests, etc.
* or: make `Modify*` command (maybe also the event) classes aware of whether ""replace"" or ""merge"" semantics should be applied
   * also persistence strategies must make use of that differentiation
   * concierge enforcement should not be affected

I prefer the second one but am not yet sure if this will work everywhere.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjAwMzI5Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

i will try to answer your questions. 

> I am curious how do you plan to address some of the limitations of JSON merge patch like null values?

Regarding the `null` value we have implemented the spec in the RFC. This means that setting `null` for a key will delete this from the object.
The following example should clarify this:
Given the following example JSON document:
```
{
     ""title"": ""Goodbye!"",
     ""author"" : {
       ""givenName"" : ""John"",
       ""familyName"" : ""Doe""
     },
     ""tags"":[ ""example"", ""sample"" ],
     ""content"": ""This will be unchanged""
}
```
Applying the following PATCH   
PATCH /my/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json
```
{
     ""title"": ""Hello!"",
     ""phoneNumber"": ""+01-123-456-7890"",
     ""author"": {
       ""familyName"": null
     },
     ""tags"": [ ""example"" ]
}
```
 The resulting JSON document would be:
```
 {
     ""title"": ""Hello!"",
     ""author"" : {
       ""givenName"" : ""John""
     },
     ""tags"": [ ""example"" ],
     ""content"": ""This will be unchanged"",
     ""phoneNumber"": ""+01-123-456-7890""
 }
```
I hope this makes it more clear how `null` values are handled.

> How do you envision the events? Currently, the events are somehow self-contained and easy to be consumed. I guess that the even consumer will continue to use them without merge complications, right?

There will be only one ThingMerged event emitted after the merge was successfully applied.
This event contains the path were the patch was applied and the json value.

> I guess that the merge will work in an atomic way. How many events can be produced from single merge request?

Yes each merge command will apply the value from the request to the thing in an atomic way. You can use [conditional-requests](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-concepts.html#conditional-requests) to ensure the order who commands are applied.
So for example it is possible to add/update/delete some attributes and add/update/delete one or more features within a single request.

If you have more questions regarding this feature please let us know.

If we take a concrete example:
`""OutdoorTemperature"": {""properties"": {""value"": 18}},
""IndoorTemperature"": {""properties"": {""value"": 22}}`
i.e. there are two temperature features and we apply patch like:
`""OutdoorTemperature"": {""properties"": {""value"": 15}},
""IndoorTemperature"": {""properties"": {""value"": 24}}`
What is the expected event? How it looks like?

To be honest, I have a little fear that there is no modified event. It seems incompatible change because the existing applications cannot rely only on modified events any more. What do you think about this scenario: features will be modified without modified event?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzEwNTczMA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When applying the merge commands you have to set **Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json**.  This content-type indicates that `null` values will be handled to delete entries from things. 


For every merge command an ThingMerged event is emitted with the path of the thing which is added/updated/deleted and the value.

I wonder how this can be done/modeled:

Imagine Things owned by a company. Within the company you have 2 access/users. One which has ADMIN rights, the other is a TECHNICAL user which has perhaps READ rights for only specific sensitive features. Such rights would be applied to all things.

However, there would be a different class of users who have perhaps rights to another set of features. This could be domain data such as sensor data or device state but NOT the sensitive keys mentioned above. Additionally each user would have rights to only variable set of things and not all of them.

Using a single policy would mean:
1. Maintaining a one-to-one relation between policies and things
2. make it very tideous to maintain such relationships programmatically.

Example:
![folie1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2336402/49063607-30ffaf80-f218-11e8-8c1f-585ebd60791c.JPG)

Is there a solution to this? Am i missing something?

if not, perhaps allowing multiple policies to be applied per thing might make sense. (i.e. one policy per user or actor instead of per asset).
![folie2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2336402/49063889-31e51100-f219-11e8-829b-84aeaa39d47f.JPG)

I recently thought about something which might help you (but I'm afraid this is only a first idea). 
But would be great to get a feedback whether this would also help your use case.

The idea is to enable ""importing"" other policies in a policy, e.g.:
```json
{
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:solution-policy"",
  ""entries"": {
    ""solution-owner"": {
    ...
    }
  }
}
```
The above could be imported:
```json
{
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:customer-policy"",
  ""imports"": {
    ""org.eclipse.ditto:solution-policy"": {
      ""included"": [], // optionally specify includes/excludes 
      ""excluded"": [""end-user""] // if both are empty or missing, all entries are included
    }
  },
  ""entries"": {
    ""end-user"": { // we have to think about what to do with overwrites
    ...
    }
  }
}
```

That would cause that for the second policy, the first policy is imported and merged.
There is no special overwrite semantics - the standard policy way applies: 
* deeper nested hierarchy is more important than less nested 
* on the same hierarchy level `revoke` is stronger than `grant`

Benefits of that:
* policies basically can inherit from other policies (and even multiple ones)
* a single ""solution policy"" could contain administrative entries - once that is changed, all policies and therefore things importing from that are automatically adjusted

WDYT? That should be very similar to ""multiple policies applied per thing"".","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTk1MjcyOQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The problem I see is how to prevent infinite loops when resolving policies (this would be a really intricate issue imo). We could prevent this by importing only ""direct"" entries, i.e. no transitive entries. Of course, this way only one level of ""nesting"" would be supported, but it would also make it easier to understand from a user perspective imo.

We would like to use the former PoC at branch https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/tree/lab/policy-imports and also the stale PR #993 as a basis for the work - as many ""model"" and ""command"" related functionality is already in place.

Some additions to the original concept:
* there is a (configurable) limit of how many policies can be imported from
* for simplification, the ""imports"" shall not be able to define ""included"" and ""excluded"", but only included ""entries""
* transitive imports are not supported (adds a lot of additional complexity)
* a policy entry shall define whether it should be ""importable"", but not with a boolean, but with a string being a enum of (e.g. - terms still part of implementation):
   * ""implicitly"" (being also the default if not defined) - such a policy entry defined by Policy A are always included when a Policy B imports Policy A
   * ""explicitly"" - such a policy entry defined by Policy A can be included when a Policy B imports Policy A when Policy B defines it in the ""entries"" to import
   * ""never"" - such a policy entry defined by Policy A can never be included when another Policy imports Policy A

Example:
Policy A:
```json
{
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:policy-a"",
  ""entries"": {
    ""end-user"": {
       ""importable"": ""explicit"",
       ""subjects"": {
         ..
       },
       ""resources"": {
         ..
       }
    }
  }
}
```

Policy B:
```json
{
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:policy-b"",
  ""imports"": {
    ""org.eclipse.ditto:policy-a"": {
      ""entries"": [""end-user""]
    }
  },
  ""entries"": {
    ""others"": {

@BobClaerhout @vhdirk does this still fit also to your use-case?
I would suggest that we now take the lead on this, as with the new search #1383 and the removal of concierge in #1416 applying the policy imports will drastically change comparing to the implementation I and @vhdirk worked on in #993

Seems like you used the wrong params for building.

From the README.md:

mvn clean install -Pdocker-build-image -Ddocker.daemon.hostname=<ip/host of your docker daemon>
# if you have the docker daemon running on your machine and you are running on Unix, you can also connect against the docker socket:
mvn clean install -Pdocker-build-image -Ddocker.daemon.url=unix:///var/run/docker.sock

A few more bugs( maybe)  , 
as mentioned on this page : https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/installation-running.html

when I run the command : docker-compose up -d , first I got the following error

ERROR: Version in ""./docker-compose.yml"" is unsupported. You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a version of ""2"" (or ""2.0"") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

Now, I removed the    version : '2.4'   line from docker-compose.yml file and tried again but still it shows the following error

hello, am new to ditto and am eager to learn about ditto as I am using eclipse ditto for creating a twin device (a device digital replica ).
I have used the following link as my guideline and followed the step as said.

I have successfully created the MQTT connection and the next step is payload mapping. Before I map with the devices I need to post a payload mapping function which is said to be an incoming mapping function. whenever am creating this function am getting an error of connection refused and you please explain me why?

What makes you assume that you ""have successfully created the MQTT connection""?
It is not the payload mapping which fails according to the displayed error message, but the connection to the MQTT broker.

Best use the [test connection](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#test-connection) command in order to test whether you can connect.

If the message keeps the same:
are you maybe behind a corporate proxy preventing you connecting to ""test.mosquitto.org:1883""?

You should check if you can establish a connection to that host and port.
E.g. via `telnet`:
```
telnet test.mosquitto.org 1883
```
Or via `nc`:
```
nc -zv test.mosquitto.org 1883

From the first look I would say you are missing the `topics` in your `targets`.
But I now see that the blog post also does not include them, we probably missed something there.

Please try adding following `topics` array in your `targets` (as documented in the [connection model](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-connections.html#connection-model)):
```json
        ""targets"": [
          {
            ""address"": ""control/org.eclipse.ditto/{{ thing:id }}"",
            ""topics"": [

            ],
            ...
          }
        ],
```
For command&control (which uses Ditto ""messages""), adding this one topic should be sufficient.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzA5MDQ4Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

From the first look I would say you didn't build the ditto docker images locally on your machine. Is this correct? 

You can either build the images on your own or you can use the docker tag 0.8.0 instead 0-SNAPSHOT to run Ditto.

You can find a detailed description how to build and run Ditto [here](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/installation-building.html):

Indeed, we do not yet have a developer documentation showing how to debug, etc.

What we do in development is simply to start all services right in the IDE (e.g. we use IntelliJ):
* [PoliciesService](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/policies/starter/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/policies/starter/PoliciesService.java)
* [ThingsService](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/things/starter/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/things/starter/ThingsService.java)
* ConciergeService
* GatewayService
* ConnectivityService
* SearchService

Important is to **start the `PoliciesService` first** as this done is used as ""bootstrapper"" during development.

By simply starting them without any arguments, the `*-dev.conf` files are loaded, e.g. [policies-dev.conf](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/policies/starter/src/main/resources/policies-dev.conf).
Those expect to find a MongoDB running on `localhost:27017`. That one can be started inside Docker or started natively on your machine.

The `GatewayService` opens a HTTP endpoint on `localhost:8080` but there is no nginx in front of that during development.
Simply set the HTTP header `x-ditto-dummy-auth` to the form `<prefix>:username` in order to work with different ""pre-authenticated"" users, e.g.: `x-ditto-dummy-auth=ditto:my-user`.

I would like to get your feedback and potential interest on contributions in order to improve the experience with Eclipse Ditto on Microsoft Azure. I wrote a small proposal (see below) covering multiple aspects of the topic.

Let me know what you guys think,

Kai

## Overview

For an optimized [Eclipse Ditto™](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/) experience on Microsoft Azure several aspects have to be considered:

- To deploy and host Ditto on Microsoft Azure.
- To integrate Ditto with applications hosted on Azure.
- Optionally to integrate Ditto with Azure IoT by supporting synchronization with [Azure IoT Device Twin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins) state, e.g.
  - to combine Azure IoT's highly scalable connectivity features with the Ditto feature set.
  - and/or to  leverage Ditto as federation service for devices connected to Azure IoT and other connectivity layers.
  - and/or to integrate [Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/about-iot-edge) with Ditto.

We propose to split the work necessary to allow the Ditto community to leverage these features into three work streams:

- Azure deployment support for Eclipse Ditto.
- Azure PaaS service integration guidance, support and verification.
- Rich collection of samples and references.

As mentioned; before we start digging into these we would like to collect your feedback. Pls keep in mind that this is more a set of ideas at this point and is not to be seen as a promise for contribution by us 😄 

## Proposed architecture

![Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9153035/54420517-77671480-470a-11e9-8daa-9ae81fd8fd3d.png)

## Work streams

### Azure deployment support for Eclipse Ditto

- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) deployment
  - [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) templates (i.e. infrastructure as code) for AKS including network setup.
    - Location proposal: `deployment/azure`
  - Helm templates:
    - Flexible k8s deployment that works for existing Ditto (e.g. Minikube) as well as other environments (like AKS).
    - Include optional setups (k8s ingress, TLS with Let’s Encrypt certs, etc.)
  - Include Azure key vault support (see https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-keyvault-flexvol) including AAD service principal.
  - Provide [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines) reference to setup Ditto build pipeline including Azure Container Registry deployment for Docker images and Helm charts as well as automated AKS deployments.
- MongoDB persistence
  - Evaluate feasibility of [Azure CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) as alternative to MongoDB

### Azure PaaS service integration

- Application integration
  - Ditto ""Target"": Provide and test reference based on [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) (including its Kafka support) and Azure ServiceBus topics.
  - Ditto ""Source"": Provide and test reference based on [Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) queues.
    - To be discussed: is Ditto source expecting a topic or a queue for message consumption?
- Azure IoT Integration
  - Provide integration (service) to exchange data between [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub) with Ditto.
- Testing
  - Run automated integration tests.

### Collection of samples and references

- Guides/publishing
  - Provide complete deployment guide (to be discussed, Ditto website or Readme?)
    - Location proposal: `deployment/azure`
- References/samples
  - Spring Boot based sample apps that retrieves from and publishes messages into Ditto.
    - Sample 1: Receives messages based on Event Hubs Kafka support using Spring Cloud Stream.
    - Sample 2: Send messages to ditto based on Azure ServiceBus (SDK).
  - [Azure Stream Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-introduction) sample that analyses Ditto event stream.
 - Azure IoT Edge end-2-end integration sample.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/358/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sounds really good, we're happy to see that Microsoft has an interest in Ditto.
Your proposal is not that small at all - if we're planning on doing all that, Ditto on Azure almost could feel like a native service I guess :+1: 

### Deployment

I think it makes most sense to start with that, that should be straight forward.
What will be interesting is whether Ditto can use Azure CosmosDB as MongoDB drop-in replacement.

We are currently working on concepts on how to improve our search feature which currently still makes use of MongoDB ""aggregation pipelines"". That won't be the case in the future, so that Ditto doesn't require too fancy MongoDB features.

### PaaS service integration

#### Azure device twin

Interesting to see that the concepts of Ditto's twin and Azure's twin are not that far apart. Personally, I'm not a fan of synchronizing data (especially in ""master""-""master"" setups where data may be modified in any system), so we should clarify what the benefit of such a synchronization would be.

Could also lead into some problems as the Azure twin has more restrictions on how the twin JSON might look like (e.g. forbids using arrays and usage of some special characters in JSON key names, has stronger restrictions on max size of a twin JSON, etc.).

#### Using a Microsoft mechanism for providing authentication for Ditto

One additional integration could be added which might be covered by the ""Azure key vault"" you mentioned, but I'm not sure.

As Ditto only handles authorization based on already authenticated users/devices, etc. (we call that `authorizationSubject`), a way for providing authentication in front of Ditto would be great.
For the Ditto sandbox we currently simply use nginx with a `.htpasswd` file which provides authentication on HTTP and Websocket resources.

If a similar approach is not sufficient, we are currently working on #348 in order to simplify adding new authentication mechanisms.

### Samples

A deployment guide for Azure would be great, location to be clarified.

Samples could go to https://github.com/eclipse/ditto-examples where we don't need to do CQs for dependencies, so adding Spring Boot dependency hell there would be ok, although personally I'm a fan of simplicity and non-magically behaving applications ;)

----

Would be great to also get feedback of some of our users on that.

https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#test-connection
shows exactly the JSON provided in this issue. I guess it's copy pasted from here.

says that the connection needs to be specified, but I suggest making it more clear by using an ellipsis in the connection JSON for the docs.

I checked my connection status and metrics, response with 200.  see below.  Octopus publishing messages are ok, I can see all message from MQTT Client through subscribe. But webapp provided in github can't see these Octopus messages, server send event works, count event 1 by 1.  my.test.octopus panel never change. I used command line to query, only can get one from Webapp saved. I never searched the messages from Octopus. I don't know why?  any advice?

It states that your incoming payload mapping script seems to have an invalid syntax.
As I'm almost sure the next thing happening is, posting your mapping script in this thread, I ask you again to use stackoverflow for questions about usage and tag them with the `eclipse-ditto` tag. This would've allowed me to just edit your question and prettify your log output instead of posting it again in a readable way.
So far I don't think this is a bug or feature request, but a question about usage.
Don't forget to include the payload mapping script you use in your question.

Feel free to reference to your stackoverflow question from this issue :)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODQzODEwOA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The main page at http://localhost:8080/ works fine, as does the Swagger UI.  However, if I try to do anything against the local Ditto instance I get a 502 Bad Gateway issue.  Similar to the other issue, the following pages result in 502 erros as well:

how much memory do you provide to docker in your Docker for Windows settings (see Advanced tab)? Too less memory might cause these issues when starting the containers. I have this setting on 10GB but I am also running some more containers. When only running Ditto you should probably be alright with less than that. If still one of the services fails starting (with the error log you provided), you can try to restart it manually (docker-compose restart <services>).

The 502 probably means that nginx can't contact the gateway service, so the important logs will probably be nginx (docker-compose logs nginx) and gateway (docker-compose logs gateway). Could you please have a look at them?

Best regards,
Florian

AMQP 1.0 specification ss. 2.4.5 states that idle timeout is negotiated at connection open and heartbeats are sent at intervals half of the actual idle timeout. There should be no reason why I can't keep an idle connection open indefinitely.
> At Connection open each peer communicates the
maximum period between activity (frames) on the connection that it desires from its partner. The
open frame carries the idle-time-out field for this purpose. To avoid spurious time-outs, the value in
idle-time-out should be half the peer’s actual timeout threshold.
If a peer can not, for any reason support a proposed idle time-out, then it should close the connection
using a close frame with an error explaining why. There is no requirement for peers to support
arbitrarily short or long idle time-outs.
The use of idle time-outs is any addition to any network protocol level control. Implementations
should make use of TCP keep-alive wherever possible in order to be good citizens.
If a peer needs to satisfy the need to send traffic to prevent idle time-out, and has nothing to send,
it may send an empty frame, i.e. a frame consisting solely of a frame header, with no frame body.
This frame’s channel can be any valid channel up to channel-max, but is otherwise to be ignored.
Implementations SHOULD use channel 0 for empty frames, and MUST use channel 0 if channel-max
has not yet been negotiated (i.e. before an open frame has been received). Apart from this use, empty
frames have no meaning.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDg3NjUzMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Azure Service Bus' timeout seems to be ~9-11 minutes.

I'm not sure why this only happens on Service Bus - as for Eclipse Hono we also have consumers which are ""idling"" 2 minutes. Maybe the AMQP endpoint does however keep them open infinitely.

I just repoduced this by creating a Service Bus instance and connecting to it using the Qpid JMS Client (the client we use in Ditto for connections to AMQP 1.0 brokers). I traced the communication between client and server, the service bus sets an idle timeout of 240000ms in the open frame. This value is interpreted by the Qpid JMS client and it would send a PING to keep the connection open after 120000ms (""remote idle timeout"" / 2). Unfortunately the connection is closed after 60s by the link tracker:
> The connection was inactive for more than the allowed 60000 milliseconds and is closed by container 'LinkTracker'

So it seems that the Service Bus does not respect the idle timeout set by itself. I can provide a simple reproducer if required.

It's something that can stand alone and does not belong to any service.

For `signals` I'm only partially with you.
I think something like [Command](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/signals/commands/base/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/signals/commands/base/Command.java) should be specified in a separate module like it is right now. I'm not sure if signal is the best name for this, but I don't want to discuss about naming. Maybe we could think about a core module that does hold anything (maybe by sub modules) that is relevant for all services in ditto? But why is it helpful to define the API for a service like policies in a module outside of the policies service module? Couldn't be the signal module for policies a sub module of policies service?

What I would except is that each service of ditto provides all it needs as submodules. Right now the policies service is spread all over the repository.
This makes adding new services or removing/deprecating services more difficult as you have to search all over the repo for things that belong to the service.

This would also make the boundaries of modules more clear. For example why is ditto-model-enforces an API? Should this be used outside of the ditto service? For me this is part of the concierge.
We currently do enforcing for example in ThingSearch, too. Is this intended? Shouldn't be concierge the one service that is responsible for authorization?

Another module is ditto-model-base. There is for example an auth package which is for me an independent module: security.
This module security could contain all AuthenticationProviders and everything that is required for authentication and authorization.
To my understanding it then should be sufficient to include this module in the gateway (authentication) and in concierge (authorization). Maybe in connectivity too because its kind of an API Gateway aswell. But its not required in all services in my opinion.

So in one sentence what I think ""is better then"": I think this would lead to a less confusing architecture with less dependecies to other services, what will lead to more independent microservices with a clearly defined API per service in the end.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjM5MjEwMA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It's not only the API for service-internals, but also for the Ditto Protocol and the (soon) to be added Java-client. Therefore it is helpful to separate between API and service.
That's the main point of why `model` and `signals` is on top-level.

What we experienced before applying that structure (before the initial Ditto code contribution) is that modules had cyclic dependencies all over the place. With the current structure the following dependency hierarchy is defined:
```
module(s)  |  referenced by
utils      <- json, model, signals, protocol-adapter, services
json       <- model
model      <- signals
signals    <- protocol-adapter
utils, json, model, signals, protocol-adapter <- services
```
So anything in `model` isn't allowed to reference something in `signals`, `protocol-adapter` or `services`.
Anything in `signals` isn't allowed to reference something in `protocol-adapter` or `services`.
And so on..

> This makes adding new services or removing/deprecating services more difficult as you have to search all over the repo for things that belong to the service.

Yes, but it also adds the required structure in order not to completely mess up dependencies.

>  For example why is ditto-model-enforces an API? Should this be used outside of the ditto service?
Because it also can be used as API, e.g. retrieve the policy from the backend and enforce the policy locally before talking to the service.

By having the enforcement as module the complete policy enforcement could be used standalone from the Ditto backend.

> We currently do enforcing for example in ThingSearch, too. Is this intended?

ThingSearch does enforcement on database query level, this is intended, yes. I don't think that it does the same as concierge, it may however need the same information from policies.

> Another module is ditto-model-base. There is for example an auth package which is for me an independent module: security.

Sure, that's a good idea.<br/>
As this would be used in 3 of 6 Ditto services I would also see that as a module built for re-use, but probably not in `models` but in a submodule of `services`.

> I think this would lead to a less confusing architecture with less dependecies to other services, what will lead to more independent microservices with a clearly defined API per service in the end.

I think it's important to define the API of the microservices (which currently is basically JSON commands, responses and events) as separate `model` and really treat those as API. With that approach we seldom had issues with breaking the API and/or JSON format in the past. I'm not convinced that this will be better when we move the models closer to the service implementation.

I agree that we should avoid inter-service dependencies - if services need common functionality, we should extract a new commonly used module.

I however don't see that we have a confusing architecture (at least not on modules level ;) ). Maybe it would help to have a picture in place?

As such a discussion is right to be done before a 1.0 release we should have it now, yes. Could you draw a diagram of how you would ""cut"" the modules architecture including inter-module dependencies?
I think that would help in seeing if that reduces complexity or not.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjQwMTQ0Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

EDIT:

Ok, well, I got closer to an answer. I took the nginx-devops config from the subfolder sandbox because I was searching for a way to work with the devops API and couldn't find something in the docs. Apparently I have to at least configure the same passwort in nginx as well as in the gateway-container through the environment variable `DEVOPS_PASSWORD`.

Not at all - good question why we added the `nginx-devops.htpasswd` on the `/devops` route in nginx. 
Should not be necessary to include that one, sorry.

> Is there a reason why this is documented nowhere?

No good reason at all. ;)
The docker-compose of the sandbox is what it is: a sandbox setup which is not necessarily a perfect fit for usage in production.
And the documentation is also what it is: an OpenSource maintained documentation ;) - we will happily  accept PullRequests improving the doc.

We also use nginx in our productive environment in front of the Ditto gateway, but the configuration of that one is of course adjusted to the needs of our commercial offering.

It looks like the used [akka/alpakka](https://github.com/akka/alpakka) mqtt client will try to disconnect / close the connection with its [eclipse/paho.mqtt.java](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java) client. The paho client will create several threads in which it will wait e.g. on the successful send of a disconnect message. The threads however will wait forever and stay alive in the JVM. Since we have no direct access to the client, we should start by removing akka/alpakka to have more control over what happens.

Since connections to MQTT brokers are defined by the user, we have to be highly flexible and need a client that will work well with disconnects, reconnects and use as few threads as possible.
As we can observe remaining threads if a disconnect or close is called on a disconnected / disconnecting paho client it might make sense to have a look at another client like e.g. [hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client). It would also provide an async and a reactive API which would fit much better into our code base.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/450/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Rather than use key(name)/value pairs, it uses the meaningful data as the key name making it difficult to parse with standard packages such as JMESPath and JSONata.

For example, rather than use a keyname of subjectId with a value of the actual subject data, it uses the subjectId as the keyname and it's type as the value. 

Another example, is used in all three resources Thing, Policy and Message where the path is used as the keyname and the permissions as the value.  

In both of the cases listed, you can't use Javascript dot syntax to Get or Set the data. 

Another suggestion is to use arrays of objects for entries, subjects, policy, thing and message enabling the submission of multiple entries each with a different path for instance.

I make these suggestions only with the intention of reducing unnecessary friction for the developer and playing well in the larger ecosystem.

I've included a proposed sample document for review.

Thanks for your interest in this project and feedback on such a crucial feature of Ditto.

When we designed the JSON format we decided on purpose to only include arrays at the ""leaves"" (e.g. for `grant` and `revoke` fields containing arbitrary strings of ""permissions"").
The main reason is that parts of the policy JSON document may be updated/queried partially via the HTTP API, where JSON arrays would not feel very natural (you'd have to use index values of the array in order to address e.g. policy entries instead of a meaningful key).

So e.g. (based in your proposal example) in order to retrieve the permissions on ""features"" level of ""thing"" of the `DEFAULT` policy entry role the HTTP API currently is:
`GET /api/2/policies/namespace:policy-name/entries/DEFAULT/resources/thing:/features`
In your proposal it would be: 
`GET /api/2/policies/namespace:policy-name/entries/0/resources/thing/1`

Not very understandable from the outside. And what happens if the order of the arrays change, e.g. because a new entry is added at the position 0? Then existing code using array identifiers will work on false assumptions.

I see your concerns, I personally don't know JMESPath and JSONata, so that didn't influence the design.

I fear using arrays as schema of Ditto's `Thing` or `Policy` entity is something we will always be skeptical about due to the fact that they would have to be addressed via array index at HTTP API level.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzYwNjg1Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

While I fully appreciate and understand your explanation about having to know and use an index values from array in an api, I'm not suggesting that you change the API. Nor am I suggesting that a developer needs to represent the data structure in code in the same manner as the API or the JSON message sent over the wire. 

All I'm suggesting is that by conforming to a keyname/value structure in JSON over the wire, it is far easier to parse and Get and Set the relevant data.

For example, If I want to set the path for a thing, I should be able to use dot syntax to do so.
policy.admin.resources.thing.path = ""/features"";
In this way, my intention is to set the path for the admin role for the thing to ""/features"";

If I want to retrieve the path, I should also be able use dot syntax to do so,
var mypath = policy.admin.resources.thing.path;

In the current schema, where there is no path property and the path info is part of the key, I can't use dot syntax'

For example,
policy.admin.resources..thing:/features = ...

Oh, but I can't use "":"" and ""/"" in dot syntax so maybe I could try this

policy.admin.resources.['thing:/']..

we'll, while it may not look pretty, it does work as far as retrieving the data, but what if I want to set it.

policy.admin.resources['thing:/features'] = ...
That also works,  while it doesn't replace the existing path, it instead adds a second key.

In any case, this is the only API that presents this kind of problem that I have discovered in the project.

Call me a lazy developer if you like, but I've gotten use to working with JSON as keyname/value pairs, and dot syntax and I much prefer it.

I'm able to work around it with a little pre-processing anyway. 

It just seemed reasonable to centralize the pre-processing on server-side before the message is sent out over the wire and then pre-process it server-side when messages, partial or otherwise come back.

Then the rest of us hopefully large numbers of developers some day won't have to reinvent the wheel every time.

Thanks for this very detailed issue. It's a nice catch and I was able to reproduce this issue thanks to your description.

With a bit of googling I found out that docker client happened to have a similar issue which [was fixed](https://github.com/spotify/docker-client/pull/1033/files) by using also a `KeyFactory` for EC.

In ditto's code base we would need to test multiple key factories in [SSLContextCreator#233](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/connectivity/messaging/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/connectivity/messaging/internal/SSLContextCreator.java#L233), (at least RSA and EC, probably all of the defined ones [in the StandardNames docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#KeyFactory)).

We would be very happy to accept a PR for this one.

I tried cert-less auth against `test.mosquitto.org:1883` which worked. 

My problem was that I used the `tcp://` protocol with certificates. I'd have to use the `ssl://` instead of course. Hence the error `connection reset`.

The question remains to me **why then is it working when a targets array is provided only?**. This gives me a feeling like ""how and why did it work anyway?"". Or let me put it this way: should this ""work""?

A way to avoid this ambiguity is to infer the protocol from the request e.g. using `ssl://` when credentials are provided (and cert-type) and `tcp://` otherwise. Of course it should still accept a custom protocol. For downwards compatibility the uri string should be checked (what it already is) and if the protocol is not specified infer instead of sending back an error.

I also think there should be some more about this in [the docs at uri part](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-connections.html), that highlights the available protocols and in what context they should be used. Currently the only example is with `amqps://` and further information is only available as error-response from the ditto POST command.

I've just tested the install of 1.0.0-M1a on Openshift. I'm installing it using the helm charts.
I have 1 remark about these helm charts and 1 issue:

- Remark: the documentation contains the namespace in the example scripts (https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/tree/master/deployment/helm) I would suggest removing the namespace specification. If you ommit it, it will be installed in the namespace you are currently which should be right most of the time. Right now, I have to adapt these commands to my needs.
- Issue: Both Nginx and Swagger-UI do not have enough permission in openshift. I had to add following specs before the pods started properly: 

> 
          securityContext:
            capabilities: {}
            runAsUser: 0

An example provider featuring claims specifically for authorization purposes is keycloak where you may receive groups and roles assigned to an authenticated user.

According to my conversation with @jokraehe about the OpenID Connect feature it is currently not possible to use other information provided in the JWT then the subject-claim within a policies subject.

Proposal
---

I propose to make it possible via configuration of an OpenID Connect provider in the gateway service to set a different claim as the used subject claim.

1) If the selected claim is a string, it should be used as is.
2) If the selected claim is an array, it should be treated as multiple subjects in a policy.
3) If it's something else it should be ignored an error logged.

I think this would be a fairly easy way of enhancing the OpenID Connect capability without implementing a whole client. The client may follow in a subsequent approach.

Why
---

Being able to use another claim from the JWT increases flexibility and enables different scenarios e.g. role based policy management. It also hands over more control to authorization to the OpenID Connect provider, which in case of keycloak would be a desired state.

What do you guys think?

This is due to the fact that ditto does not implement any concept for authorization on a tenant level.

A way to get this implemented is now given due to the introduction of the OpenID Connect feature. An OpenID Connect provider like keycloak is used, to handle authorization contexts and access-right-management in a central place. In order for applications to work with the set access-rights from the OIDC provider, the used token for authentication may also contain authorization context in the form of claims, that provide more context on the authenticated user.

These claims can be used to implement a configurable authorization for the tenant level, handing the management to the OIDC provider while avoiding the management of policies on a tenant level.

Implementation

The factory `org.eclipse.ditto.services.concierge.starter.proxy.DefaultEnforcerActorFactory` could be a starting point to implement such a feature.

In my understanding the main goal is to support e.g. roles and group claims in subjects such that I may add a OIDC role or group to a policy entry instead of a user id. This would already be much more flexible and allow access management being made from e.g. keycloak instead of ditto policies directly. With this I could write policy entries reflecting roles and add these roles to users to give them more capabilites.

I agree with @ffendt in the sense that in some systems it may be preferable to use e.g. the email instead of the subject e.g. for consistency with other systems.
On the other hand I really lik @w4tsn idea of moving roles or groups in a policy.
Probably the most generic and probably ""simple"" way of achieving that would be to have some kind of ""filters"" which could be added to policies based on metadata that the user could have. So besides the prefix and subject as it is right now we could add a key-value map to the user with attribues. And from oauth we could do a generic mapping e.g. of groups and roles in there so that a filter on ""METADATA[""role_admin""] != null"" (we could use arbitrary engine and syntax here, js, JEXL, ...) would allow all users with oatuh role admin.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODkyMDIyNw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

If I understood @ffendt correctly you could do the same thing by using the subjects.

If I got this idea right, it allows to configure any structure of the subject that will be generated. This means you could for example configure [-sub+][scp] which would then generate the following list of subjects:
```
[
  ""user"",
  ""ffendt+user"",
  ""admin"",
  ""ffendt+admin""
]
```

This way you also have a subject which reflects only the role (admin and user) taken from the scp.

So one of the next steps then is to propose a actual DSL for this then? Some ideas / implementation notes:

As additional note about the nature of claims: they are auth provider dependent and since they are JSON could have any type such as `array, string, boolean, long, int, (nested) object`. Therefore the DSL has to support something like JSON pointer syntax and the value has to be parsed accordingly. E.g. keycloak supports to put a list of attribute values into something like `resource_access.${client_id}.roles`.

If the value of a claim is a list we can assume to use all it's contents for the auth subjects. No need to specify it explicitly with `[...scp]` because it's not useful to specify a certain list entry (the order could be unreliable). We could of course use this to enforce or loosen the claim parsing: allowing a claim to be either string or array or the other way around reject the JWT / claim if it doesn't match the configured type.

I agree on that.

Regarding the DSL: yes, that one would have to be defined. I just searched if there already is a standard/library for defining such things, but I didn't find any.
We could of course use a ""Json transformation"" library like e.g. [Jolt](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/jolt/blob/master/gettingStarted.md), but it's really crazy what that library and its JSON based DSL can do (also crazy difficult to learn).

I guess it would make sense to ""break"" the config format in order to e.g. define for a issuer - so change from plain string to object in the config.

In order to start simple, I would suggest:
* to configure a list of JsonPointers (in `[...]` braces) combined with optional ""static"" characters in between
* if any of the used JsonPointers of one entry can't be resolved/found in the JWT, that complete entry is not added
* each added `[<pointer>]` may be of type string or type array of strings 
   * for type string a single auth subject is extracted
   * for type array of strings multiple auth subjects are extracted

Example config:
```
google = {
  endpoint = ""accounts.google.com""
  auth-subjects-extractors = [
    ""[sub]"",
    ""[sub]+[scp]"",
    ""[sub]+[scp]@[client_id]"",
    ""[sub]+[scp]@[non_existing]"",
    ""[roles/support]""
  ]
}
```

Example token:
```json
{
  ""sub"": ""ffendt"",
  ""client_id"": ""ditto-users"",
  ""scp"": [
    ""user"",
    ""admin""
   ],
  ""roles"": {
    ""support"": [
      ""call-center-agent"",
      ""support.admin""
    ]
  }
}
```

Example extracted auth subjects (to be used in policy ""subjects""):
```
ffendt
ffendt+user
ffendt+admin
ffendt+user@ditto-users
ffendt+admin@ditto-users
call-center-agent
support.admin

My favorit being simply `auth-subjects` since that's what we are looking for to extract from the JWT. This actually gives me another idea: would it be interesting to allow fixed subjects in this list such that one could bind policy entries directly to auth-providers? Not sure how useful this is but we e.g. have a strict realm-per-customer infrastructure where it could potentially become a use-case to give ""basic permissions"" to everything coming from one provider.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwOTM2MzkwMA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Indeed the historical values can be available in the database.
By default they are cleaned up - if not configured otherwise via the environment variable `PERSISTENCE_CLEANUP_ENABLED` available in ""concierge"" service:
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/concierge/starter/src/main/resources/concierge.conf#L78

The historical values are however a ""side effect"" of the persistence approach Ditto uses. It uses Akka Persistence which itself is built on the [Event Sourcing](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence.html#event-sourcing) pattern.
With that pattern there are only inserts done to the database, never updates - that way all changes to e.g. ""things"" managed in Ditto are ""delta changes"" persisted as separate documents in MongoDB.

So when never deleting these old events, the complete history may be available.
As said in #174 Ditto however does not have an API to retrieve those historical values.

There are some challenges in order to get this right:
* the Akka Persistence plugin may return a stream of persisted events for a single thing Id
   * the format of this events is however internal, not supposed to be API
   * they could however be transformed to ""Ditto Protocol"" messages which are public API
* so APIs would have to be defined
   * in HTTP and Ditto Protcol (e.g. via WebSocket, AMQP 1.0, etc.)
* authorization would have to be specified/clarified
   * e.g.: which authenticated user/system is allowed to see historical values? is that defined in the policy? is ""READ"" from the policy sufficient?
   * or even: must the configured authorization at the time where a historical entry was added be the one to apply for accessing the historical event?
* the event history would have to be streamed in the cluster message by message

So there are quite a few things to do.
And to be honest: the team does not have that on the Ditto agenda, so we would rely on contributions.

And I don't know if this would really help you solve your problem. That would not at all be comparable with a timeseries database like InfluxDB.
The max. you would get from this API is for one or several things a stream of change events - without any aggregation or statistic calculation.
Is that something which would help you?

What probably could be interesting for you is the recently added ""HTTP Push"" connectivity feature (https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2019-10-17-http-connectivity.html) which lets you invoke a custom HTTP endpoint e.g. for each ""twin event"" which was done.
In combination with JavaScript based payload transformation you could probably get rid of your ""custom service"" between Ditto and InfluxDB and directly push data in a normalized form via HTTP to the InfluxDB API.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDI5Mzc1OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

we are also currently looking into a) how to feed data to Influx for persistence and b) extracting it again, considering the policy. 

In my opionion, the two biggest issues are:
- proper mapping, i.e. how to relate the fields / tags to the ditto model. 
  Given that we have our things definitions in vorto, we are using the `measurementUnit` to define the name of the measurement the values should be written to in Influx. Every data point is tagged with the thingId as well as the path of the data point.

- handle access to the data as Influx does not support policies. 
  Initially, we were considering to provide the policy as an additional tag. However, the policy could change over time. Furthermore, this will be much more difficult to implement if you are using Flux as query-language as oppsed to InfluxQL.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjAzMzU1MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I don't believe that eg InfluxDB or any other conventional time series database is a good fit for massive sensor data.

IoTDB might be worth looking into.

@demetz I think somehow making the authorization via policies work with ts data would be the hardest thing to solve.

What I once thought of: just store the ""read subjects"" of an thing Event as tags to each ts document.
The ""read subjects"" is a list of policy subjects allowed to read an event (eg thing modified) and is already available for each event in Ditto.
That way a query to the time series database could always include a ""where clause"" selecting the ""Auth subjects"" (authenticated subjects, eg a username) and the ts db would only return authorized datasets.

That Approach however would require Ditto to have a deep understanding and integration of a timeseries db.
That is currently not on the project's agenda, but we're open for contributions. :wink:
But first a good fit timeseries db would have to be agreed on.

I come from IoTDB community.  Lukas Ott and Julian Feinhauer told me about Ditto. 

Indeed in one of our practice, we tried to use an IoTDB instance to manage ～ 600 devices with 6000 metrics (i.e., totally 3.6M time series) with 5Hz data ingestion per time series (i.e., 3.6M*5 points per second). Actually, we tried 800 devices X 8000 metrics, it also works.  All metrics generate float or boolean data.

However, we used a server which has 128GB memory (-Xmx100g) and an Intel XEON E5 CPU and HDD disk.  (Using such a hardware, IoTDB can reach ~ 30Million points per second ingestion throughput, using batch_write api.)

We also tried to manage timeseries with high collection frequency, e.g., 500KHz per time series. 
If we use batch_write api, e.g., write 100 points per api calling, we can support such a high frequency data collection. 

Of course IoTDB can also run on a Raspberry PI. But I did not test how many time series it can support on such a 2GB memory machine (maybe 20K~100K time series is fine.)

I do not know what scenario that Ditto wants to support and which kind of hardware that Ditto wants to run on. Hope the above info can help us to evaluate whether IoTDB is suitable.

Besides, IoTDB can support a good query performance for a time range query. (Indeed we are improving our query performance and may finish it in 0.10 or 0.11).  A known issue is that if there are too many data in IoTDB's memory, the query may be slower than the data on disk for some kinds of queries (very strange, right? It is a design problem, and may be solved in future).

One thing you need to know is that IoTDB's schema is quite different with InfluxDB. we have a concept of Storage Group, which impacts the write performance and memory cost heavily.

 A good thing is that as IoTDB is written in Java, it is glad to find Ditto is also written in Java that can make the integration easier.

Major Drawback is the management of different Users at different points (MQTT, Ditto, IoTDB). So I would be highly interested in creating a service in ditto which ""proxies"" all timeseries requests and applies its security context / policy.

@thjaeckle could you see something like that as a ditto feature? And if so, where would be a good starting point from your perspective?

The components involved are Eclipse Vorto, A Micro-Service serving the two purposes for storing and retrieving history, influxdb, an MQTT-5 connector and a special, configurable proxy serving the actual data from the db.

In our solution the history is managed through a micro-service connected to ditto via websockets which has two main purposes: get incoming changes to the digital twin, store it in influxdb and listen to ditto messages to retrieve data from influxdb.

In order to **not** send big historical queries through ditto (which fails due to limits, is slow due to missing compression etc.) the historian places a query in a configurable proxy with access to influxdb and returns only a temporary link with a Status Code of 303. This way the client can request history under it's policy restrictions through ditto while being able to get high performant queries (almost) directly from influxdb.

Access control is managed mainly through ditto policies. The policy controls what the historian may store through permissions on features:/. Any client via ditto is restricted via policies in the way what history it may retrieve. The historian stores incoming twin changes with their thingid, namespace and property path. With the explicit and implicit information known from the websocket connection the historian may handle requests as intended by the policies. E.g. explicit are thingid and propertyPath and implicit is where the ditto policy allows a subject to send messages to. For deeper application of policies we may incorporate the Policy API and even read policy objects from ditto. MQTT5 allows us to restrict gateways to only write data to things they should via their client ids which is not possible with MQTT3. 

We try to maintain every twin related access through ditto so we can relay on dittos policy framework. Either we query features from a thing or we get additional functionality like the history by additional micro-services answering ditto messages.

I hope this already helps with the issue and gives another idea about practical usage of history and ditto :)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDcxMjc4Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That is really clever. Kudos to that solution.

Could Ditto make this easier in any way?
Basically what @JulianFeinauer thought about as well, eg providing a specific history API. 

Relaying the payload through Ditto is really something which should be prevented here, so the redirect to a temporary URL is great.


It would be great to document this as some kind of ""Pattern"" or best practice for integrating 3rd party aspects of a digital twin via Ditto, still ensuring authorization.

From my experience I would affirm both questions. A simple solution to this would be to use the policy at timestamp x when getting the data of a thing at timestamp x (e.g. simplified by adding the read subjects to the historical entry of things as @thjaeckle assumed).

I could write a first draft down in a PR and you may move it to a section of your choosing in the docs and enrich it with more details from your perspective. I wanted to write something for my blog anyways :)

Regarding an enhancement of the API from Ditto I'll have a coffee about it and talk with my frontend engineers if they have any 'desires' in that regards :+1: 

Regarding policies and historical access, here is my current perspective:

Writing policy information as metadata onto a series is often times also not reversible (in an easy way) and probably also not desired. This implicates that a specific access state is known at write time of the datapoint and will never change in the future. So in order to later change access permissions of a series one would have to change the subjects of 'historical policies'. That means we'd have to store the history of policies, but allow a change of subjects them. Correct me, if I'm wandering off somewhere... @JulianFeinauer I think with additional series in iotdb it's the same? I'm not familiar with iotdbs mechanics so I struggling to understand the implications of separate series per policy. Maybe you could elaborate about that a bit more?

Having policies with an optional timestamp extension for historical data feels much more natural to me, since the policy then is always a current perspective, which may grant/revoke access to the history from a somewhat elevated position.

@ffendt in our scenario, currently, a user either has access to the history or not. There currently are no plans to further restrict this on a per timestamp basis, but who knows when the next feature request comes in. I'm however open for ideas and besides that this topic is quite fascinating.

Oh, and regarding the messages we use @JulianFeinauer:

Indeed we use ditto messages over the live channel with arbitrary payloads which are captured, processed and answered by the micro-service. The payloads (as JSON) are what actually defines the parameters of the query (without the tags, db names and measurements required for authorization). @thjaeckle I suppose that this is one of the things that would be moved to a HTTP API, instead of using loose payloads.

Yes, IoTDB does not support add additional ""tags"" for a part of data in a series now. (e.g., add a tag ""alert"" on the data from timestamp x to y in series A).  But I have already been considering the feature, not for permission, but for add some useful information on series data to enrich the query semantic. 
So, if you have more requirement definition about tag on subseries, you can share to me and let's make this feature taking more effect.

Agree to use Ditto to control the permission.
Actually, IoTDB itself has permission control, i.e., allowing a user to read or write on a given time series.  However, database user is totally different with the terminal user (or, client).  A database usually has several users (DBA, user1, user2 etc..), while we may have millions of terminal users (clients).

My current understanding is that my microservice defines message types / topics it is able to process and registers these to ditto such that a dynamic swagger doc is updated / added that shows new REST endpoints for certain things. Both updated REST API endpoints and an according swagger doc would be really neat.

Currently the micro-service just opens a WS connection and handles all the API logic which messages are actually excepted and processed locally. By the design of the WS and policy it receives all messages it is allowed to read and ditto currently has no idea about what the service is capable of. Right now I communicate the functionality on a separate channel to the developers.

I've opened issue #682 to track this idea.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzk2NTcxNw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Discussion
---

**user properties and header mapping** are the way a client may provide additional header values in MQTT 5. Additional to the user properties, there are fixed and variable properties available. I had a look at the EMQX Broker for a reference of available properties. These are among others `Correlation Data`, `Response Topic` and `Content Type`. Those can be implemented as general available headers for header mapping.

User defined properties for targets can be defined via the specific Configs map in the connections configuration.

**Source Enforcement** for the time being I have no clear idea how to implement the source enforcement. MQTT 5 provides a property `Authentication Method` together with `Authentication Data`. This does not apply for publish and other message types however. 

Question: The clientid is already extracted and some brokers enforce the client id via certificate based authentication. Is this enough to have a first source enforcement?

Additionally to this, the broker would require the ability to set user defined properties per message right? Since the user defined properties are the only headers that are valid for all message types.

**Validator and MQTT5Config?** Is it necessary to have these classes separate from mqtt3? The validator currently has a hard check for `MQTT 3.1.1` in the protocol param. Should there be just an extension for `MQTT 5` or a separate validator? What do you think?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/547/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

First of all thank you for start working on the MQTT5 support, that will be a great enhancement 👍 

For your discussion points:
**user properties and header mapping**: yes, makes perfect sense using the pre-defined and user-properties for header mappings in connection sources and targets.
I guess that the HiveMQ mqtt5 client has special setters/getters for the pre-defined properties (like `Content Type`, `Correlation Data` or `Response Topic`) and that those are not duplicated in the `user properties` with e.g. keys ""content-type"" ...
We have a similar challenge in the Amqp10 connection - there we use the Qpid-Jms-Client which also defines methods like `setJmsCorrelationId`. There we want to just use ""correlation-id"" as key in a header mapping.
We solved that by ""mapping"" header keys to methods to be invoked on a `Message` instance, see here:
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/connectivity/messaging/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/connectivity/messaging/amqp/AmqpPublisherActor.java#L79

We should do the same for the MQTT5 implementation, defining that header keys ""correlation-id"", ""content-type"", ""reply-to"" are mapped to MQTT5 `Correlation Data` , `Content Type` and `Response Topic`.
We are currently working on #540 which will solve that more elegant for AMQP 1.0 header mappings, we will get a WIP PR out so that you may use the same pattern.

**Source Enforcement**: The idea of source enforcement is to extract information towards the device identity from each consumed message (in order to ensure that the targeted thing in the Ditto Protocol message has the same identifier as the device which sent the message). Eclipse Hono for example sets the `device_id` header for each message.
I also don't see a default defined property for that in the MQTT5 properties. 
As you suggested that could however be done via user defined properties. Preferably done by the broker, yes - otherwise the device could still pretend to be another device.

What we suggest for MQTT 3 here is to use the MQTT topic as source of the device id (see also placeholder `{{ source:address }}` documented here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-connections.html#source-enforcement
So an enforcement could look like:
```
{
  ""addresses"": [ ""my-mqtt-root-topic/+"" ],
  ""authorizationContext"": [""ditto:inbound-auth-subject""],
  ""enforcement"": {
    ""input"": ""{{ source:address }}"",
    ""filters"": [ ""my-mqtt-root-topic/{{ thing:id }}"" ]
  }
}
```
Under the assumption that a device always sends data to `my-mqtt-root-topic/<device-id>` and the broker enforces (e.g. via ACL in Mosquitto) that only that device may publish data to that topic.

I would also suggest that approach for MQTT5 - or alternatively get the broker to set a `device_id` header :)

**Validator and MQTT5Config**: The validator should be re-usable for MQTT5, yes.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDg4NzYyOA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The idea is to use an [RQL filter](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-rql.html) in order to specify a ""condition"" when doing modifying API calls (e.g. a PUT on a thing via HTTP).

For HTTP the condition could be added as query param, e.g.:
```
PUT /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:my-fancy-car-1/features/temperature/properties/value?condition=ne(features/temperature/properties/value,23.9)

body: 23.9
```
In words the above would mean:
> Only update the temperature value when it was changed from the value I provide: 23.9

With a more advanced JSON structure this can also enable conditional updates based on timestamps, e.g. when choosing the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-fancy-car-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-fancy-car-1"",
  ""features"": {
    ""temperature"": {
      ""properties"": {

        ""timestamp"": ""2019-11-26T09:05:32Z""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You are able to formulate a condition which takes the last modification ""timestamp"" into accout, e.g.:
```
PUT /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:my-fancy-car-1/features/temperature/properties/value?condition=lt(features/temperature/properties/timestamp,""2019-11-26T09:00:32Z"")

In fact there is an option to do that already.
The header ""x-ditto-dummy-auth"" may contain a pre authenticated subject eg injected by a nging proxy server.
While this was originally intended for development, the header name is still strange.

So e.g. when only a temperature is updated (this is the Ditto Protocol message):
```json
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/my-fancy-car/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""path"": ""/features/temperature/properties/status/value"",
  ""value"": 23.5

Then a change event will only include exactly that information, as Ditto Protocol message:
```json
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/my-fancy-car/things/twin/events/modified"",
  ""path"": ""/features/temperature/properties/status/value"",
  ""value"": 23.5
}
```

There are however cases when there should be more information added to that event, e.g. when some additional metadata is needed when the event is processed.

In such cases it would of course work to do a HTTP GET on the Ditto HTTP API in order to fetch that additional information, but that causes additional roundtrips and additional latency which could be avoided.

So we would like to add the possibility to specify a further [field selector](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-concepts.html#with-field-selector) of additional thing data to select for all channels we send change notifications on:
* WebSocket
* Server Sent Events (SSEs)
* all connectivity types (AMQP, MQTT, ...)

For WebSocket that could e.g. look like:
```
START-SEND-EVENTS?extraFields=attributes,features/location
```

The actual change should/could be ""merged"" with the additionally selected fields, so the resulting Ditto Protocol events could look like:
```json
{
""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/my-fancy-car/things/twin/events/modified"",
""path"": ""/features/temperature/properties/status/value"",
""value"": 23.5,

We could cache Things at the Ditto ""edges"" (gateway, connectivity services).
Apply a similar approach to the policy cache in concierge:
* use the Caffeine cache + cache loader in order to load non resolved Things
* the Caffeine cache has to be scoped to a single connection or session
   * scoped to an ""auth subject"" and configured `extraFields`
* for the first event, when the ""enhanced Thing"" is not yet in the cache:
   * load the Thing with `extraFields` via concierge
   * save the result in the cache
   * enhance the data from the event
   * the cache entry needs to be aware of the Thing revision
* for all following events:
   * check if the revision number of the event is the expected ""next one"" compared to the cached Thing
      * if yes: 
         * all data is available, no further ""retrieve"" required --> enhance the fields from the cache
         * do also update the cached Thing with the data from the event
         * increse revision number by 1
      * if no: 
         * apparently the connection/session missed an event
         * remove the cache entry and load it again via cache loader

For the ""happy path"" case (which should happen >99% of the time), only very few additional roundtrips are required.

Ditto needs some more memory consumption at the edges which should however be much better than additional cluster roundtrips.

Only problem with that approach:
* Policy changes might cause that the enriched Thing is not seen the way it should be 
   * that could be fixed by subscribing also for Policy of the Thing's Policy
   * additionally the cache entry could be evicted after a fix amount of time","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjI4MzMxOQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

First problem I encountered was, that I had to split the script up into things and policies scripts and run them on the respective databases, since the script itself would otherwise just run on test. I suppose it's written for a one-database-for-all scenario? In the docker-compose scenario however, each service uses it's own db in the mongodb instance. That's actually the way the script of the initial commit for the script works (which is not linked in the release notes).

Overall I was quite confused on how this migration works honestly.

My setup
---

I started using ditto at version 0.8.0 and did a migration on 0.9.0. It could be that I failed in doing so correctly which caused the collections `_journal` and `_snaps` to already exist. 

I dropped `things.things_journal`, `things.things_snaps`, `policies.policies_journal` and `policies.policies_snaps` before running this migration, so the migration would work. Propably the indexes, although not shown, were/are still there? The strange thing now is, that the index `journal_tag_index` seems to exist, but is not shown when executing `_journal.getIndexes()`.

Workaround
---

In my case I removed the 'journal_tag_index' index from `things.things_journal` and `policies.policies_journal` respectively.

Implementation
---

I'm not sure yet and quite insecure if this is just a quirk in my setup or a general problem which would require a broader discussion and real solution.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/576/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The script is fixed in #577. Yes, dropping `journal_tag_index` should fix the issue; I forgot to create it ""sparse"". The script should definitely account for or at least document the case of multi-database setup.

The script copies all documents in suffixed event journals and snapshot stores.

Since `mapReduce` produces documents in a fixed format not compatible with the persistence plugin, a follow-up aggregation step is needed to fix the document format.

We already had a look at GraphQL.

And as Ditto does not ""know""/""enforce"" a data schema to the managed things (only stuff like ""attributes"", ""features"" is part of the given Ditto schema) and the user may use arbitrary JSON, with GraphQL there would be the need to always provide a GraphQL schema first prior in doing the powerful queries. That's why I personally think it's too complicated and the benefits from it are too few in order to be of value to the Ditto project.

What you describe with ""over- and underfetching of Data"" is already handled in Ditto quite well, see:
* [Partial updates](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-concepts.html#partial-updates)
* [Partial requests](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-concepts.html#partial-requests)
* [Partial requests with ""fields"" selector](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-concepts.html#with-field-selector)

Based on those concepts, Ditto will further improve on data retrival.
E.g. currently we are working on #561 which will make use of the ""fields"" selector syntax in order to include additional data when e.g. publishing change notifications via WebSocket or connections to brokers.

For what - in addition to the mentioned capabilities of partial updates/responses - do you think a GraphQL API would be helpful for Ditto?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDE0Mjc1NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The Partial requests is and [https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/issues/561](url) was exactly the questions I had.

So GraphQL API would as you answered not be needed and would just produce a lot of development effort which would not have more benefits compared to the existing partial request handling.

https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/tree/master/services/connectivity/messaging/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/connectivity/messaging/kafka

There we need:
* a `KafkaConsumerActor` extending `BaseConsumerActor`
* this consumer must be started in `KafkaClientActor.startConsumerActors(ClientConnected)` (protected class to be overwritten)
* have to think about consumer offset management (where and how to persist offsets)

The existing consumers for other protocols should give a good example on what needs to be implemented in the consumer:
* [AmqpConsumerActor](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/connectivity/messaging/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/connectivity/messaging/amqp/AmqpConsumerActor.java)

The Ditto team has the Kafka consumer topic on its short- to mid-term agenda - as Eclipse Hono now also supports Kafka since the just released version 1.6, that will be the future of connecting Ditto and Hono.

I am however not yet sure if the Kafka consumer will make it in the upcoming Ditto 2.0 release (which we target for March/April).

this issue was initially raised by @ottlukas and he was asking if it could be possible to store ""telemetry"" data in Apache IoTDB (http://iotdb.apache.org/ / https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb).
I agree on that with Lukas, especially if one has features / properties that sends updates with high frequency (seconds or subsecond frequency).
I guess one could stay on MongoDB for long (as it can scale) but at what price if one is often interested, e.g. in showing the graph of a property as timeseries.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/592/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It seems to me that Ditto uses event sourcing and the database which could be moved to IoTDB is the journals database.
Although I think the full functionality cannot easily migrated to IoTDB (as it stores lots of metadata) one could think about a ""replication"" of that collection to an IoTDB instance which is then used, e.g. for visualization in grafana or other things.
Then one could even get rid of this collection or clear it (if one keeps the snapshots) and still have full ""telemetry"" informtaion.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzQyNDA0NQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Replacing MongoDB with IoTDB will not work, We use MongoDB as
* EventSourcing journal
* EventSourcing snapshot store
* Index for Ditto's search feature

So in order to get Ditto with minimal dependencies, a DB would have to cover all of these.
I don't see that IoTDB is a match for that as it focuses on time series.

What could make more sense is what we started discussing in #545 
Ditto currently can't deliver history for its ""thing data"". For that it would be very cool to build e.g. a facade to IoTDB with Ditto where Ditto still enforces authorization, API access, etc.

That could also be what you meant with ""replication"" of the data which would be a best practive for CQRS which we also apply e.g. for our search index.
A new ""ditto-history"" microservice could subscribe to `ThingEvent`s in Ditto's cluster (those are the ones you saw in the event journal collection) and for each event update all of the affected datapoints in an IoTDB instance.
It would also enabled querying the data from IoTDB making sure that only authorized users (via Ditto's policies) have access to the historical data.

Does this make sense?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzUzNzY1Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have no idea whats going on and if this might be a general problem of the cluster degrading over time or if it's just my setup that is screwed up.

This error is accompanied by a lot of time out error throughout the cluster.

The gateway server is responding with `No response within server request timeout (<PT1M>), shutting actor down.` and nginx follows with 503 for the original PUT request.

The things service emitts strange messages with type SudoStreamModifiedEntities and start and end dates somewhere in 2001.

What is also alarming is a mongodb error thrown in the things service `IndexOptionsConflict: things_snaps_index already exists with different options`

I noticed that it started working again after some time this morning after a reboot. I had to wait a couple of minutes until the error messages dissapeared and the cluster seemed to work properly. Then after another reboot later this day, the cluster started having problems again and did not recover ever since.

The error messages supplied below are a reoccuring pattern.

**Edit 1:** after about 10 to 30 Minutes the cluster seems to catch itself and works again. When restarting it then takes a lot of time again for the system to recover a stable state.

Setup / Environment
---

docker-compose based setup.

Ditto version 1.0.0, official images

Slight configuration changes in message-max-size and akka buffer sizes.

The cluster started at ditto 0.8.0 and lived through two database migrations, which I applied as stated in the documentation.

I had problems with the migration from 0.9.0 to 1.0.0, hence applying the operations manually based off of the supplied script in the documentation. It worked out for several months until now.

The VM running the docker-compose setup has 16 Gig of RAM and 4 CPUs. Ditto raises the CPU load15 to around 5 on average and 8 on startup.

That index exception `Index with name: things_snaps_index already exists with different options` sounds really strange.
Did you try dropping the index `things_snaps_index`? It should be automatically recreated.

That could in fact cause the timeout exception you are seeing in the logs.

Is your Docker for windows configured to share drives?
I don't use Docker for windows any longer but as far as I remember you can/must configure to e.g. Share your C drive with Docker.

If that doesn't help: the swagger ui isn't mandatory, so you could remove it from the Docker Compose file.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDcxMTA5Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Are there any plans in place to fix these issues by upgrading?

I changed the title as these ""security vulnerabilities"" do no affect Ditto and are therefore no ""security vulnerabilities"". 
E.g.: CVE-2019-20444, CVE-2019-20445, CVE-2019-16869, CVE-2020-7238 all relate to ""HTTP request smuggling"" in Netty.
As Ditto doesn't use Netty for serving HTTP requests or as HTTP client - but only for AMQP 1.0 connections - this does not affect us.

The ""Sonatype"" ones seems to not exist (both ""doesn't appear to be a valid
Sonatype Vulnerability Identifier""):
https://my.sonatype.com/nexus-intelligence/sonatype-2018-0590
https://my.sonatype.com/nexus-intelligence/sonatype-2020-0029

Do you have more information on them?

Regarding Netty: In the meantime we already updated to latest Netty 4.1.48 which should have addressed the known CVEs.
The upcoming Ditto 1.1.0 will be released in ~2 weeks containing this Netty version.

Thanks for your confirm, very happy to know that we will have Ditto 1.1.0 in the coming weeks.

As I just looked up in the detail report, here is the description for Sonatype ones:

sonatype-2020-0029 | The netty-codec package is vulnerable to a   Denial of Service (DoS). The decode method in JdkZlibDecoder.class,   JZlibDecoder.class, and JZlibDecoder.class do not limit the eventual size of   a compressed buffer after it is decompressed. Consequently, a malicious   request can consume much more memory on a server than the size of the request   would imply. An attacker can exploit this behavior by sending many such   requests, resulting in a DoS situation.
-- | --
sonatype-2018-0590 | The rhino package is vulnerable to XML eXternal Entity Reference (XXE)   attacks. The toXml method in XmlProcessor.class does not properly enforce any   protections against external entities when parsing XML. An attacker can   exploit this vulnerability by using crafted XML data which when evaluated by   the package, causes XXE attacks.

Hope these information can be helpful for you.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzg0NTI3OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I suppose the typo is not in your actual configuration ;) Apart from that I don't think it'll work to use an ssl connection to the non-ssl endpoint on 1883. At least it should not as I understand it.

From the documentation I read that

Which sounds pretty mandatory to me. Not sure about that.

That said, I don't yet understand why it worked before 1.0.0 and now it doesn't. Can you provide more context?

if considering using some kind of History API (see #545 ) it gets more and more relevant to know the timestamp of a specific value from a thing. Also in scenarios where you have no direct connection like HTTP / WS but have messaging involved like MQTT or generally Hono you can not rely that the timestamp when you receive an update message is roughly equivalent to the timestamp when it was measured. 

I thus suggest to enable explicit support for ""last_modified"" timestamp which could be either set explicitly in the message or implicitly with the ""ingestion time"" and which is then available for a possible history service and for users to see how ""valid"" their datasets are.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/680/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Basically each ""leaf"" in the JSON gets an JsonObject containing additional meta information.
That could also be aggregated upwards, so in the provided example above you would know that the ""lamp"" feature is also of revision `42` last modified at the timestamp `14:30`.

I would also want to see the ""revision"" as meta information at a property level, so that you can e.g. see (like in Subversion) which revision a part of the subtree of a Thing or even a single property has.
But that may be a topic for another issue. :)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTM0OTkxMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Cool, I think this would a great addition to Ditto without breaking existing functionality.

The best way I can think of is to enhance the [AbstractThingEventStrategy](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/things/persistence/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/things/persistence/actors/strategies/events/AbstractThingEventStrategy.java#L49) to - in addition to the already set ""setRevision(long)"" and ""setModified(Instant)"" also invoke something like `setMetadata(JsonPointer, Metadata)`.
At the mentioned spot you have the `ThingEvent` containing which `JsonPointer getResourcePath()` was affected (which you need in order to set the `Metadata` information on the right JSON ""level""), containing the `Optional<JsonValue> getEntity()` and also containing `DittoHeaders getDittoHeaders()` (which might e.g. include the ""actual device modification timestamp"" - propsal: `""_issuedAt""` - which could be a different one).

Having found that place, additional things are needed to be implemented:
* the `ThingBuilder`s (`ThingBuilder.FromCopy` and `ThingBuilder.FromScratch`) need to be enhanced by setting the new additional ""meta"" information
* we would need a new type (Interface + immutable implementation) e.g. `Metadata` in package `org.eclipse.ditto.model.base.entity`
** the `Metadata` interface would define (with an inner subclass for the `JsonFields`) which metadata information can be expected and which Json+Java type this metadata has - for example please have a look at `Thing.JsonFields`
* the `org.eclipse.ditto.model.base.entity.Entity` needs to be enhanced by a getter and setter for this ""Metadata"" instance (I would add that on `Entity` rather than on `Thing` so that the `Policy` also being an `Entity` might also benefit from that)
* the `Thing.JsonFields` needs to be enhanced by a new constant for the `""_metadata""` JSON field
* the `ImmutableThing`'s `JsonObject toJson(JsonSchemaVersion, Predicate<JsonField>)` needs to write the new ""_meta"" field when serializing a Thing Java object to JSON
* the `ImmutableThingFromCopyBuilder of(JsonObject)` needs to read the ""_meta"" field when deserializing to a Thing Java object again from JSON
* I also think we need to enhance the `DittoHeaderDefinition` with a special header specifying the modification timestamp coming from a device
** then, also `DittoHeaders`, `DittoHeadersBuilder` and the implementations need to be adjusted accordingly (incl. JSON serialization)

Do you need that new meta information also in each Event emitted via Ditto (I guess so)?
Then the `org.eclipse.ditto.signals.events.base.Event` would need to be enhanced with that ""Metadata"" information as well, as well as serialization to JSON and deserialization back to Java objects in the implementations responsible for JSON serialization (e.g. in `AbstractThingEvent`).

Those are the first things popping into my mind.
That might seem a lot but I think this is a rather low hanging fruit - the main effort is in enhancing the Ditto ""model"" around Entity/Thing by adding the `Metadata` type and to enhance the ""Event"" as well.

Making the ""_metadata"" field in the `Thing.JsonFields` a `FieldType.SPECIAL, FieldType.HIDDEN` field (like e.g. also `""_modified""`, the field will not by default be returned when retrieving a Thing via the HTTP API - it should work automatically then to provide a ""fields"" query in order to retrieve that information, e.g.:
`GET /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:thing-1?fields=policyId,features,_revision,_metadata`

> And I think we should also try to differentiate two things: date of last modification and timestamp of the value (which may be the same but maybe totally different also)
Yes, maybe we can provide a ""_modified"" field and in addition an optional ""_issuedAt"" field.
If both are the same, it is sufficient to only set the ""_modified"" - if they differ, both values are set in the created instance of `Metadata`.
The `Optional<Instant> getIssuedAt()` in `Metadata` interface would indicate that by using an `Optional` return type.

* hidden by default (e.g. when doing a GET request)
* and are read only by default (and always set by Ditto only)

Having thought about it a while I see this variant which might ease things up:
* keep `_metadata` and as a result make everything in it read only
* have specific metadata fields which Ditto automatically sets (currently: `_revision` and `_modified`)
* define a prefix for header fields which should be added by Ditto into the _metadata section, e.g.: `ditto-metadata:`
   * by default, a set metadata value is applied to all JSON leaves affected by a modifying command, e.g.: `ditto-metadata:issuedAt`
   * similar to policy resources, the ditto-metadata could contain an optional JsonPointer of which property to address the metadata value to if a metadata value should not be applied to all affected JSON fields of a processed command


Example headers when modifying a complete thing (`ModifyThing` command - [example](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-examples-modifything.html#modifything)):
```json
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/thing-1/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""headers"": {

    ""ditto-metadata:/features/lamp/properties/color/b/issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:14:00Z""
  },
  ""path"": ""/"",
  ""value"": {
    ""features"": {
      ""lamp"": {
        ""properties"": {
          ""on"": false,
          ""color"": {
            ""r"": 255,
            ""g"": 255,
            ""b"": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Another example for modifying the feature properties of a thing (`ModifyFeatureProperties` command - [example](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-examples-modifyproperties.html#modifyfeatureproperties):
```json
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/thing-1/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""headers"": {
    ""ditto-metadata:issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:29:00Z"",
    ""ditto-metadata:/color/r/issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:14:00Z"",
    ""ditto-metadata:/color/g/issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:14:00Z"",
    ""ditto-metadata:/color/b/issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:14:00Z""
  },
  ""path"": ""/features/lamp/properties"",
  ""value"": {
    ""on"": false,
    ""color"": {
      ""r"": 255,
      ""g"": 255,
      ""b"": 0
    }
  }
}
```

The resulting JSON for both of the above commands would e.g. look like:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:thing-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""..."",
  ""features"": {
    ""lamp"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""on"": true,
        ""color"": {
          ""r"": 0,
          ""g"": 255,          
          ""b"": 255,
        }
      }
    }
  },
  ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:30:00Z"",
  ""_revision"": 42,
  ""_metadata"": {
    ""policyId"": {
      ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:00:00Z"",
      ""_revision"": 1
    },
    ""features"": {
      ""lamp"": {
        ""properties"": {
          ""on"": {
            ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:30:00Z"",
            ""_revision"": 42,
            ""issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:29:00Z""
          },
          ""color"": {
            ""r"": {
              ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:30:00Z"",
              ""_revision"": 42,
              ""issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:14:00Z""
            },
            ""g"": {
              ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:30:00Z"",
              ""_revision"": 42,
              ""issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:14:00Z""
            },
            ""b"": {
              ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:30:00Z"",
              ""_revision"": 42,
              ""issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:14:00Z""
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I think that would support the principle: ""Make simple things simple, make complex things possible.
* the ""simple things"": by adding a single header, e.g. `""ditto-metadata:issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:29:00Z""` all affected JSON keys in the command will get that same metadata information
* the ""complex things"": if that is not sufficient, a header for each differing metadata field can be added

Assuming a command modifies a complete thing (`ModifyThing` command) like the following:
```
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/thing-1/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""headers"": {
    ""ditto-metadata:issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:29:00Z"",
    ...
  },
  ""path"": ""/"",
  ""value"": {
    ""features"": {
      ""lamp"": {
        ""properties"": {
          ""on"": false,
          ""color"": {
            ""r"": 255,
            ""g"": 255,
            ""b"": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Then the value of ""issuedAt"" would be applied to all feature properties, i. e. `on`, `r`, `g`, `b`.
This way it is impossible to set a metadata value exclusively at the root level (`/`), i. e. the thing itself.

How about a syntax which allows to determine the level more specifically?
**Example one:**
```
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/thing-1/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""headers"": {
    ""ditto-metadata:issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:29:00Z"",
    ...
  },
  ""path"": ""/"",
  ""value"": {
    ""features"": {
      ""lamp"": {
        ""properties"": {
          ""on"": false,
          ""color"": {
            ""r"": 255,
            ""g"": 255,
            ""b"": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example one is interpreted in a way to set the value of ""issuedAt"" only at the root level (path `/`).

**Example two:**
```
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/thing-1/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""headers"": {
    ""ditto-metadata:*/issuedAt"": ""2020-06-09T14:29:00Z"",
    ...
  },
  ""path"": ""/"",
  ""value"": {
    ""features"": {
      ""lamp"": {
        ""properties"": {
          ""on"": false,
          ""color"": {
            ""r"": 255,
            ""g"": 255,
            ""b"": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In example two the asterisk implies that the value of ""issuedAt"" should be applied to all the affected JSON leaves, in this case `on`, `r`, `g` and `b`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NjI4NDE4OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Tests showed however, that there is a problem: HTTP headers are not allowed to contain slashes or colons. Thus the syntax of the metadata header should be changed.

I already had a discussion with @thjaeckle regarding this issue. We think that it would be best to change the syntax of metadata header as follows:

Header name: `metadata` as the prefix `ditto-` implies that it cannot be set externally but only internally by Ditto itself.
Header value: `PATH=VALUE` where `PATH` is either a regular JSON Pointer or a ""wildcard path"" like for example `/*/issuedAt`. `VALUE` is a valid JSON value. Multiple metadata key-value pairs are separated by a comma `,`.

A HTTP header for setting metadata could look as follows – the leading slash (`/`) of the paths is optional:

    metadata: /*/issuedAt=""2020-06-09T14:29:00Z"",/color/r/someCounter=23

This approach has the advantage that `metadata` could become a well-known `DittoHeaderDefinition` as it is no longer just a prefix.

To the following JSON Object. After this parsing we can't get the initial path `/features/lamp/properties/color/r` anymore
```
{
  ""features"": {
    ""lamp"": {

---

A micro-service providing certain additional functionality to a thing, e.g. managing historical time series data, is registered to ditto via e.g. websockets and processes certain messages send to digital twins. A client application may now send messages to a thing to get it's history. For this to work it has to know what messages exist, what parameters they expect and what the response looks like. Typical API knowledge.

Currently this knowledge has to be managed outside the ecosystem with a third-party application / channel.

Basic Idea
---

A micro-service may use a descriptive interface to ditto to share it's capabilities in a way that ditto may serve dynamic REST endpoints according to the specification of the service.

Further Thoughts
---

It would be handy to have also a dynamic swagger doc reflecting addtional functionality.

Ditto should cache this registered API and also provide means to integrate this into health check requests.

Great idea! I will prepare something next week.

Let me add some more thoughts / bit of rephrasing what I have in mind. Basically this is about the possibility to provide our own ""custom"" services in a transparent way which would also allow us to provide them in other languages and runtimes.

In our specific use-case we added a micro-service providing our custom history API. We want to have this API simply be available through ditto messages and secured by the policy framework of ditto. Our frontend developers however want to have a typical REST API with Swagger docs. Of course they can use the generic REST API for ditto messages, but this is not really an expressive way of exposing our API.

Right now we communicate the API capabilities in a separate document in our own ""swagger-ish"" language which is a bit of a pain in the *** for both sides - especially because API spec is an already solved problem so to speak. The micro-service expects certain ditto message topics, fields in the messages payload etc.

This is only one service with one additional functionality. We might come up with additional services in the future which face similar problems. In order to solve this it would be nice to define the API in a descriptive way (maybe through Vorto Models / Generators, Operations and Events come to mind) and provide this to ditto so it may update it's available REST API for twins and features dynamically according to the new services API spec.

EDIT on 2021.08.12:

The API facade needs to allow all kinds of REST API methods. Currently with ditto messages API every request is a POST. One problem with this are semantics of the resulting API a thing (or a delegate service) exposes. E.g. if I just want to GET data, I don't want to send a POST. The other problem is actually a technical one: in our tests we discovered a bug in Firefox that would prevent using a POST that is answered with a `303 See Other`. While this use-case is covered in RFC 2616 it seems to be so uncommon that even well-known browsers don't implement that right.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTI2MjQyNQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

A feature which was long on the roadmap of Eclipse Ditto (see also former GH issue #125 where previous discussions were done) is the ability to distinguish between reported and desired twin state.
`reported` twin state can be seen as data/state coming from the actual device (the current ""truth"") whereas the `desiredProperties` state is something an application in the backend or a mobile app would set as the new requested target state for a property.

## Example

For example, take a room thermostat:
* the actual device reports that the measured-temperature (reported) is 20°
* the currently configured target-temperature (reported) is also 20°
* the user feels chilly, so via a mobile app the (desired) target-temperature is set to 22°
* the actual device receives this desired target-temperature as change notification and sets its `reported` target-temperature also to 22
* when this change was done and `reported = desired` for the target-temperature, the desired target-temperature is removed from the twin
* the measured-temperature in this moment is still 20, and the device will now start heating up the room until the measured-temperature reaches the (reported) target-temperature
* now if the device was offline during the desired target-temperature was configured, upon reconnection it can ask its twin ""give me a delta for the desired state to apply"" and can apply those missed changes

## Benefits

Currently, Eclipse Ditto foresees `features` of a `thing` (aka the digital twin) to contain data/state from real devices in the `properties` of the features.
It is however not defined if those properties are reported or desired state. Up to now this had to be defined by the application developer modeling the data 
to store in Ditto.

By defining in Ditto what is `reported` and what `desired` property state, Ditto can provide several benefits for application developers:
* at any time (e.g. when a device is not connected) the reported and desired properties are clearly distinguishable in the twin
* devices which are offline during changing `desiredProperties` can retrieve all desired state of a digital twin, e.g. on (re-)connection of the device
* delta changes can be calculated by Ditto in order to get a list of changes to be done for an out-of-sync-device to reach its configured desired state
* the `definition` (the information about the contained properties and their types) of a feature applies for both, reported and desired state
* automatic cleanup/deletion of desiredProperties state by Ditto when reported state eventually reaches the desired state
* policies may be applied based on reported/desired, so e.g. a device may be prohibited to change the `desiredProperties` state whereas an end user may be prohibited from changing the `reported` state
* search capabilities based on the desired state, e.g. finding all twins where the desired state is not yet met
* automatic delta calculation and publishing to the device upon device connection
* maintaining order (modification timestamp) of desired/reported changes in order to not apply a desired change when a change done to the actual device was done at a later point in time

This GitHub issue shall act as the overall ""epic"" for all issues regarding the ""desiredProperties"" feature addition.


## EPIC issues 

### Phase 1
* #697: Enhance model and APIs with ""desiredProperties"" for Features
* #700: Support wildcard in ""fields"" selectors in order to receive all ""desired"" properties of all features of a thing
* #698: Delete value of a ""desiredProperties"" feature property once the actual ""property"" was set to the same value
* #701: Convenient creation of parent objects for modify commands with nested JSON paths

### Phase 1+x
* #708: Support for using wildcard in place of feature name in policies
* #702: Search for things/features with pending ""desiredProperties""
* #704: Provide information about desired property changes which could not be applied
* #706: Don't apply desired property if ""applied"" property was changed by device more recently
* #703: Automatically publish remaining desired state upon device connection
* #705: Emit a special event once a single and/or all ""desiredProperties"" were cleared
* #699: Provide a command + APIs in order to calculate+retrieve deltas of desiredProperties vs. properties

I think that this is a cornercase which can only happen during development - once the model/structure of a feature is defined by a fixed ""definition"", there is no renaming of properties.

When updating the major version of a definition (according to semantic versioning this would be the only way to rename a field), there would have to be a migration done anyways, so that migration must migrate properties as well as desired fields the same way.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjUxNjkwMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The latest proposal is the following JSON structure containing the ""desiredProperties"" needed for #696:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""features"": {
    ""Thermostat"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Thermostat:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""status"": {
          ""measured-temperature"": 20
        },
        ""configuration"": {
          ""target-temperature"": 20.0
        }
      },
      ""desiredProperties"": {
        ""configuration"": {
          ""target-temperature"": 22.0
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation:
* aside to `properties` the new Ditto managed field `desiredProperties` is added
* the same `definition` applies for both `properties` and `desiredProperties`
   * however, inside `desiredProperties` all mandatory properties defined by the definition are optional
* once a `desiredProperties` property is set (e.g. by a backend application or mobile app), the actual device has the task to apply that and reflect the applied `desiredProperties` property in the same one below the `properties` object
* when `desiredProperties` is not existing or is empty, all desired property changes were applied, none are pending

The pros/cons of this approach (other formats were already discussed in #125) are:

`+`:
* same definition is shared for properties and desired
   * (future topic relevant for schema validation): however, for desired the ""required"" properties defined in the Vorto model probably have all to be optional
* defines fine grained which deltas should be sent downlink
* policy may be written in a way which defines different access rights for properties/desiredProperties
* search can use desiredProperties and/or reported properties (even in combination)
* reduced unneeded payload duplication (besides properties hierarchy structure in JSON)
* no need for a `desired` channel in addition to `twin/live` - that would be ""just"" another JsonPointer path in the twin

`-`:
* is currently NOT possible by convention before implementing the model enhancement

## Interim format until model is implemented

In order to mitigate the negative point, that this format is not usable in the meantime until the Ditto model was enhanced, the following interim format is suggested:

<details>
  <summary>Click to see the interim format</summary>
  
  ```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""features"": {
    ""Thermostat"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Thermostat:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""~properties"": {
          ""status"": {
            ""measured-temperature"": 20
          },
          ""configuration"": {
            ""target-temperature"": 20.0
         }
        },
        ""~desiredProperties"": {
          ""configuration"": {
            ""target-temperature"": 22.0
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
  ```
</details>

All API calls would work very similar to the future structure. Partial GET/PUT semantics are similarly supported.

The character prefix `""~""` is used to mark that this is the preliminary convention and this allows a simpler migration towards the target format.

Migration is later possible by:
* rewriting all paths: ""properties/~properties"" → ""properties"" and ""properties/~desiredProperties"" → ""desiredProperties""

A script could optionally migrate existing things/policies from the interim format to the actual one once implemented.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/697/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This can be done automatically by Ditto whenever a feature property is changed to the same value as an existing desired property with the same access path.

Example:
Given we have our simple room thermostat:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""features"": {
    ""Thermostat"": {

        },
        ""configuration"": {
          ""target-temperature"": 20.0
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And now e.g. a mobile app sets that the lamp should not be on by setting `target-temperature` should be adjusted by setting `desiredProperties/configuration/target-temperature` to `22.0`:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""features"": {
    ""Thermostat"": {
      ""definition"": [ ""org.eclipse.ditto:Thermostat:1.0.0"" ],
      ""properties"": {
        ""status"": {
          ""measured-temperature"": 20
        },
        ""configuration"": {
          ""target-temperature"": 20.0
        }
      },
      ""desiredProperties"": {
        ""configuration"": {
          ""target-temperature"": 22.0
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* the device registers this change by a received event
* then, it actually performs the hardware action (changing the target temperature, turning the heating on)
* when that was a success, it sets its `properties/configuration/target-temperature` to the applied state: `22.0`
* Ditto will persist this change and automatically remove the `desiredProperties/configuration/target-temperature` as this has now the same value as the `properties/configuration/target-temperature`
   * JSON numbers are semantically compared, that e.g. means `22.0 == 22`
* Ditto will also delete empty JSON objects ""the way up"", including the `desiredProperties` object if all desired changes were confirmed

Like in the above example the `target-temperature`.

If we aim this feature at configuration values, I don't think that we need a check on ""same value"" at all when deleting the desired value for a property. The user sets a desired configuration value and the device updates the reported configuration value. For me this would mean that the desired value becomes obsolete and can be deleted and thus there's no need to automagically compare the values.

If updates from user and device are expected to cause race conditions for devices, ETags could be used to ensure that the desired/reported state is only updated if the Thing is in the expected state.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDgzNjk3Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Oh, that's not what I meant.
With ""delta"" I meant something like calculating a JSON patch for the ""reported"" `properties` which currently differ from the `desiredProperties` ones, e.g.:

## In scope of the ""desired"" project

Such queries are needed in order to get all the (unapplied) ""desiredProperties"" of a thing, e.g. with such a query:
```
GET /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1?fields=features/_/desiredProperties

That is very useful when feature names of a thing are unknown and special parts of all features shall be retrieved with one command.

        ""on"": false,
        ""color"": ""green""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The goal is to get only the ""on"" properties of all lamps of a traffic light.

This shall be simplified by automatically creating missing JSON objects, which also the `desired` properties API will benefit from.

## Implementation details

As suggested in [#680](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/issues/680#issuecomment-654165747) this sync-state metadata information is ""piggy backed"" as part of a normal command, e.g.:
```json
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/my-thermostat-1/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""headers"": {
    ""put-metadata"": [
      {
        ""key"": ""/desiredSyncRevision"",
        ""value"":  42
      },
      {
        ""key"": ""/desiredSyncState"",
        ""value"":  ""not-applicable""
      },
      {
        ""key"": ""/desiredSyncStateDetails"",
        ""value"":  ""invalid target range""
      },
    ]
  },
  ""path"": ""/features/Thermostat/properties/configuration/target-temperature"",
  ""value"": 20.0
}
```

The `_metadata` structure would look like:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-thermostat-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""..."",
  ""features"": {
    ""Thermostat"": {

## Problem statement

A `desiredProperties` property change could be outdated compared to the `reported` property which was e.g. directly changed at a device.
In such cases it does not make sense to apply the `desiredProperties` property.

### Example 

That is useful in e.g. the following scenario. Take the room thermostat again as an example:
* the property `target-temperature` is at 20
* the room thermostat looses its internet connectivity (e.g. due to an ISP outage)
* user feels chilly, so the `desiredProperties` property `configuration/target-temperature` is set via mobile app to 22
* as the device doesn't get this change right away as it is not online, nothing happens
* after some time the user notices that it's not getting warmer so use stands up and changes the `configuration/target-temperature` manually at the room thermostat device to 23
* room thermostat re-establishes connectivity and starts to apply missed `desiredProperties` state changes
* now, the reported/desired feature implemented in #696 would lead to:
   * desired state (`desiredProperties/configuration/target-temperature=22`) differs from actual/reported state (`properties/configuration/target-temperature=23`)
   * the device would apply the desiredProperties `configuration/target-temperature` of 22 as a result and overwrite the locally set `23`
   * the user wonders why the `configuration/target-temperature` is now at 22

What would have been desirable in this scenario:
* if the actual property `configuration/target-temperature` was modified more recently, the desiredProperties `configuration/target-temperature` is no longer valid and deleted
* this is a configurable behavior

## Improvement

After introducing #680 where `_metadata` is added to each property in a thing, it can be found out which `revision` each property has and e.g. _why_ (e.g. due to `""desired-sync""` or `""manual-overwrite""`) it was changed. 
So both the device but also Ditto itself could find out if the property or the desiredProperties property `target-temperature` was updated more recently.

Example Ditto Protocol command (where one of the 2 `""ditto-metadata:changeReason""` values is chosen):
```json
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/my-thermostat-1/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""headers"": {
    ""ditto-metadata:changeReason"": ""desired-sync"",
    ""ditto-metadata:changeReason"": ""manual-overwrite""
  },
  ""path"": ""/features/Thermostat/properties/configuration/target-temperature"",
  ""value"": 20.0
}
```

Ditto know `""changeReson""` values:
* `desired-sync`
* `manual-overwrite`

A device would have the means to determine by itself whether `desiredProperties` or actual reported `properties` are the more recent configuration state and whether the reported `properties` were e.g. modified based on a manual overwrite.

Ditto could also apply a deletion strategy based on the `_revision` and the `changeReason`:
* `reported-more-recent-manual-overwrite`: would delete the `desiredProperties` property if there is a more recently changed reported `property` with a `manual-overwrite` changeReason.

IMHO, extra fields with wildcards should be evaluated towards signal path or value (in case of several features/properties update).
I could not imagine a case where the user will need the definitions of all features of a thing while a single feature or a subset of features are changed, the definition (or any other feature properties) could be useful in the context of the changed feature, isn't it so?

Hi,
Thanks for your notification.
I checked the log and found there is some delay on the heartbeat, which cause the pods dropped by the ditto cluster from time to time, that's because I set the resource limits for both CPU & Memory in case of the OOM, now I removed the limits and found everything runs well.
Ditto is now able to support HA smoothly.

Yes the situation is I would like to make each user has full access to his own resources, including creating & managing their own connections, without the risk of affecting others' connections(e.g. User a cannot delete connection which is created by user B)
Well it seems not possible right now, unless creating another ditto cluster for dedicated user.

I was hoping to use Ditto for a home automation project and run it on a Raspberry Pi, hoping this would be powerful enough for small environments. While building Ditto I run into an error. It seems like it doesn't build on the ARM environment. Is there something wrong in my environment or is this ""as-designed""?

We never tried before building for ARM, so I guess things will go wrong compiling Ditto.
But I would love to see that working as well.

Which JDK did you use for building Ditto?
You would need the JDK 11 for ARM which is e.g. provided by Adoptopenjdk:
https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.7%2B10/OpenJDK11U-jdk_arm_linux_hotspot_11.0.7_10.tar.gz

The error you highlighted **Possible cause: can't load IA 32-bit .so on a ARM-bit platform** from ""swoval-jni"" (included in swoval file-tree-views) sounds like the ""swoval-jni"" only included shared objects for x64 or x86 architectures.
I would guess that this ""swoval-jni"" is a dependency used in ""SBT"" (the build tool for Scala) which is invoked by the scala-maven-plugin, that's why this also appears in the failure stack.

I think that it should be able to compile Scala code with SBT on ARM architecture (I didn't find anything which states the opposite).

What you could try is using the latest ""scala-maven-plugin"" (4.4.0) which uses a more up-to-date SBT zinc comiler [1.3.5](https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin/blob/master/pom.xml#L208).

Ditto uses [scala-maven-plugin 4.1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/pom.xml#L493).

If this doesn't help maybe asking a question either in https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin or in https://github.com/sbt/sbt could help. Then I'm also out of ideas ;)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTkwNTcwNA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That's a good idea. I've downloaded the jars and got them up and running. However, the configuration is a bit unclear to me. I've looked at: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/architecture-overview.html

> Your suggestion basically means that I need to setup MongoDB and NGINX next to Ditto. Is there any guidance on the configuration of this set-up?

Yes, MongoDB is a hard requirement for Ditto. Nginx acts as an optional reverse proxy in front of Ditto - you need it for example, when you want to authenticate users via Basic auth.
If you don't need user authentication (as you are running it locally on a Raspberry this might not be needed), you can also use the [pre-authentication](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/installation-operating.html#pre-authentication) header `x-ditto-pre-authenticated` and add this to your HTTP requests.

Regards the compiling of Ditto on ARM: This should really not be required.
If you would manage to get the build running, you would create the ""starter"" .jar files which I linked above.
You would still need to run them.

In the [docker-compose](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml) file you can see with which parameters the MongoDB and the Ditto services are started:
* the environment variables also have to be set prior to running each starter .jar
* the `command` for the Ditto services is simply `java -jar starter.jar` (where `starter.jar` has to be replaced with each specific ""*-starter.jar"")

Then, the Ditto services should come up and form a cluster.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzM2ODE1OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Regarding your first question: you can find a docker-compose setup with MongoDB and NGINX in [deployment/docker](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/tree/master/deployment/docker).

Regarding the build process: There should be no need to install MongoDB yourself.  If I remember correctly, we're using [flapdoodle](https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo) for unit testing with MongoDB. It should download a binary of MongoDB itself and run it in the unit tests. There should be some logging output what version it tries to download and start. Can you check if that version would be working on your Raspi?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzM2ODI1OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Just sharing some experience this time.

I've spend the last week or so trying to get Ditto running on CentOS 8. However, Docker does not seem to like the firewalld service that CentOS 8 uses. This causes some conflict as Docker pre-configures iptables. This results in the Ditto ""Bad gateway"" error. 

Summary: Google: ""Centos 8 docker firewalld""
Solution: move the docker0 interface to the public zone of the firewall and apply masquerading:

https://serverfault.com/questions/987686/no-network-connectivity-to-from-docker-ce-container-on-centos-8 

ip link show
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
sudo firewall-cmd --get-zone-of-interface=docker0
sudo nmcli connection modify docker0 connection.zone public
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-masquerade --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo systemctl restart docker

Edit: I struggled getting this to work after my post. It seems there is even an influence in timing. If the docker containers spin up to fast it still doesn't work. At this moment I've figured out that I need to start the containers manually after the machine is fully booted. I need to create a script that delays the startup of the containers.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/742/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, connectivity service stop consuming message from rabbit-ditto-connection-source-3 with this bug.

This metadata can also be queried, but currently only when retrieving the complete thing, e.g.:
```
GET /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:fancy-car?fields=thingId,features,_revision,_metadata

response:
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:fancy-car"",
  ""features"": {
    ""Vehicle"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""speed"": 42

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The same is true for the Ditto Protocol JSON API.

As an enhancement of enabling that basic query we should add the possibility to query for metadata even when doing a ""partial retrieve"", e.g. via HTTP:
```
GET /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:fancy-car/features/Vehicle/properties/speed

response payload:
42
```

Now, the `""fields""` selector is not supported at this level `""/features/Vehicle/properties/speed""` and this would also be strange as strictly speaking at this location in the JSON there is no metadata.

So I suggest to e.g. define a HTTP header (or in addition a HTTP query param) in order to select metadata.
The HTTP response would include the requested metadata (if it was existing) as HTTP response header.

HTTP Example:
```
GET /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:fancy-car/features/Vehicle/properties/speed?get-metadata=issuedAt

response payload:
42

response headers:
  metadata: ""[{""issuedAt"": ""some timestamp ....""}]""
```

The format could be just a comma separated list of metadata to retrieve relatively to the selected path.

As all of Ditto's loggers, this logger is not thread-safe. However, `ThingCommandEnforcement` happens to access the logger in parallel. This leads to a `NullPointerException` where in `DittoDiagnosticLoggingAdapter` the correlation ID is made a String.

A first, defensive, approach to circumvent that NPE is to not call `toString` on the correlation ID but passing it down to LogUtil as CharSequence. Furthermore, `ThingCommandEnforcement` should not use its parent's logger but its own (which should be a `DittoLogger`).
Both measures do not remedy the problem of tangled correlation IDs due to parallel calls to logger.

How about a new type like `ThreadSafeDittoLogger` which differs from the already existing `DittoLogger` in a way that it only provides the `withCorrelationId` methods as well as the `discardCorrelationId` method.

An immutable implementation of that type could return a new logger instance for each of those methods which guarantees thread safety.

The 3 obvious implicit metadata fields coming to my mind:
* `_revision`: the thing `_revision` in which the JSON leaf (e.g. a feature property or an attribute) was modified for the last time
* `_modified`: the modification date at which the JSON leaf (e.g. a feature property or an attribute) was modified for the last time
* `_created`: the creation date at which the JSON leaf (e.g. a feature property or an attribute) was created

I suggest keeping the underscore prefix `_` in order to ""mark"" that those are automatic / Ditto managed metadata fields.

Why would we? Defaults can only be static, can't they?
What would be the benefit to have an implicit Metadata with the same static default value for each Json leaf?

I think static metadata defaults would only make sense if one can also specify for which paths those defaults apply. This would make it possible to load a vorto model as kind-of prototype into the metadata which would then automatically apply metadata to incoming data of this model / the provided auto-metadata definition. However for most parts this could also be written initially on thing creation. Anyways this is how I would image something like this:

```json
  ""_metadata"": {
    ""prototype"": {
      ""features"": {
        ""temperature"": {
          ""properties"": {
            ""value"": {
              ""measurementUnit"": ""°C""
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Which produces this thing:

```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:thing-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""..."",
  ""features"": {
    ""temperature"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""value"": true
      }
    }
  },
  ""_created"": ""2020-06-01T10:00:00Z"",
  ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:30:00Z"",
  ""_revision"": 42,
  ""_metadata"": {
    ""prototype"": {
      ""features"": {
        ""temperature"": {
          ""properties"": {
            ""value"": {
              ""measurementUnit"": ""°C""
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    ""policyId"": {
      ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:00:00Z"",
      ""_revision"": 1
    },
    ""features"": {
      ""temperature"": {
        ""properties"": {
          ""value"": {
            ""_modified"": ""2020-06-09T14:30:00Z"",
            ""_revision"": 42,
            ""measurementUnit"": ""°C""
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If one would change the model / auto-metadata of this kind then new incoming data would automatically cause a change of the attached metadata.

A use-case for this could be a status property which is a map of wireless device in range which is dynamically filled. I know which metadata the objects of this map would have, but they are not present on thing creation.

**One problem I stumbled upon with current metadata in general**: in the above example the color object is not a leaf and hence has no metadata assigned. In terms of `_modified` and `_revision` I can infer the data by going through each leaf and see which one is the ""oldest"". If we think about other metadata e.g. from vorto like the description, measurementUnit or editable flag, those can also be set for the color object hence the requirement for metadata not only for leafs.

**Other interesting built-in**:

* _created - we have a status property containing a map of several wireless nodes which is dynamically filled with wireless nodes in range. It would be useful to see when an entry to this map was first created. In this case: how does metadata cope with arrays?

Sure - simply in order to save on the additional data volume when someone does not need it at all.
Also, Ditto managed things do have a max. size in bytes (by default 100kB). The implicit metadata could probably half this max. reachable size.

I could not follow your thoughts here and don't see why this is an added value comparing to setting the metadata when e.g. creating the thing JSON based on a Vorto model.

> [...] those can also be set for the color object hence the requirement for metadata not only for leafs.

Yes, that's why the current `_metadata` implementation allows setting metadata also on objects.
I do not yet see that as requirement for implicitly created metadata (like the mentioned ones _modified and _revision or even _created) as those can be determined by their ""children"" as you mentioned.

> If we think about other metadata e.g. from vorto like the description, measurementUnit or editable flag, those can also be set for the color object hence the requirement for metadata not only for leafs.

Yes, that's possible right now - should have nothing to do with implicitly added metadata.

> _created [...]

Agreed, that could be useful as well. We also added `_created` on thing level in Ditto 1.2.0

> [...] how does metadata cope with arrays?

What do you mean with that?
A metadata's value should be able to be an array.
Setting the metadata on an array value should be possible as well.
Setting the metadata to a JsonObject inside an array is most probably not possible as Ditto (ditto-json and the JsonPointer implementation we have in place) does not handle Json arrays very well.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MzI5MTU2Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Fair enough! In that case: should built-in metadata be enabled or disabled by default? Is `auto-metadata` opt-in or opt-out? This behavior could be controlled on a global level or even per namespace.

Furthermore an alternative approach could be to set it this way:

```json
""_metadata"": {
  ""settings"": {
    ""auto-metadata"": {
      ""_revision"": true,
      ""_modified"": true
    }
  }
}
```

Imagine a feature with a property tracking wireless devices in range (e.g. LoRa Gateways or Devices):

```json
""LoRaGateways"": {
  ""properties"": {
    ""status"": {
      ""gatewaysInRange"": {
        ""some-id-ab79dc8d8f0f"": {
          ""signalStrength"": -7,
          ""noise"": 100
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and metadata:

```json
""_metadata"": {
  ""features"": {
    ""LoRaGateways"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""status"": {
          ""gatewaysInRange"": {
            ""some-id-ab79dc8d8f0f"": {
              ""noise"": {
                ""measurementUnit"": ""dB""
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this case I know the metadata from the model in advance, but I don't know / have the actual objects in the `gatewaysInRange` map. I'd have to get the vorto model to be able to write the metadata for each new object in the map. I'd rather like to have this set once and ditto filling it in automatically.

To be able to do this I'd need the ability to set this metadata with the correct path from the vorto model at thing creation (or update it later of course) and ditto needs to apply this everytime I put a new object into such a map. This is a problem of complex data types and it may be argued if it's in dittos responsibility to manage this.

> > [...] how does metadata cope with arrays?
>
> What do you mean with that?

Jackson should not be a required dependency for Ditto-json. It's only used in Ditto's backend for doing CBOR serialization.

ditto-json in fact has imports to `com.fasterxml.jackson.core` and `com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.cbor` - however catches a `NoClassDefFoundError` when they can't be loaded during runtime.

This `CborAvailabilityChecker` is used in both JsonObject and JsonArray implementations.

Body:

{
    ""my response"": ""is this""

## Unhappy path

The only way I can reproduce is by sending an escaped JSON as ""value"":

```json
{
	""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/test-message-response/things/live/messages/hello"",
	""headers"": {
		""correlation-id"": ""239b383f-fc09-48e1-86e2-70477fc71e88"",
		""version"": 2,

	},
	""path"": ""/inbox/messages/hello"",
	""value"": ""\""my response\"": \""is this\"""",
	""status"": 200
}
```

This leads - as expected - to the HTTP response:
```json
""\""my response\"": \""is this\""""
```

It seems that it is not allowed to return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in combination with using an `EventSource` containing `withCredentials: true`.

Ditto's `CorsEnablingDirective` sets this wildcard cross-origin-header.
I suggest that you disable the Ditto-built-in CORS header addition by configuring the gateway's env var `ENABLE_CORS` (see https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/gateway/starter/src/main/resources/gateway.conf#L30 ) to false and to add the CORS headers e.g. in an nginx in front of Ditto where you don't set the wildcard `*` but use the requests.

In nginx you can do it like in this example: https://gist.github.com/alexjs/4165271

That uses the `$http_origin` to put into the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` instead of the wildcard:
```
...
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' ""$http_origin"";
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true';
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';

Yes, it is .. it seems not to be documented very well however :(

Just use the username and password as part of the connection URI, e.g.:
```
tpc://user:password@localhost:1883

The response receives a status of 303 and a location header. If the location header is all-lower-case `location` it is not returned to the client of the original ditto message. Only if the header is `Location` it is returned (and all-lowercase again at the client, at least with curl).

I've verified (via log) that the location header is present until the point right before it's returned via the websocket send operation. I've also verified that this happens from ditto v1.1 to 1.3. For < 1.1 I don't know.

According to the HTTP RFCs 2616 and 7230 HTTP headers should be case-**in**sensitive.

How to reproduce

1. Connect via websocket to ditto's live channel
2. Send an arbitrary live message to the websocket listener
3. Send a `location` or `Location` header with the response

Accompanied by warnings in the logs only 10-20% of mqtt packages now make it through to ditto and get persistet. From the logs I suppose that the packages arrive at the connectivity stack but do not get persisted.

This problem first occurred in ditto 1.2. I'm currently operating ditto 1.3.x.

From the connectivity service logs I observe a lot of HiveMQTT client warnings and I'm pretty sure that those did not appear before 1.2:

```

```

I've an extensive array of stored history of metrics from past months and can confirm via deployment and rollback times of ditto 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 that this issue was introduced somewhere between 1.1 and 1.2. 

One more side-note: the metrics from the devops endpoint seem not to include those failed attempts as failures in a connection sense

I found those additional log entries but I don't know if they are related:

One of both clients is either dropped when the other connects or connection is denied for one of them, don't know for sure.

There were multiple connections trying to access the broker with the same credentials which lead to constant reconnects and thus package drops. 

Restarting the connectivity service solved the issue. I thought I had already tried that, but I suppose I did when those multiple connections were still present and didn't thought about it after actually removing all other connections.

In return that means somehow older connections survived the piggyback removal and stayed open / active until I restarted the service (I did not recreate the container).

Hi @w4tsn 
That's both good to hear and bad to hear :-D
Good that you fixed it and that is not a fundamental problem in Ditto's MQTT connectivity.
Not easy to reproduce this however as this is probably an update issue of an older Ditto version to a newer one.

If you find out how to reproduce we would be happy to look into this - that's the first time we saw an issue like that.

Regarding the warning and settings of `reconnectForRedelivery` and `separatePublisherClient` we will look into it.
Maybe the default should be not `true` for the both settings, but only when configured specifically.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODcyMDcxMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We also encountered this issue (the connection being kept alive multiple times). I don't have any way to reproduce this easily but I think the chances of encountering this issue is higher when you are creating faulty connections. I usually need a few iterations when creating a new connection to configure it correctly. During these re-configurations a connection might get ""lost"" in the sense that this connection will live on its own.
This results in multiple connections targeting the same (external) host. This host does not allow multiple connections with the same credentials resulting in disconnections all the time. Restarting the ditto-connectivity service ensures only 1 connection is created again which solves the problem.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODczOTEwNA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It therefore does not make sense to adopt one (or several) of the domain specific models you mentioned.

What will not happen is replacing the well established and stable APIs of Ditto with WoT APIs, just because.
What could however make sense is to additionally adopt W3C WoT (e.g. via an additional WoT compatibility layer) which is also domain agnostic.
Eclipse Vorto is currently investigating how to generate WoT models based on Vorto models, see: https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/issues/2344
That way WoT could also map easier to Ditto as well.

If you have a more concrete idea how Web of Things could be applied on top of Ditto, please share your thoughts on that.
As I see it, WoT can't replace Ditto's APIs as Ditto provides at some parts more functionality and flexibility than WoT (e.g. when it comes to [authorization based on Ditto policies](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-policy.html)).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDU2NDUzNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

What I did
---

I retrieved the whole thing first via GET, then added based on it's contents and a model a series of put-metadata header entries and finally pushed the whole thing back to ditto. The metadata entries had keys beginning at the things root like this `/features/lamp/properties/status/active` and values of arbitrary json. 

What happened
---

The metadata was not written. An empty `_metadata` object appeared in the thing. After this I tried to do this on the properties and properties/<specific-property> level which resulted in a deeper `_metadata` object but with empty leafs. Turned out I still used the full paths in the keys where I should have used relative ones. Didn't tried to update the keys because I already decomposed everything into single requests for all properties with metadata keys now being just one level and values being primitive.

Expectation
---

The metadata should have been written. I expect if I PUT a whole thing and provide a put-metadata header with like 20 different entries, everyone with a property path from the root to the property as the key that the value, either primitive or arbitrary json, is written.

I tried this on my current Ditto 1.5.x Stack (wasn't able to upgrade yet) and it seems to be broken there. No metadata created if using a complex json object as value and a simple key. I'm working around this by splitting up the bigger json object value and flattening it so I get an array with key/value pairs for every leaf.

I guess this is fixed in recent ditto so I'll close this with the knowledge that this problem goes away once I manage to upgrade the cluster.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C842uXK-/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

With support for a per-feature _revision field being in the loop (#778) it would be possible to detect concurrent modifications.

1. a twin exists in Ditto having feature XYZ set to 1 (revision 0)
1. client A sends feature update (XYZ=2, rev. 0)
1. Ditto processes client As request 
1. client B sends feature update (XYZ=3, rev. 0)
1. Ditto updates the twins feature to XYZ=2, rev. 1 and sends an event to client B (client A doesn't receive one since it initiated the update)
1. client B receives the event and updates its internal state to XYZ=2, rev. 1
1. Ditto processes client Bs request

In this last step with the current implementation Ditto would just update the twins feature to XYZ=3, rev. 2 and send the update event to client A (but not B), leaving client B with a wrong state (its update is lost).

In a future implementation Ditto should compare the revision sent along with the request of client B (rev. 0) with the twins feature revision at that time (rev. 1 after As update) and raise an error that the feature has been modified in the meanwhile. 

Probably its reasonable to make this behavior configurable (system wide or per client / request)

As discussed in Gitter.IM we would appreciate such a contribution.
Implementation hints:
* HTTP handling in Ditto is done with [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html)
* the Ditto service responsible for terminating HTTP requests is the [gateway service](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/architecture-services-gateway.html), see also the [architecture](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/architecture-overview.html)
* [`RootRoute.buildApiSubRoutes(RequestContext, DittoHeaders)`](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/services/gateway/endpoints/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/services/gateway/endpoints/routes/RootRoute.java#L264) would be the place to add a new top-level route below `/api/2/`
* the ""ditto-protocol-adapter"" module must be used in order to parse Ditto Protocol JSON messages to `Signals` which have to be forwarded in the cluster
   * https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.eclipse.ditto/ditto-protocol-adapter/1.4.0/bundle
   * Example use:
```java
private Signal<?> jsonToDittoSignal(final String jsonString) {
   final JsonObject jsonObject = JsonObject.of(jsonString);
   final JsonifiableAdaptable jsonifiableAdaptable = ProtocolFactory.jsonifiableAdaptableFromJson(jsonObject);
   final DittoProtocolAdapter dittoProtocolAdapter = DittoProtocolAdapter.newInstance();
   return dittoProtocolAdapter.fromAdaptable(jsonifiableAdaptable);
}
```
* The created `Signal` has to be passed into a `handlePerRequest` variant of `org.eclipse.ditto.services.gateway.endpoints.routes.AbstractRoute`

Regarding naming and verb of the new endpoint I would suggest:
* using `POST` as verb
* regarding the ""noun"" I am not yet sure ..
   *  `/events` for example would not fit IMO as Ditto Protocol JSON messages are not always events, but also commands
   * `/protocolMessages` could be an option, however I would like to prevent using camel case or a dash in the endpoint
   * maybe `/signals` as all Ditto Protocol JSON messages represent Signals: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-signals.html","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTA4ODY0Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Some initial thoughts on this:

- if a command is not yet implemented for a feature on the live channel a 400 with an ""unimplemented"" notice should be returned. 400, because I don't know if there's any better suited status. 406 sound similar, but is semantically different.
- implementing the commands needs an API to 'plug-in' implementations
- for AMQP and MQTT connected clients I suppose (at least for mqtt) that the client will need an implementation to interact with an mqtt / amqp client ? As additional data channel to websocket and REST

My basic idea here is to have as much of the API as possible defined as ditto protocol for commands, such that I don't need to worry much about status codes and such. Opposed to the messages API where implementation is highly use-case and device specific, which is good since e.g. (vorto) operations implemented as messages follow a custom API.

A bit of background where I'm coming from with this: I'm implementing python and js agents for IoT devices. There is also a node-red project, where the js client will receive a node-red contrib wrapper node to allow graphical interaction with ditto in node-red.

I'll additionally require a python SDK for some devices which I plan to open-source / contribute.

I could think of RQL queries for those like this `eq(__lifecycle/features/lamp,""CREATED"")`.

So I'm currently further tracking life cycle states which might be really use-case dependent and not that helpful for a general implementation. Would have to think about that a bit more first, but here you go:

* `ACTIVE` as in ""put into duty"" to mark that the device history is written to prod systems and those kind of things so we keep the initialization stuff separated from production
* `INACTIVE` if the device is relocated, receives off the grid maintenance / upgrades or other things which are not considered ""production updates""
* `RETIRED` to mark that this device is now put out of service and maybe deleted or archived for later reference (our devices have unique IDs that also tie together history, alerting etc.)

```

The main issue was that the reply topic is ` 'control///res/{}/200'.format(req_id)` and not command.

Simply states that the cloud event binding for HTTP **can** be used the same way for request and response. However there is no requirement that the endpoint must response with a cloud event.

Taking a look at the example code from cloudevents seems to confirm this:

https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-rust/blob/6f5a767f196cea6bf732cde9680c1c233fbddf80/example-projects/actix-web-example/src/main.rs#L6-L11

However, I think it may make sense for Ditto to respond with something other than ""ok, I processed the event"". If Ditto can provide additional information, as the outcome of the operation, then it could provide this.

I am not sure how the `Accept` header fits into the picture. I don't think the header is used by the cloud events spec. And so I don't think Ditto should introduce a new concept, which is not covered by the HTTP cloud events mapping.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODY0MjA4NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

`JmsMessage` is the correct datatype used by the AMQP client Ditto uses (qpid).

The signature of the mapper method is:

Is `bytePayload` also `null` in your case?

Still confused about the message format and why headers and contentType was null.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NzY2NDA3NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Indeed - however, this is the concept of the used [Qpid AMQP 1.0 client](https://qpid.apache.org/components/jms/index.html) which is unfortunately the only usable AMQP 1.0 client for Java.
This client ""wraps"" the AMQP 1.0 interaction via JMS API, so the Ditto codebase has no other option than using JMS API which could lead to confusion in e.g. logs.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NzY5OTUyOQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have a question about using the ""extraFields"" parameter together with server sent events.

Let's say I want to retrieve all attributes and all features together with the changed data. I specified the event source and the extraFields like this:
```
let eventSourceInitDict = { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${tokenResponse.access_token}` }, withCredentials: true };
let es = new EventSource(environment.dittoUrl + '/things?extraFields=features,attributes', eventSourceInitDict);
```

For testing I used the example thing from the documentation which looks like this at the beginning:
```json
{
    ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-coffeebrewer"",
    ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-coffeebrewer"",
    ""definition"": ""com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"",
    ""attributes"": {
        ""manufacturer"": ""ACME demo corp."",
        ""location"": ""Berlin, main floor"",
        ""serialno"": ""42"",
        ""model"": ""Speaking coffee machine""
    },
    ""features"": {
        ""coffee-brewer"": {
            ""properties"": {
                ""brewed-coffees"": 0
            }
        },
        ""water-tank"": {
            ""properties"": {
                ""configuration"": {
                    ""smartMode"": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the next step I updated the attribute ""manufacturer"" to the value ""ACME demo corp. test test test"". I received all features from the server sent event like expected. However, there's only the updated attribute included and not the other ones:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-coffeebrewer"",
  ""attributes"": {
    ""manufacturer"": ""ACME demo corp. test test test""
  },
  ""features"": {
    ""coffee-brewer"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""brewed-coffees"": 0
      }
    },
    ""water-tank"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""configuration"": {
          ""smartMode"": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The same thing happens if I try to update a feature instead. If I try to update the feature ""coffee-brewer"" to 
```json
{
  ""properties"": {
    ""brewed-coffees"": 100
  }
}
```
then all attributes are included but the other features are missing, I receive the following from the sse:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-coffeebrewer"",
  ""attributes"": {
    ""manufacturer"": ""ACME demo corp. test test test"",
    ""location"": ""Berlin, main floor"",
    ""serialno"": ""42"",
    ""model"": ""Speaking coffee machine""
  },
  ""features"": {
    ""coffee-brewer"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""brewed-coffees"": 100
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I'm aware that it might not be the best idea to return all features and attributes on every change of the thing, but my question is, is this the expected behaviour when all features and attributes are included in the extraFields like this: `/things?extraFields=features,attributes` or did I miss something here to retrieve the missing attributes and features in this case?

I don't know if I've missed something crucial here and any clarification is very appreciated. Thank you very much!

Final thing looks like this:

```json
{
    ""thingId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-coffeebrewer"",
    ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:my-coffeebrewer"",
    ""definition"": ""com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"",

        ""location"": ""Berlin, main floor"",
        ""serialno"": ""42"",
        ""model"": ""Speaking coffee machine""
    },

We mainly focus on binary incompatible changes to Ditto's model classes - the HTTP APIs (in API version `2`) are not affected and are still compatible. API version `1` will be dropped as we already deprecated API version `1` some time ago.

---

## 1. remove `setDittoHeaders(DittoHeaders)` from `WithDittoHeaders`
Not every class implementing `WithDittoHeaders` should also be capable of setting `DittoHeaders`. Extract a new interface for setting `DittoHeaders`.

## 2. Rework default connection behavior of Ditto Java client
By default a newly created Ditto client shall not connect itself automatically, but only when a `connect()` method is explicitly invoked. As this requires a breaking API change, this is listed here.

## 3. Make `AbstractDittoHeaders` implement `Map<String,String>`
The functionality from AbstractMap is currently overwritten in AbstractDittoHeader's implementation, so there is no added value in extending from AbstractMap.

## 4. Java Client API handlers should return `CompletionStage` instead of `CompletableFuture`
In Ditto Java Client 1.x all APIs return a `CompletableFuture`. That is bad as the Ditto client user may complete this `CompletableFuture` by himself which could break things in the client.  
Therefore all APIs formerly returned `CompletableFuture` will return a `CompletionStage` instead - on this the Ditto client user may still call `.toCompletableFuture()` in order to get a ""new"" CompletableFuture.

## 5. Make `DittoRuntimeException` abstract
We don't want to instantiate `DittoRuntimeException` itself, but only concrete implementation with a better context about the exception.

## 6. Remove dependency of placeholders model on all signals
In order to get some dependency 

## 7. Move live signals to Ditto Java client
The `ditto-signals-*-live` modules are only used in the Java client, so move it there.

## 8. Remove API 1 from models, signals, routes
API 1 (with the ""ACL"" based authorization) will be completely removed, both from the codebase as well as from the HTTP endpoints.

## 9. Fix `EntityId`+`WithId` and remove from `Signal` interface
Not every signal actually has a `EntityId`, but `Signal` extends `WithId` -> fix that.

## 10. Enforce Non-nullable in `PolicyResponse`s
A really small one ..

## 11. Remove all APIs marked with `@Deprecated`
Most of API 1 APIs are already marked as `@Deprecated` in the Ditto codebased, but also other methods/classes for which we already have an alternative which should be used.
Delete all of them.

## 12. Remove all remaining raw types where generics should be used
Pull through generics magic.

## 13. Re-structure Ditto's maven modules + packages
The Maven modules of Ditto are often defined technically and not feature wise. In order to fix that a lot of moving/consolidation of modules and packages is required.

---

We'll add more text to the headings if you need more input on a topic, just wanted to lay out a first (rough) direction of the work on our plate for Ditto 2.0.

What is important to note:  
We do aim to provide minimal impact on updating a Ditto 1.5.x installation to a Ditto 2.0.0 installation - there should be minimal migration effort (e.g. only affecting very few configuration settings of Ditto).

Where do I check this?

With that I mean whether the SSE channel has the proper [authorization](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-auth.html#authorization), so the authenticated user/client is allowed to `READ` the things in order to get notfications.

Given you log in `concierge`:
```
2021-03-01 13:13:28,303 INFO  [d5d3b0eb-9113-4780-93f4-cb05e724f70b] o.e.d.s.c.e.EnforcerActor akka://ditto-cluster/user/conciergeRoot/enforcer - before building JsonView - ThingPreconditionNotModifiedException: The comparison of precondition header 'if-none-match' for the requested Thing resource evaluated to false. Expected: '""hash:c72ec265""' not to match actual: '""hash:c72ec265""'.
```

Do you intentionally set the `If-None-Match` header when modifying the Thing?
If not I assume your browser automatically sets that which prevents that the Thing is updated at all as long as the value you want to update does not change.

That would also explain that you don't get events via SSE - because there are not modifications to the thing at all because of that `If-None-Match` optimization.

It seems to me now that the concierge module does not even get the message? Am I wrong?

It is worth mentioning that with the prev. version of cloud2edge (0.1.2) sending commands worked!

That would make granular permission control a lot easier to implement.

Below a simple demonstration of what we'd like to achieve:
![multiple-policies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1424486/109845953-f59d8800-7c4d-11eb-9ee1-c632de1f3c83.png)
Take for example a situation where Things are installed at 2 physical locations. Operators on site would have permission to view properties of the Thing, but not modify (Teams A and B). Overseeing all operations is Team X, which has permission to modify/delete every Thing. Additionally, there's a maintenance team (Team C) that can travel to both physical locations, but only has permission to change specific features of Things (not necessarily restricted that much), for a specific subset of Things.

To achieve something like that, it would be (for a ditto developer) a lot easier if things could be assigned multiple policies.

Compare that to what we currently would have to configure:
![single-policy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1424486/109845958-f6361e80-7c4d-11eb-9778-ccded1331ced.png)

We understood that this may have a negative performance impact on the thingssearch index, as it would have to be rebuilt if a policy is modified. However, whether using multiple policies or not, that bottleneck is always going to be there.

What we're proposing here would mean breaking the current API: a Thing would really just take an array of `PolicyId`s, rather than a single one. This would keep the possibility to filter things based on policyId. With the 'import' proposal made in #298, that would require an indirection: You'd first have to find all policies that import the one you're querying, and then match those with the actual devices.

With Ditto 2.0 we remove ""API schema version 1"" (ACL based) and maintaining several schema versions at the same time is a huge amount of additional maintenance work.

Additionally, as policies may also be used by other entities than things (e.g. also policies itself), all those other entities would also need to support containing a list of policyIds. Better in terms of re-use from my point of view is to make the policy more mighty (e.g. by the imports mentioned in #298).

Filtering things based on policyId is for me another use case which should be tracked separately.
Technically this would probably be another search index.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDQxODA0Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The `gateway` logs a `INFO` message: `Creating WebSocket for connection authContext: <....>` when opening a new websocket.
Please check the content of this log message.

The second thing to check would be the `things` service - there you have to increase the log level to `DEBUG` as described before.
For each persisted and published event the `things` service logs a `DEBUG` message: `Persisting Event<...>`.
Please check the content of this log message - this includes a Ditto event containing DittoHeaders.
The `DittoHeaders` contain a `ditto-read-subjects` entry. This entry must contain one of the subjects ( ""authSubjects""/""authContext"") with which your WebSocket session was created.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5OTI0MTU2NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

the log says ""autocreation"" mapper worked successfully and message was consummed.
But the creation didn't happen. And I got an error response:

~~~ json
{
  ""status"": 404,
  ""error"": ""things:thing.notfound"",
  ""message"": ""The Thing with ID 'keti:Xavier-1' could not be found or requester had insufficient permissions to access it."",
  ""description"": ""Check if the ID of your requested Thing was correct and you have sufficient permissions.""
}
~~~




Did I miss anything?
Thanks for the help.

The packages chart version `0.1.3` contains Hono chart version `1.4.21` which contains Eclipse Hono `1.5.1`.
As far as I know, `auto-provisioning` came to Eclipse Hono in version `1.6.0`, so the packages you are running does not support that yet, see also the release notes of Hono for ""1.6.0"": https://www.eclipse.org/hono/release-notes/:

> Hono now supports `auto-provisioning` of devices that connect via gateway.

I did not look at your logs yet because I think the versions just mismatch.

you can use the `ImplicitThingCreationMapper` independent of Eclipse Hono `auto-provisioning`.

The `auto-provisioning` feature can be used for filtering when to invoke the `ImplicitThingCreationMapper`.
i.e. setting the mappingDefinition:
```
""mappingDefinitions"": {
	""autoCreation"": {
		""mappingEngine"": ""ImplicitThingCreation"",
		""incomingConditions"": {
			""hono-registration"": ""fn:filter(header:hono_registration_status, 'eq', 'NEW')""
		},
		""options"": {
			""thing"": {
				""thingId"": ""{{ header:device_id }}"",
				""policyId"": ""'""${MY_POLICY}""'"",
				""attributes"": {
					""CreatedBy"": ""ImplicitThingCreation""
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
would invoke the `ImplicitThingCreationMapper` only when a new device is registered in Eclispe Hono, thus not causing the log errors: `""Ran into a failure when mapping outgoing signal: The Thing with ID 'keti:Xavier-1' already exists Choose another Thing ID""`

Since the logs state that the `ImplicitThingCreationMapper` was applied correctly for that device, I would think the problem is the used authorization-subject. Can you check whether the authorization-subject granted permissions in `""${MY_POLICY}""` matches the authorization-subject via which you're authenticating the thing-retrieval? You can use the [whoami endpoint](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Policies/get_whoami) for that.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDAwMTc0OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Well, yes and no - it can be used independently from Hono as @DerSchwilk already explained - but you need to be able to define a ""condition"" which evaluates to `true` only for incoming messages indicating that a new device was created. And this is for example the case for Hono's [Automatic provisioning](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/concepts/device-provisioning/#automatic-device-provisioning) via the sent [device provisioning notification](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/api/event/#device-provisioning-notification).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDAxNDkxOQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As a workaround you can set the environment variable `DITTO_PUBSUB_RESTART_DELAY` to `0s` (defaults to `10s`), this should cause that after such an error, the `Publisher` gets immediately restarted.
However, events might still be ""lost"".

The only explanation I have is that some local directory to the container is still present which contains an old format of the events in Akka's ""ddata"". Probably the format changed between releases and we didn't notice ourself as we always create new containers instead of re-using old ones.
Do you have a persistent mount or something which would cause that some old data written to the filesystem with an older Ditto version might after the update still be available?

I would like to open up the discussion of using WoT to describe a feature/thing.
Vorto was the go-to solution to describe a thing but it looks like this will be discontinued. Therefore, we are looking for another solution to describe our models. WoT, more specifically the ""Thing Model"", has been mentioned several times in the gitter chat and looks like a good fit.
We would like to get everyone on the same page concerning this so we can easily use a possible future integration between Ditto and WoT. 
The ultimate result of this issue/discussion IMO would be a best practice article in Ditto documentation which will be a guideline for a future integration. In order to have that, we should agree upon this best practice.

https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#thing-model

WoT quote:
> ""This paradigm can be compared with abstract class or interface definition (~Thing Model) in object-oriented programming to create objects (~Thing Descriptions).""

A WoT ""Thing Model"":
> [...] mainly describes interaction affordances such as the [Properties](https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#dfn-property), [Actions](https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#dfn-action), and [Events](https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#dfn-event) and common metadata.

A Ditto Thing is unfortunately not a good fit for the WoT ""Thing Model"" - because a Thing in Ditto may consist of several features, all of which can follow ""interface definitions"".
However I think that a Ditto ""Feature"" (part of a Thing) is the perfect match for being backed by a WoT ""Thing Model"".

| WoT Thing Model concept | Ditto concept |
| ---                                       | ---                   |
| [Properties](https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#dfn-property) | [Feature properties](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-feature.html#feature-properties) + Feature desired properties |
| [Actions](https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#dfn-action) | Feature ""inbox"" (TO the thing) [messages](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-messages.html#elements) |
| [Events](https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#dfn-event) | Feature ""outbox"" (FROM the thing) [messages](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-messages.html#elements) |

The [Feature definition](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-feature.html#feature-definition) is a Json Array of String, currently limited to the form:
* `<namespace>:<name>:<version>`

Which is obviously targeted to Vorto models.
I think we could relax this restriction and also accept URIs ... that way you could define URIs to WoT ""Thing Models"" (JSON-LD files available via HTTP, e.g. hosted by a GitHub repo).

The [Thing level definition](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-thing.html#definition) currently does not have a match to a WoT concept.
It could (to think about!) make sense to apply the thing level definition, also accepting a WoT ""Thing Model"" to the Thing attributes + to the messages (actions/events in WoT speak) you can directly send/receive from a Thing.

What I really like about the WoT ""Thing Model"" is the closeness to ""JSON Schema"" - IMO that would be the best way to do a validation of JSON data, e.g. for feature properties or messages.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDc2NDA3Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

However, I need to run this on a cluster with a custom internal domain name, not being `cluster.local`.

As far as I can see, this probably has to do with how Akka determines the domain names of the other hosts. It looks like Akka is using the IP, with dots substituted for underscores. Like `1_2_3_4.<namespace>.pod` and then appends `cluster.local`.

From what I can see, [Akka has a setting in its `reference.conf` called pod-domain](https://github.com/akka/akka-management/blob/master/discovery-kubernetes-api/src/main/resources/reference.conf), which defaults to `cluster.local`.

The load increased by around 300%, after 5 minutes of runtime all requests are answered with a 503, the logs are full of timeout errors, JWT errors and warnings about increasingly slow HTTP connections. Let's go into the details what is happening:

First the cluster starts and reports an overall OK status. New log entries appear of INFO level stating that JWTs are successfully validated (this is already somewhat ""slow"" compared to the amount of JWT-based requests that should go through). No warnings or errors yet. The business applications already show that requests are really slow, although most still succeed. After around 3 minutes of runtime the problems begin to pile up. In the log of the gateway service the first warnings about 60s timeouts and slow HTTP connections show up. The timeouts as well as the HTTP warnings grow larger and larger in both their ""overdue"" time and quantity in the log. Then the successful JWT INFO messages disappear and are replaced by more and more JWT invalidation errors, because the JWTs provided are expired. The duration since expiration increases over time as if either the provided JWTs don't get refreshed (this I doubt) or messages get validated increasingly late.

Details about my setup
---

The special case of my setup is that I'm using a lot of issuers. 20 by the time of this writing. This is because every auth realm has it's own distinct issuer endpoint. Maybe that is a problem or at least something not accounted for in the tests?

How I upgraded
---

I changed the container image version numbers and updated the JWT issuer configuration, such that the newly introduced object level with the `issuer` key is accounted for. 

I've yet to monitor the whole log of the cluster. Maybe there are other issues in other services as well. I only took a brief look into the cluster log, because that one is massive. The gateway log stood out to me, so I investigated this one first.

It should be possible to only request metadata for the effected features and properties.

I suppose it would be reasonable to send as little metadata as possible keeping requests and streams small by default. It then should be possible to request an arbitrary amount of metadata. At least it should be possible to request all metadata, or for a whole thing which will make a good start for this.

Maybe always attaching metadata is desired, that's up for debate I'd say. If not always attaching this we have to think about how to configure this in a request.

* https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/rql/query/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/rql/query/criteria/LikePredicateImpl.java is the implementation of `like` - I would copy from that
* look at where the constructor of `LikePredicateImpl` is used - that is `CriteriaFactoryImpl` in the `CriteriaFactory.like(Object)` implementation
   * add another interface method to `CriteriaFactory` for the new like with case insensitivity
* look at where `CriteriaFactory.like(Object)` is used, that is in `ParameterPredicateVisitor`
   * add something new to ParameterPredicateVisitor similar to the existing one for ""like"":
   ```java
   SINGLE_COMPARISON_NODE_MAPPING.put(SingleComparisonNode.Type.LIKE, CriteriaFactory::like);
   ```
* look where `SingleComparisonNode.Type.LIKE` enum value is used
   * that is the Scala based `RqlPredicateParser.like`: https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/rql/parser/src/main/scala/org/eclipse/ditto/rql/parser/internal/RqlPredicateParser.scala#L105
   * add something new for that as well
   * as well as for its usage, etc.
* enhance `PredicateVisitor` and its implementations with the added ""like ignoring case sensitivty"": https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/rql/query/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/rql/query/criteria/visitors/PredicateVisitor.java
   * e.g. `CreateBsonPredicateVisitor` will map that to the MongoDB query which is finally done to search into the DB: https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/thingsearch/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/thingsearch/service/persistence/read/criteria/visitors/CreateBsonPredicateVisitor.java#L94
   ```java
   return fieldName -> Filters.regex(fieldName, valueWithoutLeadingOrTrailingWildcard, """");

The original RQL spec document did not include ""like"", so Ditto added it.
Same as the linked resource.
They use `ilike` for case insensitive search.
Which is also common for SQL.
So I would suggest to introduce ""ilike"". ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85Scdzr/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

My approach:-
1. Create a method in interface **CriteriaFactory** with name **ilike**.
2. implement ilike method in CriteriaFactoryImpl.
3. add ilike functionality similar to like in all the places.
4. create helper function similar to **LikeHelper** and change this line ->

will this work ?

What you proposed is probably a part of the solution, but applying it to the MongoDB query was missing from your suggestion.

Adjusting the in Scala written RQL parser is also something to do.

The reason for this behavior can be found in the supervision strategies of the used `ClusterRouterPool` (which starts the `BaseClientActor`s) and `ConnectionPersistenceActor` (which starts the pool).

The default strategy of the pool is, to escalate failures to the parent.
The default strategy of the `ConnectionPersistenceActor` is, to stop children which fail with a `ActorInitializationException`.

from the error you posted, I assume you're using Windows as OS.
The error you see is from some test code within ditto. A mongo DB should be started automatically for some integration testing against a real database.

For this test the OS will be detected and depending on the used OS the code tries to interact with the docker daemon.
On Windows we expect the daemon to be available on localhost:2375.
So now there are two options which could cause your problem:

1. You use WSL2 to build ditto. AFAIK there are issues with WSL2 and this OS detection we implemented. We didn't fix this, yet.
2. You didn't enable your docker daemon to expose itself on port 2375. This is a setting of docker. Just open the docker settings using the docker tray icon and check if you enabled this.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MzgzMjI1Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1092,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1092,ditto,924629893,1092,Question about the expected behavior of using custom auth-subjects,raujonas,25148277,Jonas Rau,,CLOSED,2021-06-18T07:34:15Z,2021-06-23T06:06:15Z,"Hey there! I've read about the new functionality to create custom auth-subjects (https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/installation-operating.html#openid-connect). I have a question about the expected behavior of this functionality, because my tests do not match my expectations.

What I'm trying to achieve is the usage of groups from keycloak (instead of the sub claim, so that multiple users can easily have access to a thing) which are part of my jwt, for example:
```
 ""groups"": [
    ""b2386a6c-fe10-44d5-82bf-d25e3e4e97b4"",
    ""91e6a873-d9fe-4eef-928f-b7906db06ec9"",

    ""7a580140-f39e-42db-a62c-936e83b55ce5""
  ],
```
I'm also aware of the discussion in #512, that is why I expected that the created policy should have a separate subject for each of the four groups above. However the created policy looks like this (there's only my first group included):
```

I'm starting ditto with the following java parameters:
```
-Dditto.gateway.authentication.oauth.protocol=http 
-Dditto.gateway.authentication.oauth.openid-connect-issuers.keycloak.issuer=keycloak.localhost:8090/auth/realms/custom-realm 
-Dditto.gateway.authentication.oauth.openid-connect-issuers.keycloak.auth-subjects.0='{{ jwt:groups }}'
```

The question now is, is it possible to have a subject created for each of the groups which are part of the jwt or is this the intended behavior and just a misunderstanding on my side? Or is it just a configuration mistake on my side? In my case the number of groups could be dynamic.

Thank you very much for your help again! :blush:

The default implicit policy Ditto creates (eg when creating a thing) will always only include the very first subject, even if the authorization context contained more than one subject. 
That way the first could eg be the user ID, additional ones could be groups. By default we always want to grant as few access as possible. 

You can however create the policy by yourself and use any amount of roles you want in there.

-Dditto.gateway.authentication.oauth.openid-connect-issuers.keycloak.auth-subjects.1='{{ jwt:groups }}'

This is even better than what I had in mind because now the thing can still be created by a user and I can tell who created it in the future, but also give only read access to some groups with a separate policy entry. Great.

This was expected but is not true (hence a bug).
In fact an `InvocationTargetException` is thrown which leads to `FallbackEntityId` as the method's return value.

This exception is documented nowhere and thus most likely not caught until recognised in unit tests, or worse, at runtime.
The rationale for not documenting the exception is the fact that it unknown to `EntityId`.
For example it might be a `ThingIdInvalidException` or a `PolicyIdInvalidException`.
To fix this it makes sense to introduce an `EntityIdInvalidException` which lies next to `EntityId` and thus is known and can be documented.
Furthermore all possible `*IdInvalidException`s should derive from `EntityIdInvalidException`.

Thanks for reply,

But I haven't modify any code yet. Just open dockerd and mvn clean install.
And I want to modify it too.

Thanks for reaching out.

To be honest, searching in JSON arrays was never supported in Ditto's search - we are surprised ourselves that id apparently did work with 1.5.1.
The `in({property},{value},{value},...)` operator in the search [is documented to search in a single scalar property](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-rql.html#in) (see also the example there).

So this is neither a regression nor a intentional drop of support of that feature.
We can look into this at a later point as this has no priority for our use-cases.
If you depend on that feature I suggest to stay at Ditto 1.5.1 or to provide a PullRequest which re-enables (and documents) that feature.

Might I ask: do you use Ditto in a commercial setup?

I think there was a bug before Ditto 2.0 that the configuration hierarchy was wrong, so that the configuration from the config file (which was already `0`, disabling the indexing of arrays) was not applied correctly and the fallback from code (`25`) was used instead.
This was fixed and so the `0` was configured effectively disabling indexing arrays.

This should not be set to a very high number as this could lead to high document sizes in the search index - but you have to try out and find out which value you would need as upper array size limit.

And yes, additional array entries would not be indexed if the array size is greater than the configured limit.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDY4NDk4OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Is it correct to read the data sent to ditto through the HTTP call like ""/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto.example:raspberry"" in raspberry pi and unity?

I'm now saving ditto's past data in MongoDB with Python code via ""/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto.example:raspberry""  HTTP call. Is the way I'm doing it right?

Dittos main point is storing twin information in a MongoDB and making it accessible via multiple different APIs.
One of these APIs could be the HTTP API.

For example you could store your data in a [twin feature](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-feature.html) by using an `HTTP PUT` to `/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto.example:raspberry/features/yourFeatureName` with your JSON data as payload.

Ditto will store this in a MongoDB and makes it accessible to you for example by calling the same endpoint with an `HTTP GET` afterwards.

There is no need (and we strongly advice you not to do this!) to access ditto's MongoDB manually.

If you need more information about our HTTP API feel free to check: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Features

If you want to learn about other APIs of Ditto, like Websocket or different messaging protocols like AMQP, MQTT or Kafka please check: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-overview.html","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C840vaz3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You already define by addressing the policy via the `""policyId""` in the HTTP path, which policy to check. And as inside of the policy there is no ""link"" to a special Thing ID, this makes no sense (the relation is the other way around, the thing points to the policy).

Basically what I think you need: 
* You have a Thing ""namespace:thing-1"" which uses policy ""namespace:policy-1""
* You check if you have `""READ""` permission on ""namespace:thing-1"" by doing `POST /api/2/policies/namespace:policy-1/actions/checkPermissions`

That won't work as the Ditto ""policies"" service/persistence does not track ""backward relations"" and architecturally we don't want it to.

    ""permissions"": [ ""READ"" ]

Maybe it's also useful if I can call that permission check action on a thing and ditto then forwards this to the policy check action with the corresponding thingId. That way I don't have to find out the policyId of a thing first.

When retrieving a thing or feature one could also supply a path parameter to request deviating permissions so if I GET a feature and I'm interested if there are properties on that feature I can't READ or WRITE then I'd like to know that. Similar to the `extraFields` parameter.

The response payload would either just be:
```json
[
  true,
  true,
  false
]
```
Or it would include the whole ""input"" (maybe optionally with a ""verbose"" flag).

And an alternative to that (as JsonArrays are often problematic to handle, using indices, etc.):
```json
{
  ""lamp_reader"": {
    ""resource"": ""thing:/features/lamp/properties/on"",
    ""entityId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:some-thing-1"",
    ""hasPermissions"": [ ""READ"" ]
  },
  ""lamp_toggler"": {
    ""resource"": ""message:/features/lamp/inbox/toggle"",

  },
  ""policy_admin"": {
    ""resource"": ""policy:/"",
    ""entityId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:some-policy-1"",
    ""hasPermissions"": [ ""READ"", ""WRITE"" ]
  }
}
```
Which could (by default) just return a response like:
```json
{
  ""lamp_reader"": true,
  ""lamp_toggler"": true,
  ""policy_admin"": false
}
```

We use 8GB for each connectivity instance and have multiple instances of the connectivity service running.

The ""connection logs"" feature is however quite memory hungry, so you might need more memory when using this.
Please however be aware that the ""connection logs"" are mainly intended for development purposes and that there are no guarantees that log-statements are 100% available and kept.

When you need a reliable logging I suggest to rely on the Ditto service logs: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/installation-operating.html

What you could try is to increase the available memory to give the Java GarbageCollector more resources in order to not do too much GC.

One other point I have to mention: The HTTP endpoint of Ditto's gateway is not intended to directly connect thousands of devices but to provide APIs for web apps and mobile apps.
For connection a high amount of devices, a device connectivity layer is highly suggested, e.g. a MQTT broker or Eclipse Hono which also provides an HTTP endpoint for connecting devices.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C842Dz3e/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As a result, the CPU usage of the connectivity service increased to more than 150%.
And a few hours later, the connectivity service has been down.
The log of the connectivity service are below.

I got the log file from docker container with (""docker-compose logs connectivity > log_file "").
As you said, I tried to find error message from the log file. 
But I could't find the related error message. 
However, it is clear that the connectivity service was disappeared in docker service ( I checked it with ""docker ps"").
So I started to suspect the high load was the cause of the problem.

i have came across the Ditto project and it sounds quite promising. 

Looking at the documentation i could figure out that Ditto's underlying persistency layer uses MongoDB. In our use case i have quite a lot of data coming from the field in form of ""timeseries"" data. To store this sensor data there are other database technologies that we use currently that are optimized for storage and query performance of such kind of timeseries data. 

Also, in our digital twin configuration we save some other twin-specific meta-data, such as pictures, multimedia files, compressed python pickle model files, etc. that do fit much better on a AWS S3 based object storage system than in MongoDB.

My question here is, is it possible to define some attributes (Features) of a Thing in Ditto, so that the data is actually retrieved by other sources, so that when the user queries property x of thing T, then T.x is actually starting a download stream on as ""s3://"" endpoints or even running a SQL query on another DB and collecting the results?

And more in particular: does Ditto support JDBC connectors to perform such kind of queries? This would enable Ditto to connect for example to a Presto backend and thus include support to much more data sources.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1167/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

That (serving files from S3) sounds similar to what is described here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/advanced-data-by-pass.html
Did you have a look on that?

You can e.g. send ""live messages"" via an HTTP endpoint in Ditto `POST /api/2/things/my:thing-1/inbox/messages/my-super-query` which can be either answered by one of your services or e.g. an AWS Lambda function - resulting in a by Ditto correlated HTTP response.
For an S3 integration that would make at most sense in my opinion. 

You could also try to configure a Ditto managed [HTTP connection](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-protocol-bindings-http.html) which does a ""GET"" request to a S3 bucket reacting on ""live messages"". That is however quite advanced and will require a good understanding of Ditto connections.

Ditto itself does not support connecting via JDBC to other databases and retrieving some data there.
That would also be possible with an own microservice processing ""live messages"" responding e.g. with data fetched from a JDBC query.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C842izHo/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

i did indeed have a look at the page mentioned above yesterday night, and it does represent a workaround for REST based communication (which is OK sometimes, but we also use GraphQL in our use case, which does not accept redirects).

The workaround explained in the doc works for GET requests, but would it be possible to write/update values using the same method?

Well, Ditto does provide a REST API .. so you won't be able to invoke a GraphQL API on Ditto's HTTP endpoints ;)

Yes, that's exactly what it can do/does. The data you transmit e.g. in the `POST` request of the message is then available for the subscriber of that message, which can be:
* a WebSocket session
* a Ditto managed connection (e.g. calling a foreign HTTP endpoint providing the data as well as ""POST"" payload - using the response and the status code of the foreign HTTP endpoint as status and payload of the Ditto HTTP request)

> As for the S3 integration, i will have a look, especially because we prefer using MinIO as open source counterpart to S3 and thus have to see how lambdas would work there.

Using Lambda is not a requitement, you can also directly access the S3 bucket via HTTP I suppose.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C842i_43/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am currently still evaluating how Ditto could fit in our current use case and will try to make experiments for such kind of integrations later on.

I will probably post on this same issue if that is possible, as soon as i have updates. For the time being, if you can point me to any other piece of documentation / blog article, or similar, that could help me get a better understanding on how to integrate Ditto in existing Machine Learning / Big Data systems and how does it fit in a Digital Twin environment, that would be beneficial.

So far i have just had a look at the documentation and webinars online, but i could only find very specific technical details on the technology in there, not really on the way it integrates in existing architectures, or related use cases.

POST /api/2/things/io.eclipseprojects.ditto:my-motion-detector-1/features/motion-detection/outbox/messages/motion-detected`
```

However, messages may only be received using:
* WebSocket channel
* a managed Connection (e.g. publishing messages via Kafka, AMQP, HTTP, MQTT, etc.)

It would be very convenient - and could also be specified in scope of a WoT (Web of Things) Thing Descriptions - to subscribe for messages via SSE.

For example, opening a SSE channel (with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`) on this HTTP resource would subscribe to all messages with subject `motion-detected` emitted via the `outbox` (sent *from* the device):
```
GET /api/2/things/io.eclipseprojects.ditto:my-motion-detector-1/features/motion-detection/outbox/messages/motion-detected`
```

Whenever a ""motion-detected"" message would be emitted, the established SSE channel would be notified receiving the message's payload.
Put in SSE's `event` field the message name, e.g. `motion-detected`.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1186/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Say you're using following configuration options:

Previously when you configured a URI you had to urlEncode the username and password:

Right now, you have to configure the URI with double urlEncoded username and password:

I would start looking at `org.eclipse.ditto.connectivity.service.messaging.mqtt.hivemq.AbstractHiveMqttClientFactory.configureSimpleAuth()` - that's where the password is passed into the used HiveMQ MQTT client.
Maybe HiveMQ MQTT client needs the password URL encoded when there are spaces in it.

Could however also be that the password is URL decoded before it reaches this place.

Another suspicious place is `org.eclipse.ditto.connectivity.model.ImmutableConnection$ConnectionUri.tryDecodeUriComponent(String)` where the password is URL decoded when being read from the URI string.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C843rTb_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Seems that the gateway is unable to download the public key from the jwks_uri (i guess). but it is there (with the key given in the gateway log).

Tried everything, including debug mode logging, but no result.
I see in the gateway config file an example with Auth0, so i guess this must be working. Any help is appreciated!

What do the DEBUG logs say? The class [DittoPublicKeyProvider](https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/gateway/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/gateway/service/security/authentication/jwt/DittoPublicKeyProvider.java) logs DEBUG statements for every step when retrieving and parsing the public key, e.g. this one:

Seems that this indeed fails.
Do you run Ditto in containers? Are those allowed to do an HTTP call to the outside world or do you have any networking policies in place?

The debug logs are not very extensive, hope i'm missing something important that leads to the issue.
When attaching to the container (pod) i can access the url for the auth0 tenant, fi, i can do a wget on the openid-configuration and get the complete json from inside the container.

The most likely possibility is that the exception here is thrown and silently dropped (by the cache loader which invoked the method):
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/0d3ae1a08af2999a8844b5a85c08ade11c398607/gateway/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/gateway/service/security/authentication/jwt/DittoPublicKeyProvider.java#L136

I think that this most likely is related to the Ditto helm chart.
Maybe some quotes are missing around the ""args"", I just rendered the k8s template and got the following output:

You wrote:
```

On the other hand a simple scenario like: _use the twin state if it is quite up-to-date, otherwise use the live channel_ is currently not supported by ditto and would need extra requests when implemented externally.

Similar to the [""conditional requests""](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-conditional-requests.html) already in place, add a more advanced mechanism to support _reads_ with channel selection (twin/live) based on a condition.

Example:
```
GET /api/2/things/<thingId>/features/foo/properties/status
            &condition=eq(""attributes/type"",""foo"")
            &liveChannelCondition=or(

To my understanding, that rule came from the Java package naming, which also doesn't allow a dash, but underscores.

If that is the only reason, and there is no technical reason, I would ask to consider allowing dashes too. I don't think it violates the overall principal of IDs that Ditto follows:

Guide:
- I had seen a demo of the integration working on @thjaeckle 's laptop but without that or reading until the end of this document with the curl requests, it is not clear what the integration means. I think adding something like ""This integration allows for Ditto clients or usual WoT clients to obtain TDs for the Ditto-managed twins"" or like what is described in https://www.w3.org/WoT/developers/ ""Ditto managed digital twins can be linked to WoT Thing Models from which Ditto can create Thing Descriptions containing the API descriptions of the twins. ""
- Multiple places use thing without capital T. My suggestion would be to always capitalize it to differentiate WoT/IoT Things from colloquial use of the word thing.
- I find the point and subpoints at https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/6ebbe7e2da9c7f82405ab7676c1f43358d464eba/documentation/src/main/resources/pages/ditto/basic-wot-integration.md?plain=1#L79 a bit confusing:
> if backed by a WoT Thing Model, the twin will tell you as response exactly
        what it is capable of
        which HTTP endpoints to invoke to access data / send messages

I do not understand what is meant by the response. Also, TMs do not necessarily have HTTP endpoints and this documentation even says that at https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/6ebbe7e2da9c7f82405ab7676c1f43358d464eba/documentation/src/main/resources/pages/ditto/basic-wot-integration.md?plain=1#L54

- The points under `The benefits of adding such a “Thing Model” reference to digital twins managed in Ditto are:` start with a different form of a sentence, i.e. some start with a verb, some with a noun, the last two change from a singular person to a plural person (lack of `s` at the verb)

- At https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/6ebbe7e2da9c7f82405ab7676c1f43358d464eba/documentation/src/main/resources/pages/ditto/basic-wot-integration.md?plain=1#L83 it would be better to always write JSON instead of Json . This happens in other places as well

- At https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/6ebbe7e2da9c7f82405ab7676c1f43358d464eba/documentation/src/main/resources/pages/ditto/basic-wot-integration.md?plain=1#L87
    - perform -> performs
    - it would be nice to say that even the meeting minutes are totally public and that specifications develop over GitHub, making it open to review. I am a bit ""nitpicky"" about this since way too many standards claim that they are open but in the end, only the pdf/webpage of the standard is available for free.

* Gateway and
* Concierge

The plan that came to my mind is to move the HTTP API and also command authorization to the respective service the command is related to. So each of the remaining services will have an HTTP API and handles the authorization inside their service instead of concierge.
Remaining services would be:
* Things
* Policies (Not sure if this really needs to be a separate service. Maybe something that should be discussed)
* Things-Search
* Connectivity

Of course this should not be reimplemented for all services but instead we could introduce a library for common HTTP / Authorization  topics and only implement the specific parts in the respective service.

Benefits:
* Reduce complexity of understanding the interaction between the services
* More self contained services. Gateway for example depends right now on Things, Policies, Things-Search and Concierge. This service is basically useless without those other services. With the new apporach. We have a completely independent policy service and a completely independent connectivity service. Only Things-Search (Things) and Things (Policies) do still have dependencies on other services.
* More stable deployments: akka http does already provide a way to finish open http requests during coordinated shutdown. Right now this is a problem because a http request crosses multiple services to be finished (e.g. gateway -> concierge -> things). So when the concierge service was restarted this caused a lot of failing requests.
* Reduced overhead because of an additional container

Downsides:
* Containers probably will be ""bigger"", meaning they will need more memory and most likely also more CPU. (I expect lesser resource consumption overall). We could also horizontally scale the remaining services in order to reduce the amout of memory per service. I think we should analyze what fits best here.

Please feel free to add arguments for or against this change. (Of course this would require a Ditto 3.0 release)

Benefit would also be that json serialization and deserialization in the cluster will be reduced a lot.
And this saves a lot of CPU.

We could also look into improving the HTTP ingress/load balancer to detect the things cluster node where eg a thing with ID x is running to directly route the Http request to the correct node.
This will again save network hops and serialization overhead.
Where the akka shards are currently located can be determined via a HTTP call to the akka management api.
That could eg be updated each minute by a custom ingress controller or load balancer.

E.g. the gateway provides routes which are not directly related to an entity:
* `/ws/2`
* `/api/2/cloudevents`

Those 2 endpoints - similar to ""connectivity"" - directly process Ditto Protocol messages for all entities (things + policies + search commands).
So at least for those, we would still require the ""gateway"".

So FMPOV we could get of ""concierge"", but would still require the edges ""gateway"" and ""connectivity"".
Direct access to things/policies with a known ID could still be optimized to directly target the services (with an additional clever ingress/loadbalancing).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C84_5qH3/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

1. The mentioned headers do not have static default values which could be specified, however:
   * if `content-type` is missing from the headers, `application/json` will be assumed for commands - for messages, `application/octet-stream` will be assumed
   * `correlation-id` will be generated (in UUID format) if none was provided
   * `ditto-originator` cannot be set by a device/application at all, but will always be set by the Ditto backend with the ""authorization subject that caused an event""
   * `if-match` and `if-none-match` don't have defaults - if they are missing, no [conditional request](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-concepts.html#conditional-requests) will be performed
   * `version` - as Ditto only supports version 2 currently, this will be 2 if omitted - I will fix the spec which says that this may be 1 or 2
2. Yes, some headers have restrictions - you can find the used validators here (as last argument of the header enum value): https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/master/base/model/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/base/model/headers/DittoHeaderDefinition.java
   * e.g. `timeout` header uses the `HeaderValueValidators.getTimeoutValueValidator()` which uses `DittoDuration.parseDuration()`: https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/e30d9f93e820d6dcab143727590a44bec7f4f7f9/base/model/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/base/model/common/DittoDuration.java#L61-L77
      a ""range"" is however not enforced currently
   * the `correlation-id` header uses  the `HeaderValueValidators.getNonEmptyValidator()` - so no, it may not be empty
   * etc.

I have a feature like `features/myFeature/properties/myProperty` of type string.
I then want to filter all things where `myProperty` ends with `123`.

Two requests are made: one request for the **count** and one for **things**.

**count:**
`search/things/count?filter=like(features/myFeature/properties/myProperty,""*123"")`

**things:** 
`search/things?option=size(25)&filter=like(features/myFeature/properties/myProperty,""*123"")`

**count** returns for example `45`.
**things** responds with 25 things in `items` as i expected, since the filter matches with 45 things according to **count** and i know from manual verification, that 45 is valid. Since 45 > 25 page 1 is ""full"".

So i expect to be able to fetch a second page by sending a second **things** request including the `cursor-id` from the first request:

**things-page-2:**
`search/things?option=size(25),cursor({cursor-id})&filter=like(features/myFeature/properties/myProperty,""*123"")`

The response from **things-page-2**:
{""items"":[],""nextPageOffset"":-1}

This happens for other properties and page sizes as well.

When doing some sorting with `sort(+` i had to replace the `+` with `%2B` manually since the angular HttpUrlEncoder leaves me no choice other than doing some custom replacement. Escaping etc. does not work especially for `+`. 
If i do not replace it i get the following error because angular just removes it:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102803905/161284648-e6489f26-630f-4409-b272-f0d8805d2bfb.png)

This works fine until it comes to filtering with the `*` or `?`

What i just found out: If make an ascending sort with `-` or not using any sort at all it is working. Everything else in the request remains the same:

**No sort (works):**
`search/things?option=size(25),cursor(eJwVj...tLw)&filter=like(features/myFeature/properties/myProperty,%22*123%22)`

**Asc sort (does not work):**
`search/things?option=sort(%2Battributes/myAttribute),size(25),cursor(eJw...4mw)&filter=like(features/myFeature/properties/myProperty,%22*123%22)`

**Desc sort (works):**
`search/things?option=sort(-attributes/myAttribute),size(25),cursor(eJw...4mw)&filter=like(features/myFeature/properties/myProperty,%22*123%22)`

Actually i thought i tried it out without sorting, but no sort send the Asc sort request. So thats on me^^

[Here ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45428842/angular-url-plus-sign-converting-to-space)you see the Angular problem. My current workaround with the `%2B` seems to trigger some interpretation change on ditto regarding the `*` and `?`.

**Edit:**
I would like to not make some URL interception workaround to add the `+` through some hack.

This pattern allows to define indices on fields, for which the keys are arbitrary and not known in advance (like feature properties or attributes). However, this approach has some downsides: authorization subjects allowed to read a property or an attribute are copied multiple times and the whole thing structure is duplicated to allow sorting by arbitrary properties or attributes. As a result, the size of an index document is a multiple of the original thing structure, which leads to very slow updates and queries.

In order to improve this situation, we decided to leverage the [wildcard index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-wildcard/) feature introduced with MongoDB 4.2, which allows to build an index and query against fields, whose names are not known in advance. At the same time we reduce the duplication of authorization subjects in the search index document to further reduce its size.

What it does - it saves incoming message along with its content type to feature named ""telemetry"". Another connection will then pick up this event and process it (currently it forwards the telemetry to event hub).
Azure IoT Hub provides property ""iothub-connection-device-id"" which contains device ID that sent the message. This property is provided as message annotation on AMQP connection.

The problem is that I do not see message annotations in headers in payload mapping script or ""enforcement"" section. That's why ""device-id"" was introduced using Azure IoT Hub message enrichment feature with value ""$twin.tags.deviceId"". But this is a workaround and requires creating tag on each device.

So, how can I get device ID in this connection from message annotations?

_Note: forwarding telemetry using Azure IoT Hub message routing feature is not an option as there will be other devices connected to Ditto not through IoT Hub._","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1389/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* I think type should be something more like `org.eclipse.ditto.v2`
* Maybe it makes sense to use the `datacontenttype` to indicate it is something ditto specific?
* Maybe it makes sense to check for the `dataschema` to start with `ditto:`, like it is already done by the HTTP endpoint: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/CloudEvents/post_cloudevents
* I know we discussed this, but I am unsure about putting the topic into the subject field (see below)

Questions

* I don't see how the headers are mapped in general (where does the ""correlation ID"" come from? where would other headers be stored?)
* How would a ""binary"" data section be handled? It might happen (and be valid) that a data section comes as binary or text and still is valid JSON. Would that be handled properly?

Depending on where the Ditto headers are stored, I think it might make sense to consider the cloud events only as a wrapper/envelope and not store any ditto information in its structures (outside of data). Meaning that the topic would not go into the subject. That might be a very simple approach to start with, and by evaluating the `type` field, it would be possible later on to introduce another format which does that differently.

Of course if would also be possible to just copy the cloud events extensions/attributes (header name minus the `ce`) into the Ditto headers section.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85HPaCU/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I would have expected that the `datacontenttype`is the IANA registered content type for Ditto Protocol:
https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-specification.html#content-type

And that `data`would simply be a Ditto Protocol message.
I don't see benefits in defining another structure for the CloudEvent which needs another mapping back to Ditto Protocol.

Headers could of course be another thing where eg the protocol headers are copied over to the Ditto Headers as also @ctron mentioned.

So what is the idea of what the benefit is with the proposed structure instead of using Ditto Protocol?

Well what I was trying to do was finding a way to maybe use CloudEvent specs more in tandem with the Ditto Protocol. However, it does look like it has no benefit per se so maybe putting a ditto protocol message inside ```data``` field is better

Attached the files we are trying to deploy , (some private information are blurred).

sorry for the delayed response.
After looking at the code where this is happening it seems very weird that a ClassCastException would come.
Without a reproducer it would be very hard to investigate further.
Also is this 2.4.0 image the official ditto image from docker hub or is it one built locally with the release-2.4 branch and pushed to your local registry?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85HLGJp/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Sounds good. 👍 

And how exactly do you expect us to solve your problem? We also do not have access to your customer's EKS cluster.
Do you expect to get paid for setting up Ditto and get free premium support here?

If you cannot reproduce locally, we also can't.
So I suggest that you try to reproduce on an AWS EKS by yourself, maybe also with the restrictions your customer did set up.

We did not do a ""diff"" of the Helm files you sent - please do this ""diff"" yourself and respond with the changes you made to the chart.
Maybe we can then get an idea of what the cause might be - however I somehow doubt that this problem is based in the Helm chart.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85HVbtV/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is quite cumbersome as the response is ""wrapped"" into a JSON envelope and e.g. the actual ""statusCode"" is a field in that JSON payload instead of being reflected as real HTTP status code.

This issue proposes to add a new HTTP API in order to manage connections, e.g.:
```
POST      /api/2/connections
GET       /api/2/connections/<connectionId>
PUT       /api/2/connections/<connectionId>

GET       /api/2/connections/<connectionId>/metrics
GET       /api/2/connections/<connectionId>/logs
```

This should reflect all available Connection commands with a HTTP endpoint.
The authentication of this API should be done with the Ditto ""devops"" user - as connections currently do not forsee having a ""policyId"" and this would lead to much effort adding the ""policyId"" to connections.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1406/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

```
GET /api/2/search/things?filter=eq(attributes/manufacturer,'Eclipse')&fields=thingId

I'm observing some strange behavior of the search API: doing a request with or without filters to the /count endpoint yields a different number than the result of the /search query (using the same request, only different endpoints).

**Example 1:**

I have a realm with roughly 2200 things in about 150 policies. Maybe it's related to permissions?

I see that although the count returns around 2200, the first page of the /search request with a `size(200)` option only returns 191 items. The next page then has 200 items. If I inverse the sort order to descending, the first page has 200 results.

**Example 2:**

In this example what's notable is that inversing the sort order does not change the number of results in the first page. I'm not sure yet why this is.

```
GET /search/things/count
=> 1074
GET /search/things
=> 25
GET /search/things&option=size(25)
=> 25
GET /search/things&option=size(150)
=> 145
GET /search/things&option=size(200)
=> 191
GET /search/things&option=size(200)&sort(-)
=> 191
```
**More testing:**

It seems that the /search/things endpoint gathers some things it does not return. It computes a bucket of 200 things but skips certain one of them. I'm currently investigating what those things are and which differences they have to the ones that are included in the search result.

The deprecated `limit` option behaves the same as `size,cursor`

**Reproduction:**

I was not yet able to reproduce this on the sandbox instance. So unfortunately I do not have a reproducer just yet. Any help in debugging / coming up with a repro is appreciated.

That was due to the nature of the chosen ""attribute pattern"" (together with only partially updating the index by doing array ""splices"", etc.) we applied in the MongoDB for building the generic search index.
Among other performance issues of the ""old search"" we fixed this problem with the new ""wildcard index"" approach in #1374

So this should be fixed for Ditto 3.0.0 as well.
Backporting the fix to 2.4 is unfortunately not possible as the complete DB schema of the search changed - that's also one of the reasons for a new major version of Ditto.

I'm using the official [Helm Chart](https://github.com/eclipse/packages/tree/master/charts/ditto) to run ditto. 

I'm not sure how to integrate the entity-creation config. 

What I've tried so far issSetting the config via systemProps. I was not sure which service is responsible for restricting enity creation. So I added it to all services.

values.yaml
```yaml
gateway:
  systemProps:
      - ""-Dditto.entity-creation.grant.0.auth-subjects.0=admins:role/admin""
policies:
  systemProps:

connectivity:

```

This doesn't work.

I've also tried adding `- ""-Dditto.entity-creation.revoke.0={}""` and hoped this would revoke entity creation for all users. Had no success on this. 

The helm chart does not supply any options to add configuration files to the services. So also no luck with this. 

Do you have any Tipps?


Edit:

I've modified the helm chart in order to add a `ditto-entity-creation.conf` into  the working directory (opt/ditto) of each service. 

ditto-entity-creation.conf:
```
ditto.entity-creation {
  grant = [
      {
        resource-types = [],
        namespace = []

  revoke = [

Thanks for trying out Ditto.
You are right - with the linked documentation at 
https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/installation-operating.html#restricting-entity-creation
you won't be able to configure the entity-creation correctly.

That is the latest ""development"" documentation (also as stated in the upper left of the site) and we recently adjusted for the upcoming Ditto 3.0 the configuration.
For Ditto 2.4 (which you are most likely using), please find the documentation here:
https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2.4/installation-operating.html#restricting-entity-creation

You only have to configure the system-property for the ""concierge"" service (which will be removed from Ditto 3.0 - that's why we had to adjust the configuration as well) - and you did it already correctly:
```yaml
concierge:
  systemProps:
      - ""-Dditto.concierge.enforcement.entity-creation.grant.0.auth-subjects.0=admins:role/admin""
```

That will cause that only a user which somehow received the ""auth subject"" `""admins:role/admin""` may create ""policies"" and ""things"".","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85IshF-/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The solution in my mind was to store the last environment of a user in the browser cache - like with all other user specific settings. The Swagger-UI solution looks powerful. So you are thinking to allow to configure all environments and the default environment from outside? Interestingly enough Swagger does not save any user or browser specific data.

I think a user should be able to change his personal settings directly in the UI. A way to share the settings of one user with others is also very useful, but I don't see spontaneously a way to combine both approaches (one idea was to store the environment configuration in a thing for each environment but that is another completely different approach).

You see, I am a bit confused now. Need to think about it and some further discussion would be helpful, too. Thanks.

* The environment templates should be moved to the templates folder (they are currently in the environments.js)
* The environment templates are loaded only the very first time on one browser instance. As soon as a user does any change on any environment (e.g. just authenticates), all environments are taken from the browser store. You will never get an update on the templates again until you clear your browser cache. That is not good. At least each of the environments should be stored independently

Next to that an environment stores different types of data:

1. environment configuration itself (url, solutionId, namespace, ditto-version, etc.): not user specific, should be shared
2. Authorization header (to switch the headers when you switch the environment): should NOT be shared.
3. Fieldlist: the field definitions should be shared with others, while the selection and order of columns is user specific
4. Filterlist: user specific but may also be shared
5. pinned things: very user specific
6. Message Templates: similar to field list, these are not user specific

So as a first solution idea:
* Separate 1 from 2 - 6
* 1 can be configured via url parameter:
  * `environmentsURL` -> link to a json with all environments. If not given, the file from templates folder will be used
  * `primaryEnvironmentName` -> as desired
  * can not be changed by the user
* 2 - 6 will still be stored per browser (referring with the environmentName)
* A user can create additional environments that are stored per browser

What is missing:
* ""my last environment"" stored in the browser cache. We could still do that and just override the primaryEnvironmentName?
* All environments are still in one json - so no way to specify `environmentURLs`
* A possibility to share 3,4 and 6 (similar like in Jira or Postman)
* 2 should be handled by the browser pw manager (Chrome is giving a warning there). Don't know the details here.

My thoughts regarding the shared vs. local environments:
* maybe a user ""modified"" environment can ""link to"" the URL of the environment it was created from
   * and a user modified environment could overwrite any fields/config from the shared environment
* the 2 environments (""shared"" and local from browser storage) are merged with the local one having precedence
* that way, changes to the ""shared"" environment could be applied, if not explicitly overwritten

Regarding storing the authentication information in the local storage:
I think we must rethink that ...
I did not think about this previously, but this raises some security concerns.

The local browser storage can be accessed by every other webapp running on the same domain, right?
So for the Ditto-UI deployed on ""eclipse.github.io/ditto"" this would mean that each other GitHub pages web-app can access them (similar to cookies).

It works for around 70 - 80% of messages that I sent, but some messages are just missing.

I have tried other many configurations: adding `twin-persisted`, removing `reply-to`, etc. But none of them have made any difference.

The messages that I have in `main.ditto.topic` are `modify` commands, like this:

```
{
  ""path"": ""/the/path"",
  ""headers"": {

    }
  ]
}
```

So I expected to see some kind of response (as it happens for other things. I can see some information logged in `ditto-connectivity`, but there is nothing on the `response.ditto.topic`. Here's what I see in the logs:

```

Do those 70-80% relate to your described use case? Or are there other messages included?
Im asking because of

> It looks like Ditto didn't try to reply at all.

Is this meant for a single message that did not receive a response? Or for the described use case as a whole?

Also: have you tried to [enable connection logging](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#enable-connection-logs) and [retrieve them](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#retrieve-connection-logs) after you ran your test?

The [connection metrics](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#retrieve-connection-logs) could also be of interest to track this issue down.

Please note that the maximum timeout for messages in ditto is 60s. So maybe reducing the timeout from 1800s to 60s could already solve the problem, but I still would expect at least an error response indicating this. Also the reply-to header should not be required, but also doesn't hurt.

Thanks for your reply. I have updated the connection to use `60s` as timeout. I also have some new findings.

Regarding

> Do those 70-80% relate to your described use case? Or are there other messages included?

I can add some more details to the type of test that I'm doing. So we send, let's say, 10000 `modify` commands to Ditto in a given point of time. Each one has its own identifier. They are read by the connector and in case that the thing doesn't exist, we expect that Ditto will send a 404 response message to `response.ditto.topic`. So in the worst case where none of the things can be found, we expect to receive 10000 responses with 404 response code. However, we receive only 70 to 80% of these messages. That's 7000 - 8000 messages. For the rest, there is no response at all in the Kafka topic.

I have enabled the connection logging but there is not much of information, as given the amount of messages, the logs retrieved are just a small amount.

Now, I have increased the amount of `ditto-connectivity` instances (to 6) and I can see a general improvement. I also increased the `clientCount` to 6 in the connection configuration. I got 100% response messages. So now my feeling is that Ditto drops some messages when it can't handle them. What do you think? How can I prove this point?

Moreover, is there any relation that you might already know between the amount of instances that I need given an amount of messages?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85JONkh/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, Ditto (must) drops messages when we can not get them quickly to Kafka, see the config:
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/fc6f942b8c0c6df1ffb903116f9dc45e9c613829/connectivity/service/src/main/resources/connectivity.conf#L545-L552

If Ditto wouldn't drop, it would at some point crash with out-of-memory errors.

However, to mitigate that, you can configure the ""consumer"" to throttle when receiving messages from Kafka (which is deactivated by default):
https://github.com/eclipse/ditto/blob/fc6f942b8c0c6df1ffb903116f9dc45e9c613829/connectivity/service/src/main/resources/connectivity.conf#L436-L462

Or you can scale out via ""clientCount"" (like you did) - or you can increase the ""producer"" queue size how much messages Ditto will queue.

I am however wondering: Is this a real scenario?
That a Kafka already has 10.000 messages persisted which Ditto should process when connecting to it?
Or do you just use that to easily simulate a load test? Because that is not a realistic scenario, or is it? Messages are processed all the time and such ""huge"" batches should not occur.
If they do, then yes .. Ditto must be probably scaled as well.

> Moreover, is there any relation that you might already know between the amount of instances that I need given an amount of messages?

That depends on so many factors (message size, involved optional payload mapping, assigned CPUs of the connectivity instances, performance of the network, scaling of other Ditto services, performance of the database, etc.).
So: ""it depends"". ;)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85JOiqe/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes, correct. Do you have an idea how an automatic tuning of these parameters could look like? We're always open for improvement suggestions. 

> Now, we have also faced some issue where I can't find things if I use the `/search/things` API but I do find them if I use the `thing` API with the specific ID. Why is this even possible? 

This is possible because the search needs its own database / Mongo collection to put a search index over all the things, including their permissions based on the used policies.
The search provides only eventual consistency. 

In the upcoming Ditto 3.0 this search index will massively improve in both performance and consistency.
Also fixing bugs in Ditto 2.x regarding skipped search index updates.
As this new search in Ditto 3.0 also required to change the database schema, backporting to Ditto 2.x is unfortunately not possible.

Yes, we also read the ""news"" today .. very sad to see that decision, even if I can somehow understand it.
Investing so many resources as Lightbend did over the years in Akka and (probably) getting very little ""back"" from most of the commercial users .. that's one of the fundamental things which are broken about FOSS .. :/

You are right, the Eclipse Ditto project will probably be stuck on Akka 2.6.20 for the time being. Maybe a community driven fork of Akka with Apache-2.0 license will be done, let's see.
The good news is that Akka 2.6 is very mature and stable - in the past we almost never hat the ""urge"" to update to a newer Akka version.

However - there could some day of course be a security issue which would require a patch.

Do you mean that the Eclipse Ditto project should apply for such an ""Additional Use Grant"" for being allowed to use latest Akka artifacts with BSL 1.1?
I currently can't imagine how this can work in practice, to be honest, as the new license is no OpenSource license.

Users of Ditto do not get in touch with Akka at all - and the Eclipse Ditto project ""gave back"" to the OSS community by making it available as OpenSource and not keeping it behind closed doors.
However - Ditto is not a ""hobby project"" and mainly used in commercial setups, so I wonder if commercial Ditto users could use Akka underneath ""for free"".","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85J4CSe/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I agree. But the same is likely to be true for users of the Play Framework which is granted commercial use.

For the sake of completeness:
There is this other FOSS project residing under the Eclipse umbrella called [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) which is somewhat similar to several aspects of Akka:
* reactive multi-actor model
* distributed actors with location transparency through an event bus
* mature ecosystem of libraries integrating into the framework

AFAIK [Eclipse Hono](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/) is already using it under the hood through [Quarkus](https://github.com/quarkusio).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85J4KB9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I assume a rewrite would take dozens of person years of time.
And I am quite sure that not everything which Akka (e.g. in clustering/sharding/ddata/persistence/streams) offers can be replaced with just Vert.x.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85J4OfF/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I however fear that even with that grant it is very difficult to include BSL licensed artifacts in an OpenSource project.

For the time being we would like to state the following:
* Eclipse Ditto will stay on Apache-2.0 licensed Akka 2.6
* for the next year Akka 2.6 will receive security and critical bugfixes, see [FAQ](https://www.lightbend.com/akka/license-faq)
   * > Will critical vulnerabilities and bugs be patched in 2.6.x?
Yes, critical security updates and critical bugs will be patched in Akka v2.6.x under the current Apache 2 license until September of 2023.
* after that, Ditto will mitigate encountered critical security bugs in Ditto's codebase, as Ditto completely ""hides"" its Akka usage (e.g. in its Client APIs)
* if a community driven fork of Akka is done, Ditto will move to using the fork","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85KyIki/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The request is waiting for a response to that message from ""the device"" behind the twin.

When sending a message via HTTP, someone needs to receive that message and respond with a correlated message response.
This response is sent back using the ""open"" HTTP request .. 
If no response is sent during the default timeout of 60 seconds, the request will terminate with 408 (request timeout).

So you need to subscribe for messages, e.g. using WebSocket or a connection or SSE - and once receiving the message, send back a message response.
I think that however sending back a response via SSE is not possible, so I would recommend to use the WebSocket.
Or even the Ditto Java or JavaScript client.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85LPhEq/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

* https://blog.softwaremill.com/3-reasons-to-adopt-event-sourcing-89cb855453f6
* https://eventuate.io/whyeventsourcing.html

Ditto however does not yet make much use of that persistence paradigm.
I would like to propose to provide APIs to be able to retrieve a stream of persisted events from the ""event journal"".
That can be useful e.g. in order to:
* replay events which were ""missed"" (similar to what Apache Kafka provides)
* query the changes made to a single property value of a thing
* get an ""audit log"" of changes done to a thing/policy/connection

The API would only be available in a streaming way, so for:
* SSE 
* WebSocket via DittoProtocol
* Connections via DittoProtocol

The DittoProtocol API should be very similar to the [search protocol](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-specification-things-search.html).

As the Ditto background cleanup would delete events quite fast, we would also need a configuration of a ""event-retention duration"" - so it would be possible to configure how long to keep events and snapshots in the DB before finally deleting them via the cleanup.
Example: 7 days

An idea how the SSE API could look like:
```
/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:thing-2?fromRevision=0&fields=thingId,attributes,_revision,_modified
```
The stream would automatically end when the most recent event was returned.

This API could be provided for things, policies and connections (for connections however probably only available via piggyback commands).
The idea would be to use either:
* the *_revision* number of the entity as ""from/to"" selector
* or the *_modified* timestamp of the event journal entry (which is included in the the MongoDB `_id` field)

With the timestamp, a query could look like:

```

We will describe our idea clearly. At the present, we try to utilize Ditto as IoT digital twin of autonomous vehicles in our project. 
We can gain the state data of every vehicle in motion such as speed, steering wheel angle…… and meanwhile group all the state to JSON format as a thing and send it directly to Ditto through MQTT protocol. In the process of autonomous driving, every vehicle could be identified by one unique Thing-ID, but the state data may change continuously and new data would overwrite the old frequently. However, for autonomous driving, the historical data can not only help to monitor vehicle movement as reference, but also provide data for autonomous driving algorithm research especially about perceiving, planning and safety guaranteeing. That’s why we need historical data sincerely. 
We believe that an API to exactly get this information will be useful and hope Ditto can keep the complete historical data in the database at least one week before cleaning it up, which allows us plenty of time to export it.

Not in a reliable way, no.
If this is an option, you could of course create a [connection](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-connections.html) to push out all (change) events to the twin to another system where to process the history .. e.g. to an HTTP endpoint or via an Apache Kafka.

I think you're confusing the connection status endpoint (https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#retrieve-connection-status) wit the connection log endpoint.

Via the connection log endpoint you should also be able to see the inbound messages of the connection. If that is not the case, your connection is not receiving any messages from your Kafka broker.

After restarting Kafka the connection was succesful .

How ever , it does not show any reason why message of creating / modify thing is not working .

As per the above log status Kafka connection is succesful 

I have dropped below message following the Ditto Protocol Structure Defined

Ideally this should modify my existing thing with thingId ""org.eclipse.ditto:fancy-car"" but its not modifying . Also Iam not sure whether ditto consumed the message and failed or Ditto did not consume at all !

Am I still missing something ?

connection was succesful with no message post restart .

When I manually listen to Kafka - I can see multiple messages in the topic . How ever Ditto is not reading anything .

Does it need any policy updates to work with Kafka and read the messages ? because Iam using only default policy created with the helloworld thing creation for the fancy car example .

In order to CRUD your things via the connection the connections authorizationContext needs permissions in the things policy. I however doubt that that is the problem here because you would see a corresponding log in your connection.

Like stated earlier your connection doesn't seem to get any inbound messages. If you validated that your Kafka Broker publishes them correctly (If I get that correct you did that by subscribing manually to the topic), the most likely place where there could be a problem is in the connection configuration. (And there likely in the Source configuration.)

Can you check again that you configured the source correctly and followed the guide: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/connectivity-protocol-bindings-kafka2.html#source-format

1. Are you sure that the IP-Adress specified in your connection resolves to the correct Kafka broker? (In my case I used localhost:9092 since I run my broker in a local docker container)
2. Are you sure you created the zookeper topic correctly (Running `/opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper SERVER-IP:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic testTopic` in the broker container does that perfectly fine for me)

Assuming the local Kafka installation with VM has a problem .

I have tried a managed Kafka Connecting with Eclipse Ditto this time.

Below are the steps I have replicated .

1. Created a org.eclipse.ditto:fancy-car following the example given 
_-----------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/intro-hello-world.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. using the policy nginx :ditto I have created a connection to managed confluent kafka (Apache 2.X) as my local Kafka is not working .
with below connection 
{
  ""id"": ""kafka123"",
  ""name"": ""Kafka Connection"",
  ""connectionType"": ""kafka"",
  ""connectionStatus"": ""open"",
  ""uri"": ""tcp://pkc-6ojv2.us-west4.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092"",
  ""sources"": [
    {
      ""addresses"": [
        ""testTopic""
      ],
      ""consumerCount"": 1,
      ""qos"": 1,
      ""authorizationContext"": [
        ""nginx:ditto""
      ],
      ""acknowledgementRequests"": {
        ""includes"": []
      },
      ""headerMapping"": {},
      ""payloadMapping"": [
        ""Ditto""
      ],
      ""replyTarget"": {
        ""enabled"": false
      }
    }
  ],
  ""targets"": [],
  ""clientCount"": 1,
  ""failoverEnabled"": true,
  ""validateCertificates"": true,
  ""processorPoolSize"": 1,
  ""specificConfig"": {
    ""saslMechanism"": ""plain"",
    ""bootstrapServers"": ""pkc-6ojv2.us-west4.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092""
  },
  ""tags"": []
}

these Kafka Topics are unsecured and accessible for next 10 days if you want to replicate .

3. then published messages in Ditto protocol as explained 

{ ""topic"": ""fancycar/2/things/twin/commands/modify"", ""headers"": { ""correlation-id"": ""112211"", ""content-type"": ""application/vnd.eclipse.ditto+json"" }, ""path"": ""/"", ""value"": { ""thingId"": ""facncycar:2"", ""policyId"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:fancy-car"", ""definition"": ""org.eclipse.ditto:SomeModel:1.0.0"", ""attributes"": { ""location"": { ""latitude"": 44.673856, ""longitude"": 8.261719 } }, ""features"": { ""accelerometer"": { ""properties"": { ""x"": 3.141, ""y"": 2.718, ""z"": 1, ""unit"": ""g"" }, ""desiredProperties"": { ""x"": 4 } } } } }

I have tried replicating similar use case with MQTT connection , HTTP Connection - I was able to manage things how ever Kafka is not working due to any reason . Please observe it.

Did you upgrade from a prior Ditto version?
It could be that the images are still the old ones .. I think the Docker ""latest"" is not automatically pulled unless you force to do so.

Did you down via ""docker-compose"" first before updating and did you explicitly ""pull""?

I think to remember that we explicitly added `CachingSignalEnrichmentFacade` extension point in Ditto to retrieve only selectively parts of ""things"" (based on their namespace ""search index configuration"") when processing - retrieving a ""partial thing"" in order to update the search index:
https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/022dffee0c1a21cedd57b74310683db5d7ce881e/internal/models/signalenrichment/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/internal/models/signalenrichment/DittoCachingSignalEnrichmentFacade.java#L113-L158

We would need a custom `JsonFieldSelector` configured per namespace name, defining which fields of a ""thing"" to retrieve (and cache) for updating the search index.
The configuration could look like:
* a list/map of namespaces
   * namespace
      * indexedFields as `JsonFieldSelector`

Example what I have in mind (to put in the `search.conf` as configuration of the mentioned extension point):
https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/022dffee0c1a21cedd57b74310683db5d7ce881e/thingsearch/service/src/main/resources/search.conf#L11

```
namespaces = [
  {
    namespace-name = ""org.eclipse.ditto.foo""
    indexed-fields = [ 
      ""thingId"", 
      ""policyId"", 
      ""_revision"", 
      ""_created"", 
      ""_modified"", 
      ""attributes/indexed-one""
      ""attributes/complex-jsonobj""
    ]
  }
]
```

I hope that helps a little. Maybe a Ditto committer still at Bosch can share more details how this can be done, based on the identified extension point.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85h3IBM/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I recently thought about this feature. We have a clear need to have aggregations of important thing states to manage a large fleet of devices. To have an overview of groups of devices we need to aggregate the connectivity or health or update state of the devices within a group efficiently. Current solution is to replicate the important states in a relational db and update the replica based on a Ditto Kafka connection. Aggregation is then done efficiently in the RDB (home turf for that). But not good to having need for two databases.

So if there is an easy way to use aggregation capabilities of the MongoDB this would be beneficial.

> aggregations should be possible based on the values of an attribute (e.g. ""groupId"")

You mean that eg the ""groupId"" would be used as ""group by"" in an aggregation?
But having another specified field? 

From your comment I assume that you would need a ""distinct count"" aggregation?
I can currently not imagine how to declare such a aggregation with the RQL syntax. 



For other queries and interpreting the sparse RQL documentation (and the lack of a specified count aggregation), I would assume that e.g. a ""count"" aggregation could look like:
```
GET /api/2/search/things?filter=aggregate(attributes/groupId,count())
```

With a response being e.g.:
```json
{
  ""items"": [
    {
      ""my-group-1"": 42
    },
    {
      ""my-group-2"": 7
    }
  ], 
... 
}
```

Another example to find out the mean temperature of a room with devices providing temperature readings:
```
GET /api/2/search/things?filter=aggregate(attributes/roomId,mean(features/temperature/properties/currentReading))
```

With a response being e.g.:
```json
{
  ""items"": [
    {
      ""kitchen"": 21.32
    },
    {
      ""living"": 22.03
    }
  ],
... 
}

Sorry for not being precise here. You're right, the use case is not only about aggregation but also about grouping. The full example in SQL would be:

> select room, connectivity, count(*)
> from thing
> group by room, connectivity


with a response being:

room | connectivity | count(*)
-- | -- | --
kitchen | online | 3
living | offline | 1
living | online | 4

So the interesting part is to get a statistic overview of your fleet.
May be using a SQL db for that purpose is a valid solution. But I know relational databases much better than RQL or MongoDB...

Translated to MongoDB this query could be (I did not verify yet):
```
db.search.aggregate([
    {$group : {_id:{""attributes/roomId"":""$t.attributes.roomId"", ""features/connectivity/properties/state"":""$t.features.connectivity.properties.state""}, ""count()"":{$count:{}}}},

for the UI error, please check if you provided the right user for the connections api:
<img width=""790"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201481110-8bfebe5d-20e0-4228-b641-ffc058fe8676.png"">

There is no tutorial for setting up your case with the UI. Here are the steps I tried:

1. Create the MQTT 5 with JS Mapping connection
2. Set the connection status to ""open"" and save the connection. Be sure the live connection status turns open: 
<img width=""961"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201482660-ca0a397b-b2c8-43c1-9306-d91f39762551.png"">

3. (optional) Enable connection logs on the connection: 
<img width=""956"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201482714-baa37034-ae27-4630-861d-4af5e1ba2201.png"">
 
4. Create an empty thing: 
<img width=""1430"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201482784-418a2ffe-3529-44f3-9d80-d1bee961453a.png"">

5. Adjust the policy of the thing and allow the MQTT connection to access it. Add a new entry ""MQTT"" to the policy and add the two authorization subjects of the connection to the entry: 
<img width=""1430"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201482952-71a68dee-89f6-41ed-9972-a9fe67bc8edc.png"">

6. On your MQTT client, create a sample ditto message in a file `message.json` (adapt the ID of your thing created in step 4):

```
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/7dab7c0f-67e5-423c-a859-ed7982699788/things/twin/commands/modify"",
  ""path"": ""/attributes/serialNumber"",
  ""value"": 123456789
}
```

8. Publish that message to the MQTT broker:
`mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -t eclipse-ditto-sandbox/7dab7c0f-67e5-423c-a859-ed7982699788/update -D publish content-type application/vnd.eclipse.ditto+json -f message.json`

9. Message is processed and the thing should have a new serial number attribute: 
<img width=""961"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201483649-eed03b7c-cbf9-4d2a-8be7-6833ac0d3ef1.png"">

<img width=""1431"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201483691-f95d3ca7-1edf-4cd8-9108-526929c3eb7c.png"">

Let me know if that works for you. Be sure to separate namespace and thingName in the message payload and topic names in the right way.
In the other example, the connection just uses the `nginx:ditto` authorization subject. So instead of changing the policy (step 5), you can also change the authorization subjects in the connection from `ditto:inbound-auth-subject` to `nginx:ditto` (same for `ditto:outbound-auth-subject`). The way described above is a bit more complicated but mimics a real scenario where you control independent access rights for the device and the application.

1. On your MQTT client, execute: `mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -t eclipse-ditto-sandbox/#`

2. Create a new feature for your thing: 
<img width=""1432"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201485274-e74a5cde-5486-489e-a63e-eec3af08eee5.png"">

3. Your MQTT client should receive a message:
```
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/7dab7c0f-67e5-423c-a859-ed7982699788/things/twin/events/created"",
  ""path"": ""/features/new-feature"",
  ""headers"": ...,
  ""value"": {}
}
```

4. Set a desired state of the new feature:

  ""headers"": ...,
  ""value"": {
    ""desiredProperties"": {
      ""mode"": ""DEBUG""
    }
  }
}
```

Instead of using a desired state, you can also just **send a command to the device**:

1. Add another topic `_/_/things/live/messages` to the target of the connection: 
<img width=""520"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201490341-f5bb22b9-f50c-46f2-8ed8-660eb904aa5e.png"">

 
2. On your new feature send a message with `timeout=0` (fire and forget): 
<img width=""1426"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20593339/201489553-afdd2644-57fc-4bea-866d-dba277be71c5.png"">

3. MQTT client receives this command as a live message:

What you want is (probably, you must know best) an Mqtt connection with a source and a Kafka connection with a target.

If you want to update the twins/things managed in Ditto via Mqtt messages, you can subscribe in the Kafka connection target to twin events and publish those to Kafka.
If you just want to convert Mqtt messages to Kafka messages there are probably easier solutions than to do that via Ditto connections.

Maybe I've missed something obvious, but in many scenarios its necessary to poll devices/gateways/services for data. 

Is there any build in way to achieve this? 
I would prefer not have to run my own service that polls http endpoints and sends the result to a message broker.

In order to do that, a ""Consumer"" for HTTP connection has to be created and started in `HttpPushClientActor` (currently, only a `HttpPublisherActor` is started there).
How to create and start the ""Consumer"" role can be looked at from the other connection types. It e.g. involves creating a new class extending the abstract `BaseConsumerActor` class.

Regarding the scheduling you asked in #1541: you can use Akka's scheduler to schedule repeating tasks (like the polling).
The polling interval should be configurable via the connection configuration (done in class `HttpPushSpecificConfig`).

The use of Akka's scheduler could look similar to (used in an Akka actor):
```java
Object message = ....;
Cancellable cancellable = getContext().getSystem().scheduler()
   .scheduleAtFixedRate(initialDelayFromConfig, intervalFromConfig, getSelf(),
        message, context.dispatcher(), ActorRef.noSender())
```

This will send the `message` each `intervalFromConfig` to `getSelf()` (the own actor) - this message should trigger the polling of the HTTP endpoint.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85PsIIQ/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@Abhijeetmishr not exactly .. it is about polling an HTTP endpoint at a configured location, HTTP verb and path ..
I would suggest to create a new connection type ""http-poll"" for that which only supports ""sources"" - that requires quite a bit of understanding of the Ditto connectivity service.

I cannot explain better than in the extensive documentation does.

The same as for all connection types, however http-push currently only supports connection targets (also see documentation for difference between sources and targets).

So you would e.g. define:
* each 30 minutes, poll an HTTP endpoint via GET
   * but what if the HTTP endpoint already includes a ""device id"" or a ""thing id""? where does that come from?

For other connection sources which are always reacting on an ""outside"" message, there are several ways to get a thingId:
* as part of protocol headers
* as part of e.g. protocol topic (e.g. for MQTT, Kafka)
* as part of the received payload

When a source now is triggered by a cron-job/polling, those information sources do not exist, so where do they come from? Ideas:
* one connection per thingId to poll for
   * does not scale very well - only usable for ""small use cases""
* static configuration in the connection of a list of thing IDs
   * not very dynamic :/
* result of an internal search query, determining thingIds ... (e.g. searching for all devices of type ""gateway"" in Ditto, e.g. identified by an attribute)
   * could internally done via ""streaming"" the found thingIds in order to not need paging 
* call of another HTTP API returning the list of ids first (this could also be Ditto's own search API endpoint maybe?)
   * but what about paging? 

I think I tend into determining the list of thingIds to poll an HTTP API for via either static configuration of a list or by using an internal search.

As long as this is one Ditto cluster, you can scale out every single Ditto service (eg Ditto-things to as many instances as you require for handling your load).

Configuring several separate Ditto clusters to use the same MongoDB instance using the same collections is a really bad idea, the underlying event sourcing mechanism which Ditto makes use of will cause corrupt DB entries if eg the same Thing is updated by multiple Ditto installations.

Because of this, a blue/green update of Ditto is also not advisable.

Hi, I'm also wondering about how to deploy a ditto cluster on several servers (via kubernetes). Ditto is the core component of my system, so I'm trying to prevent SPOF(single point of failure). I think I should deploy a ditto cluster on several servers (via kubernetes)? Or any other advice on how to achieve this goal?

I've read the document files but I didn't find a tutorial about scaling out ditto service/deploying ditto on several computers (to become a whole cluster). Am I lacking something important?

Could you provide more context on the use case? What you mentioned above is a one-to-many mapping.

In general the model that Ditto encourages is that a Device(be it a Gateway or not) to send a message and update the corresponding digital twin. So each twin is a separate entity representing a real world **thing**.

In theory what you want is possible, but you would have to remove the **enforcement** for the specific **Source** from which you are consuming the messages > [Info on source enforcement](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-connections.html#source-enforcement)

If you have removed the **enforcement** there's nothing stopping you from sending the multiple messages that you want, but please be aware that the **authorizationContext** used for the **Source** would be evaluated against each Policy of the Things you are attempting to update.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85RuLf4/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

**My question aims toward these points: -**
1. Establish connectivity between Eclipse Ditto and Graph DB- modifying the Spring JPA in Ditto source code to work with Neo4J?
2. Any tight coupling existing in the spring data JPA?
3. Updates required to change the data pointers from Mongo DB to any other DB

As of now- we are using MongoDB service as backing datastore of Ditto (and also to get ditto running).
Is it possible to substitute MongoDB with a GraphDB - to store and query the data?

1. Eclipse Ditto does not make use of Spring or Spring JPA - so there is nothing to modify on that level
2. Same as 1. - there is no Spring Data JPA used .. Ditto makes use of [Akka Persistence](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence.html) for DB abstraction - as far as I know there is no persistence plugin for neo4j
3. 
   a.) Utilizing the ""Akka Persistence"" abstraction, switching to another DB should be possible, see the list of [supported plugins](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence-plugins.html)
   b.) However the Ditto ""search"" functionality is purely based on MongoDB with no abstraction concept in place - that would require a rewrite to another DB

So substituting MongoDB with another DB could be possible for parts of Ditto (e.g. persistence of things, policies, connections) - but still with quite a few development efforts to replace the custom [MongoReadJournal](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/master/internal/utils/persistence/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/internal/utils/persistence/mongo/streaming/MongoReadJournal.java) implementation provided by Ditto.

No applicable authentication provider was found!

I have `ENABLE_PRE_AUTHENTICATION` set to true. Am I correct in assuming that I don't need to add Keycloak details in 
`-Dditto.gateway.authentication.oauth.openid-connect-issuers.myprovider.issuer` if I'm using this setup?

One thing pending is I haven't set the header `x-ditto-pre-authenticated`. I'm not sure how to create `<issuer>:<subject>` combination in Nginx Ingress annotations. I do have `x-auth-request-user` header getting forwarded from the Ingress though.

That exactly is the problem - Ditto will only look in the `x-ditto-pre-authenticated` header for the ""pre authenticated"" method.

Yes, that will work.

No, as only the ""subject"" would be passed via the `x-ditto-pre-authenticated` header and not the complete JWT.

If you need to configure JWT placeholders, you will have to configure the OpenID connect provider in Ditto and not use the OpenID connect proxy (which completely hides the JWT from Ditto).

Does Ditto explicitly not look for JWT scopes if pre-authentication is enabled or is it just because the JWT token isn't available?
I'm asking because I can configure [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) to pass the access token back upstream to Ditto as I've done below with the config options:
```
        - --set-xauthrequest
        - --pass-access-token
```

```
    ""x-auth-request-user"": ""devin"",
    ""x-ditto-pre-authenticated"": ""keycloak:devin"",
    ""x-auth-request-email"": ""test@gmail.com"",
    ""x-auth-request-groups"": ""/moderators,/superadmins"",

    ""host"": ""example.com"",
    ""x-request-id"": ""678ad1e3addd56500df255d84cd89306"",
```

I've tested the token, it is valid and contains all the scopes. I do need to change the header name to `Authorization` and add `Bearer` prefix, but the token can be made available to Ditto Gateway. Do you think Ditto will accept it with pre-authentication enabled, to be used in placeholders?

Exactly, once `pre-authentication` is enabled and the `x-ditto-pre-authenticated` is set, the `Authorization` header will not be looked at (to e.g. extract the JWT from).
FMPOV this would not make sense, as the JWT'S signature has to be validated against the public key of the OAuth2 provider anyhow in order to be able to ""trust"" its claims.
I don't see a benefit why you would like to combine oauth2-proxy and pre-authentication with Ditto's built in OpenID connect support.

Or do you not have an OpenIdConnect supporting OAuth2 provider and still want to support it (that could be a reason)?
If that would be the case, maybe it would be possible to also support non-OpenIdConnect supporting OAuth2 providers (if the endpoints are e.g. statically configured where to get the provider's public key, etc.).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85TuvHB/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

My whole point of using oauth2-proxy was that the gateway apis can be called from browser also. From browser, its difficult to send Authorization header, but easier to send a session cookie. Oauth2-proxy and Nginx ingress allow cookie-based sessions and authentication redirection.
Also mentioned in Ditto documentation:

I was confused, thinking that since I'm already authenticating using the proxy, I should be using pre-authentication mode.

Now, I'm using OpenID Connect configuration in Ditto (not using pre-authentication mode) and have configured the proxy to set Authorization header, which is then used by Ditto to extract the JWT data.

Ah, I see .. that notice in the docs is really a bit confusing.

Did you use nginx to do that?
That configuration might be a helpful addition to the configuration or the documentation of Ditto of how to do that with ""simple means"" as an nginx proxy.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85Tzzqi/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Ditto **currently does not directly provide an API for devices to interact with**. 
That was envisioned to be encapsulated via a separate ""Device Connectivity Layer"" (like an MQTT broker or an Eclipse Hono or a Apache Kafka).
That way, a managed Ditto ""connection"" would be responsible for connecting to this extra device connectivity layer and translating from/to the specific protocol (e.g. MQTT, AMQP, Kafka).

This has the **downside** that a (productive) setup with Ditto always requires an **additional broker or infrastructure for connecting devices**.  

## CoAP

CoAP, as an equivalent to HTTP for constrained devices, could be a perfect addition to Ditto in order to enable an IoT backend without the need for an additional broker.
As a CoAP API can be implemented basically the same as an HTTP API, Ditto's `gateway` service (currently responsible for providing the HTTP API, the WebSocket API and the SSE API) would be the perfect location for additionally providing CoAP endpoints.

Devices could then, using CoAP, directly interact with their ""twins"" (things), e.g. retrieving a property, updating a property, or even retrieving the ""desired"" state, etc.

## CoAP Endpoints

The most straight forward way of defining the CoAP endpoints to support is to basically support all of the existing ""/api/2/things"" HTTP endpoints also as CoAP endpoints:
* Things: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Things
* Features: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/http-api-doc.html#/Features

## Authentication

CoAP supports different authentication mechanisms, as far as I know:
* PSK (pre shared keys) based
* Client Certificate based

I currently do not have more knowledge - I assume that Ditto could configure a Certificate Authority (CA) for e.g. authenticating client certificates. Or that PSKs could be configured as well via configuration or a file mount.

Feedback on that would be appreciated :)

## Authorization

Once a device via CoAP was authenticated (see above), a ""subjectId"" would be determined from the authenticated device, e.g.:
```
coap-psk:<the-authenticated-device-id>
```
Using this subject in a Ditto Policy, a device can get authorized to e.g. read/write its twin data or to send/receive messages.

Example policy:
```json
{
  ""policyId"": ""namespace:the-policy"",
  ""entries"": {

## Implementation

The implementation would rely on our sister project, [Eclipse Californium](https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium).
I see 2 options how to do the implemtation:
* either implementing a CoAP to HTTP proxy (fully supporting all existing HTTP APIs)
   * an example can be found in Californium: https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/tree/main/californium-proxy2
   * downside: an additional ""hop"" (but only from ""localhost"" to ""localhost"", so should not be that bad)
   * upside: if mapped once correctly (e.g. ""PATCH"", ""GET"", ""UPDATE"", ""DELETE"" and also server sent events), all available HTTP APIs should automatically work via CoAP as well
* or re-implementing the existing HTTP endpoints via californium, all explicitly
   * downside: much effort, could divert from the HTTP API
   * upside: no additional HTTP request required
* maybe there is a third option which could have the benefits from both variants above - without the need to do another (internal) HTTP call 
   * that has to be investigated

## Testing

Is there an equivalent to e.g. `cURL` (or `httpie` / Postman / etc.) for doing CoAP requests to test during development?
For unit testing I assume that we also can use Californium as the client?

## Deployment

I also have no idea what CoAP (UDP) endpoints means to a (cloud) deployment, e.g. regarding loadbalancers.

Maybe someone has more input on that, what to consider, etc.?


# Please provide feedback / input

To anyone who is interested in this topic, directly providing CoAP endpoints in Ditto, please comment and provide feedback.

May I invite @boaks, the project lead of Eclipse Californium and **the** CoAP expert, to join the discussion? :)

Let's start:

Authentication:

Californium itself uses ""callbacks"" to fetch the credentials. The callbacks may be used in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. Californium comes also with some demo-implementations. I don't know, how ditto keeps/manages the credentials, but maybe it's possible to implement the Californium interfaces using the current ditto credentials implementation.

**PSK**: 
similar to ""username/password"", but the password is not exchanged and must be available on both sides (server and client) in clear. 

[AdvancedPskStore](https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/blob/main/scandium-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/scandium/dtls/pskstore/AdvancedPskStore.java)

**certificate based**: 
Californium supports x509 and RFC7250 (Raw public key).

To authenticate Californium uses [CertificateProvider](https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/blob/main/scandium-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/scandium/dtls/x509/CertificateProvider.java)

To verify the authentication of the other peer [NewAdvancedCertificateVerifier](https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/blob/main/scandium-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/scandium/dtls/x509/NewAdvancedCertificateVerifier.java) 

(Just to mention: the curios names are the result of a development over several periods. Maybe with Californium 4.0 we polish the names. It will then be some ""typing work"", but I guess it would make it easier afterwards. For now, no schedule for 4.0 exists).

All the interfaces are in java packages and comes there with demonstration implementations. Though I consider it valuable to use Californium on its own, I added a [MultiPskFileStore](https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/blob/main/scandium-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/scandium/dtls/pskstore/MultiPskFileStore.java)  and I will see, what I can provide in the future. Anyway, for upstream projects it's mostly preferable to implement these interfaces using the own infrastructure.

Yes, that would be my next step .. :)

Regarding

Ditto currently does not keep/manage credentials - for HTTP it relies on OpenId Connect providers to authenticate (and then ""just"" uses the JWT issued by those providers to apply authorization).
Or it relies on a reverse proxy (e.g. a ""nginx"") to manage credentials.

I would probably want to avoid adding a separate persistence for credentials and  go into the direction of providing them also as kind of a "".htpasswd"" file format (like ""nginx"" also does) which can be provided via volume mount.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85V6u3q/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes.

I think I will manage, thanks. 👍

Do you from the top of head know what a server has to respond when a client sends an ""observe cancel""?

I came here as this issue looks like a replacement or an alternative of Hono CoAP adapter.
In general it will be convenient to have direct device endpoint without broker in Ditto.
Looking what the connectivity service gives somehow following two functionalities are missing when the gateway service is used:
- Payload mapping functionality. Constrained devices usually use binary payloads and does not have enough memory to create full plaintext Ditto JSON payload. 
- How the device will receive twin events or live messages.

The issue title is already noting that those points are out of the scope.
Anyway, have you thought about that?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85aL92_/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I wouldn't say that it is a replacement for Hono's CoAP adapter.
Hono is payload agnostic and does not provide entities which could be interacted with using CoAP.
Ditto however has those, and can offer direct APIs for devices supporting CoAP.

It can really be seen as an equal alternative to Ditto's Http Api, but with focus for devices instead of eg Web or Mobile Applications.

I would therefore not see that the payload mapping and other connectivity features of Ditto is required.
The devices must not even speak Ditto Protocol with the proposed CoAP APIs, but can make use of partial request and partial updates, eg. only updating a scalar property value.

Devices can also receive events and even messages, using CoAP `observe` which provides equal functionality as the SSE API of Ditto Http.

However, I am no longer working on this functionality, as my employer is not interested in CoAP.

I suggest to provide a new UI functionality to configure the log levels, in a new ""Admin"" menu item.
The credentials are the same as for managing connections, so authentication is already handled by the UI.

PKCE looks very promising but it needs some infrastructure (Authorization Server and OAuth2 Proxy for ditto?) and I think it will be easier to test if this is available in the cloud. I started with Google as an authorization server and tried out the Google authentication to the sandbox HTTP API.
- My Google Oauth ClientID and Secret did not work, because I do not know the redirect URL for the ditto sandbox server. Is there a more detailed description, how this use of sandbox HTTP API with Google should work? May be a good start would be to use the same approach for the UI as for the Swagger UI. But for that I would need to being able to test it
- Do I understand right, that there is an OAuth2 proxy on the Ditto sandbox installed? If needed, can we extend that with PKCE flow? It would be nice to have Google SSO directly with the sandbox and the UI 😉.

The old values are not deleted, which often is needed and expected.

It would however be a good enhancement if there would be an option to define that for a certain json object the existing content should be completely replaced with the new object.

Example:
Given thing:
```json
{
... 
  ""features"": {
    ""Foo"": {
       ""properties"": {
          ""map"": {
            ""a"": 1,
            ""b"": 2,
            ""c"": 3
          }
       } 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

Expected thing after merge:
```json
{ 
... 
  ""features"": {
    ""Foo"": {
       ""properties"": {
          ""map"": {
            ""x"": 42,
            ""y"": false,
            ""z"": 23
          }
       } 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

Currently, this would not be possible to do with a single merge command.
E.g if the following merge command is issued:
```json
{
  ""topic"" : "".../merge"",
  ""path"": ""/features"" 
  ""value"": {
    ""Foo"": {
       ""properties"": {
          ""map"": {
            ""x"": 42,
            ""y"": false,
            ""z"": 23
          }
       } 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

The resulting new Thing after applying the merge patch would be:
 ```json
{
... 
  ""features"": {
    ""Foo"": {
       ""properties"": {
          ""map"": {
            ""a"": 1,
            ""b"": 2,
            ""c"": 3, 
            ""x"": 42,
            ""y"": false,
            ""z"": 23
          }
       } 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

I propose an enhancement to the implemented ""merge-patch"" semantics to let the sender of the command clear specific objects before applying the changes.

I would suggest to use a syntax `""{{ /.*/ }}"": null` (as `null` deletes elements in json merge patch) to declare to delete all sub elements of a json object before applying the new provided elements.

Example:
```json
{
  ""topic"" : "".../merge"",
  ""path"": ""/features"" 
  ""value"": {
    ""Foo"": {
       ""properties"": {
          ""map"": {
            ""{{ /.*/ }}"": null, 
            ""x"": 42,
            ""y"": false,
            ""z"": 23
          }
       } 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

Using a very specific, eg. with curly braces, syntax would prevent the problem that a certain reserved character cannot be used as key.

Syntax proposal:
```
""{{ /.*/ }}"": null
""{{ /2023-04-.?.?/ }}"": null
```


An example where regex use makes sense is eg to remove all fields starting with a 4 digital year, followed by a `-` and arbitrary additional characters:
```
""{{ /[0-9]{4}-.*/ }}"": null
```

Only `null` values (deleting existing keys) shall be supported to not allow totally crazy stuff to be done with that.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1593/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I'm trying to setup Kafka connection with target using following topic filter: `_/_/things/twin/events?extraFields=features/{{feature:id}}&filter=like(resource:path,'/features/RemoteAccessConnections*')`.

But no changes of desired properties are propagated to Kafka (e.g. by `PUT /api/2/things/test:device/features/RemoteAccessConnections/desiredProperties`). 

I did some debugging and came to conclusion that problem is in class [ThingEventToThingConverter](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/master/things/model/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/things/model/signals/events/ThingEventToThingConverter.java#L111) because there is no mapping for FeatureDesiredPropertiesModified (an other) event defined and as a consequence signal filtering fails in this [method](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/master/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/persistence/SignalFilter.java#L178) for such events.

Am I doing something wrong or is it intended behavior? In this [article ](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2020-11-11-desired-properties.html) it is explicitly said that enrichment and filtering should be supported also for desired properties so I would consider it as a bug.

They convert incoming payload to a Ditto Protocol message without the ability to look additional information up.  
One of the reasons for that is sandboxing, so that e.g. a payload mapper e.g. does not do heavy ""external lookups"".

A great addition however would be if payload mappers could look up information (Ditto internally) from the ""thing"" they want to update, e.g. retrieving the ""thing definition"" or some kind of ""type"" attribute to execute different payload mapper code for different types of things.

That would require that a Payload Mapper can retrieve a thing (or its static information like ""definition"" and ""attributes"" - we could make that configurable what should be able to be retrieved in payload mappers as ""thing context"" information) before applying the actual payload mapping.

Details:
* define somehow how to extract the `thingId` to retrieve information from (e.g. via placeholders .. e.g. from the MQTT or Kafka topic or via a header, optionally applying a function)
   * as part of the ""Connection"" mapper config
* configure in Ditto ""connectivity"" service config which fields should be able to retrieve at all (default: thingId,definition,attributes) 
* configure in the payload mapper options what to retrieve, e.g. as `fields` selector like e.g.: `fields=definition,attributes`
* inject the ""thingStaticContext"" as optional parameter to payload mappers
* also enhance the JavaScript payload mapper with that option
* think about caching - if we only retrieve static information (like ""definition"", ""attributes""), this information should not change too often
* it should also be possible to do a ""search"" via attributes, as alternative to already ""know"" the `thingId` based from headers or topic
   * first match is returned, e.g.: with fields: `thingId,definition,attributes`

issue,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1609,https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1609,ditto,1650369771,1609,"Resolve ""external values"" in Things via search and connections",thjaeckle,1331526,Thomas Jaeckle,thomas.jaeckle@beyonnex.io,OPEN,2023-04-01T08:49:08Z,2023-04-07T10:10:02Z,"The idea of this issue is to have a special kind of JSON values inside a Ditto Thing (e.g. as `attribute` or as `feature` `property`) which are not directly available in Ditto's _twin_ persistence, but which are resolved by Ditto from an ""external source"" (like another API, e.g. an HTTP endpoint, or a Kafka topic).

Such an ""external value"" would have a special json format in the Thing.

Some ideas of **what** could be ""externally resolved"":
- perform Ditto **searches**
   - e.g. for relationships: all ""Devices"" belonging to a ""Room"" (also managed in Ditto) refer to the room's `thingId` in an attribute `attributes/roomThingId` - the Room however is not directly aware of its devices (as this would be a bidirectional relationship and therefore e.g. difficult to update consistently)
      - the ""Room"" Thing could simply have an ""externally resolved"" attribute with a Ditto search query like e.g. `filter=eq(attributes/roomThingId,{{ thing:id }}),fields=thingId`
      - placeholders could be used in order to e.g. use the room's data dynamically (see above)
      - a `fields` selector could be used in order to define certain fields of the search results to resolve as the ""external value""
- perform Ditto **aggregations**, e.g. calculating the average temperature of room
   - currently, Ditto's search cannot yet perform aggregations - that's however an idea to do in #1525 
   - again, in the ""Room"" example, the room could define an ""external value"" resolving the room's current average temperature which is resolved via a search aggregation over all devices of that room reporting a temperature
- **invoke foreign APIs**, resolving external values
   - a ""Digital Twin"" is often used to also orchestrate other APIs, e.g. providing a lower level API for the device data managed by another system (like e.g. a LoRa Server or a mobile network provider)
   - to have a ""single point of truth"", data from other APIs often want to also be mirrored to the twin (and e.g. automatically updated as well)

Some ideas of **when** ""external values"" are resolved:
- **on access**: whenever an ""external value"" is retrieved via Ditto, it could first be resolved ""from externally""
   - this strategy could also define a caching strategy of how often to do the external lookup (which can potentially be costly to look up or has a big latency)
   - this would block the retrieve until the value was retrieved externally 
- **scheduled**: define eg cron syntax when an external value should be resolved

Some ideas of **what to do** with resolved ""external values"":
- the twin could be updated with the external value
   - to also be findable via Ditto search for example
   - or as part of a caching strategy
   - or to have the value available in the Thing's history API
- the resolved value could just be returned back, without persisting/caching it
   - to e.g. always externally resolve the value
   - if the result is very large, it maybe is not wanted to persist it in the twin

To get an idea how this could look like, this is a first rough idea of the format:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""foo:my-room-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""foo:my-room-policy-1"",
  ""attributes"": {
    ""roomDevices"": {
      ""_ditto-external-value-config"": { // TODO define a good ""reserved keyword""
        ""source"": ""connection:<the-connection-id>/<the-target-address>"",
        ""updateStrategy"": {
          ""type"": ""cron"",
          ""config"": ""<the cron config>""
        },
        ""responseStrategy"": ""updateTwin"" // ""updateTwin"" | ""dispatchOnly""
      }
      ""value"": ... // this is the Json Value where the retrieved external Json value (e.g. Json array or object or string) is stored
    } 
  }
}
```

And here an example for an internal Ditto search:
```json
{
  ""thingId"": ""foo:my-room-1"",
  ""policyId"": ""foo:my-room-policy-1"",
  ""attributes"": {
    ""roomDevices"": {
      ""_ditto-external-value-config"": { // TODO define a good ""reserved keyword""
        ""source"": ""search?filter=eq(attributes/roomThingId,{{ thing:id }}),fields=thingId"",
        ""updateStrategy"": {
          ""type"": ""onAccess"", // would update the value when e.g. `/attributes/roomDevices/value` is retrieved
          ""config"": ""always"" // also retrieve, when complete thing or all attributes are retrieved, alternative could be ""exact""
        },
        ""responseStrategy"": ""updateTwin"" // ""updateTwin"" | ""dispatchOnly""
      }
      ""value"": [
        {""thingId"": ""foo:my-device-1""},
        {""thingId"": ""foo:my-device-2""}
      ]
    } 
  }
}
```

To clarify:
* could the ""ditto-external-value-config"" also be a metadata (not even shown in the Thing JSON by default)?
   * that way, the ""end user"" of the thing would not even be aware of the ""external value"" and just use the twin's data like any other data, which would be great
   * the json structure would not have to follow a certain structure, but could be completely defined by the user
   * the stuff inside the ""ditto-external-value-config"" would not be indexed in the twin's values in search and would not be part of the full thing json 
   * downside: metadata does not yet provide concepts for access control, see #1403 
      * so every subject with write permission would be able to define/change the external value mapping
* the Ditto ""things"" service does not know of ""connectivity"" or ""search"" service .. how to solve where to address such a ""external value"" lookup message to?
   * maybe the configuration of things could define some templates (eg for search and connections) - configuring messages to send via pub/sub and the  topic to use for publishing 

The ""scheduled"" variant could also supersede issue #1542 - the existing ""HTTP-push"" connection type would be sufficient to also solve what #1542 was aiming for - the cron/schedule would be defined in the things which would want to poll data.
And great benefit would be that this then works for all connection types, not only http.

However for doing a simple conversion of a Json payload with the available options is not really simple.

Ditto also introduced parsing a JWT with a new placeholder for that:
https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-placeholders.html#jwt-placeholder
That placeholder is basically already a simple Json parser.

The idea of this issue now is a new payload mapper in which a Json template is configured to eg parse an external Json and convert to a Ditto Protocol json. And vice versa.

Example configuration template:
```json
{
  ""topic"": ""{{ header:thing-id | fn:replace(':','/') }}/things/twin/commands/merge"", 
  ""path"": ""/features"", 
  ""value"": {
    ""temperature"": {

Using the built in placeholder functions would also be possible.

You are doing a lot of things already correctly.
One missing piece is to use the configured Javascript payload mapper in the ""source"" of your connection:
Look at the schema of connections here: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/basic-connections.html#connection-model

The ""sources"" array contains a list of `Source` in which a `payloadMapping` array is defined.
This contains names of the payload mappers defined within your connection in `mappingDefinitions` (to enable reuse).
Your mapping definitions name is `javascript` (the UI uses that as default name).

So your source is missing:

Yes, of course - the UI just helps on the formatting (e.g. replacing linebreaks with `\n` in the inlined javascript of the connection).

I am creating a connection and using a custom JS mapper. I want to use the ""Create or modify a Thing"" command as there are a lot of devices that I want to be dynamically created if they don't exist. This seems to work fine but the PolicyID on creation is being set to the ThingID and the connection does not have permission to create new policies. In this scenario is there a way to set the Policy in the JS mapper? Apologies if this is covered in the documentation but I can't find it. 

I did try using the ImplicitThingCreation mapper as it mentioned setting policies but the headers I receive have minimal information and the ThingID is stored in the request payload which I can't figure out a way of accessing without using a JS mapper. I also tried combining a JS and ImplicitThingCreation mapper to extract the ID into the header but had no luck with this.

The `responseDispatchedMonitor` is used - however this method is also called for ""target only"" connections for outbound signals.  
Those are not a response (reported as the `""address"": ""_responses""`), but should be reported to the `getMonitorsForOutboundSignal()`:

https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/a5862aad7decb8b9ea4187010af6a1b6d26b1430/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/OutboundMappingProcessorActor.java#L679

It even seems that the metrics for e.g. the `""Message is dropped as a result of backpressure strategy!""` situation are counted and logged twice for the `dispatched` type:
* once as a `success` (with correct `target` address)
* once as a `failed` (with the wrong `""_responses""` address)

That must also be analyzed, it should per category only be counted once.

Check the provided target logs and search for the correlationId `6c73e2e6-defa-42fd-a7c4-53a3d8f6e2de` in order to reproduce:

E.g. think about you want to change the behavior of all devices attached to e.g. a ""room"" or located inside a specific ""building"". This link could be simply added as an attribute of the device, e.g. `""roomId""` or `""buildingId""`.  
In order to retrieve / `GET` the state of all devices of a room, an API does already exist in Ditto, the search:  
```
GET /api/2/search/things?filter=eq(attributes/roomId,""0815"")
```

This issue is about adding a new API (both on HTTP and on DittoProtocol level) in order to do something similar for also modifications (via HTTP `PUT` / `PATCH`) or sending messages (via HTTP `POST`) - while providing a `filter` (RQL condition) which things should be selected/targeted for the operation.

The first idea which comes to my head is something like:
```
PATCH /api/2/mass/things?filter=eq(attributes/roomId,""0815"")

PUT /api/2/mass/things/features/thermostat/properties/temperature?filter=eq(attributes/roomId,""0815"")

POST /api/2/mass/things/features/thermostat/inbox/messages/toggle?filter=eq(attributes/roomId,""0815"")
```

Another use case which would be solved by such a functionality:

Sometimes the ID of a `thing` might not be available when trying to modify it.
For example because the only information available is e.g. a ""serialNumber"" - but this serialNumber is not necessarily a part of the `thingId`.

When such a thing should be updated, the `thingId` would first have to be looked up in Ditto.  
The process would then look like:
* process device message containing a serialNumber `my-serial-number`
* query Ditto's search with a filter querying for that serial number, e.g. with: `GET /api/2/search/things?filter=eq(attributes/serial,""my-serial-number"")&fields=thingId`
* if there is a result
   * use the returned `thingId` to build the ""modify or merge command"" to Ditto
   * send command
* if there is no result
   * handle exception case

At the Ditto HTTP API this could e.g. look like (in order to modify attributes):
`PUT /api/2/mass/things/attributes?filter=eq(attributes/serial,""my-serial-number"")&max-targets=1`

There should be an option like `max-targets` to define a limit of how many things should match the `filter`. The request would fail if more than this `max-targets` were chosen to apply the change on.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1622/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It could also be seen as ""mass operation API"", utilizing the search as source of thingIds to apply an operation to.
The available operations would be all available things api functionality, e.g.:
* modifying thing, feautre, attribute, etc
* merging..
* sending messages to things or features
* deleting things, features, attributes,...

The initially described use case would be possible to solve, but also so much more.
E.g think about sending a ""switch off"" message to all devices referencing the same room id.

I'm following the tour: https://www.eclipse.org/packages/packages/cloud2edge/tour/ and my aim is to create a new tenant, create some devices, send data to Hono and manipulate Ditto. Everything works fine except that Ditto does not receive any data.

I also noticed that the site has instructions to create a new connection between Hono and Ditto using AMQP but... the example that is also deployed uses Kafka. The example uses the domain ""org.eclipse.packages.c2e"".

If I had devices to the ""org.eclipse.packages.c2e"" domain everything works fine.

My curls are the following:
- Tenant
``
curl -i -X POST http://${REGISTRY_IP}:${REGISTRY_PORT_HTTP}/v1/tenants/skynet

- New device

Like I said, if I use the tenant from the example ""org.eclipse.packages.c2e"", it works fine but now when I create a new tenant.

I think this a related issue:
- https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1574

Also, I think it should be great to update the ""tour"" site in order to have instructions to connect Hono and Ditto using Kafka.

Does anyone have a working new kafka connection running with a new tenant?

Please advise.

Thanks

im using python script to send data via MQTT to update the my.test:octopus device 

```
>python send_mqtt_data_test.py
ditto-tutorial/my.test:octopus b'{""temp"": ""17.77"", ""alt"": ""344.21"", ""thingId"": ""my.test:octopus""}'
recieved
ditto-tutorial/my.test:octopus b'{""temp"": ""19.73"", ""alt"": ""349.06"", ""thingId"": ""my.test:octopus""}'
recieved
ditto-tutorial/my.test:octopus b'{""temp"": ""19.0"", ""alt"": ""317.99"", ""thingId"": ""my.test:octopus""}'
```


I can see on the UI that ditto is updating the my.test:octopus when ever it recieves mqtt messages show above


i am running a seperate python script that is subscribing to the following topics

```
topic0 = ""my.test:octopus/#""
topic1 = ""ditto-tutorial/#""
topic2 = ""my/last/will/topic""
topic3 = ""_/_/things/live/messages/#""
topic4 = ""test/ditto/data""
```

it recieves topic1 only,  this is just to make sure the subscribe is working  


note for topic ""test/ditto/data"" i added 
```
 ""headerMapping"": {
        ""mqtt.topic"": ""test/ditto/data"",
        ""mqtt.qos"": 0
      }
```
to the ""replyTarget"" and ""targets"" tags and both on the templet above but that didnt work so i removed it. 

then i went back to the same templet above and caputred the logs 
below shows the logs of the ""eclipse/ditto-connectivity:lates""

*Edit*: However, be very careful if you use the same addresses you already have in your config - as your source consumes from MQTT address `""ditto-tutorial/#""` and you publish to `""address"": ""ditto-tutorial/{{ thing:id }}""`, the source will consume MQTT messages from your target which could cause a loop.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85azGYD/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

opening  a second connection as a target worked for me 

the scenario we need is,  devices are sending data to ditto via MQTT with topic ""ditto-tutorial/{{ thing:id }}"" using ""mqtt Broker1"". When ditto recieves  data from the device, it send out the data to a seperate MQTT broker ""MQTT Broker2"" with a topic for example ""ditto/data/live/{{ thing:id }}"" and there is a master device that subscribes from MQTT Broker2 with topic ""ditto/data/+""

For now we just want to get it working on one broker.

if anyone interested this is the second connection templet that worked for me

Thanks for reporting this issue.

There were some enhancements to metadata in Ditto 3.0, I assume some behavior may have changed.

Could you please try using no trailing slash in the ""key"", so:
```
{
        ""key"":""unit"",
        ""value"": ""°C""
    }

Or think about use cases where devices are only rented. A condition shall enable the one who manages the rental devices to have special permissions when the device is currently not rented by a user.

It seems that maybe the ""policy enforcement"" for those things gets stuck.

I do not yet have a reproducer - just wanted to create the bug-ticket so that we can investigate and do not forget.

It seems related with a very high number of tasks (> 70k) done with the ""akka.actor.default-dispatcher"" for things instances. This number at a certain point for a single instance does not go down and probably not any other work on the ""default-dispatcher"" can be done as a result.
Which will de-facto cause the service to be ""dead in the water"".

It also seems like the affected node is the ""role cluster leader"" - got this message after deleting a ""dead in the water"" pod:
```
Singleton terminated, hand-over done [akka://ditto-cluster@10.20.67.2:2551 -> Some(akka://ditto-cluster@10.20.76.58:2551)]
```

Seems to be confirmed after the next leader also gets the same problems:
```
Cluster Node [akka://ditto-cluster@10.20.67.244:2551] - is the new leader among reachable nodes (more leaders may exist)
```

Somehow the cluster leader seems to require a lot of CPU resources, negatively impacting roundtrip times and causing other timeouts to ""fail"".  
The question if this can have to do with deleting and re-creating the same things is not yet answered - it was just an assumption.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1643/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

but if we want to use alternative format:
`<BASE_URL>/api/2/things/<thingid>?fields=attributes/manufacturer&fields=attributes/type&fields=attributes/productkey`


it only returns first attribute (in this case attributes/manufacturer).

While this may seem like minor issue, some libraries (jawax.ws.rs.QueryParam in JAX-RS API) use only the alternative format to serialize their requests, which makes it a bit harder to bypass.

Because I would assume that some dropping of traced requests is done before the tracing would slow down the functionality of the service or would overwhelm the OTEL endpoint.
The used logback logstash appender also does that. Under heavy load, not all log statements might be available.

Maybe this is even configurable in Kamon, the library Ditto uses for tracing.

We are trying to experiment by developing a simple performance-related digital twin for a biosensor using eclipse ditto and ditto-examples/grove-ctl. 

Therefore, we started by setting up a platform with a PC running Linux and connect this to a Raspberry equipped with grove light sensor (via GrovePi shield), following the steps in: https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto-examples/tree/master/grove-ctrl

Everything goes well with adding the raspberry sensor ""thing"" to ditto on the PC.
Also, we can also perform PUT/GET (http) operations on the thing:
a) curl -u ditto:ditto -X PUT   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '99'
'http://192.168.0.101:8080/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto.example:pi/features/IlluminanceSensor_0/properties/sensorValue'
to directly change property sensor values, and
b) curl -u ditto:ditto -X GET 'http://192.168.0.101:8080/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto.example:pi/features/IlluminanceSensor_0/properties/sensorValue' to view the new data.

However, we fail to connect from Raspberry to the thing via the websocket interface (by running: python 3 ditto_grove_demo.py, which uses ws/1 interface), with the following error recorded from ditto:
Error 403 -- ... the requester had insufficient permissions to modify it (WRITE is required)

Perhaps, we don't quite understand how to set up the WebUI connected to Ditto. Although, we compiled the webapp fine (using npm install, updating the http download sites),when we open webapp/index.html from ditto-master/deployment/docker directory, there are no updates at all (automatically or manually). 

Unfortunately, the instructions are missing in https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto-examples/tree/master/grove-ctrl
This url states (few lines above the Section ""Setting up the Raspberry Pi""): 
""After creating our Thing, we can commence by opening the WebUI for the first time. @Todo: Philipp"" (maybe this refers to Philipp Michalski)

Can you please help? 

Thank you in advance.

Dear Thomas,

Thank you for the quick response.

I understand the situtation

Since http interface works fine, we plan to develop over it and skip 
websockets for the time being.

Perhaps, once done, we can help update this part, which may be 
interesting for those working on edge computing or below.

By the way, do you think that ditto is able to operate in an industrial 
environment with lots of sensors?
Do you know of any study related to it?

We appreciate your help.

Best regards,

Miltos

Due to a node crash on my Kubernetes cluster, some pods from Ditto were restarted. These included the NGINX proxy, Ditto Gateway and Ditto Policies. However, NGINX refused to start (init state).

From my basic understanding on how Akka works, I would say something is wrong on Ditto Policies. Logs from Ditto policies show the following warning messages:

```text
WARN  [] a.r.a.Association Association(akka://ditto-cluster) - Outbound message stream to [akka://ditto-cluster@10.10.34.68:2551] failed. Restarting it. akka.remote.artery.OutboundHandshake$HandshakeTimeoutException: Handshake with [akka://ditto-cluster@10.10.34.68:2551] did not complete within 20000 ms
```

I looked up the `10.10.34.68` IPv4 address using the following command. No pods/services were found within my cluster:

```text
{ kubectl get pods -A -oyaml && kubectl get services -A -oyaml } | grep 10.10.34.68
```


### Hypothesis

1. Akka cluster operated as expected before node failure
2. After node failure K8s re-scheduled pods as stated by their ReplicaSet
3. Akka did not pick up with K8s and used an old cluster IP address

Because that IP address is no longer in use, components were unable to communicate

### Current solution

Restart Ditto

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment ditto-gateway ditto-connectivity ditto-policies ditto-things ditto-thingssearch
```

### Expected solution

Ditto should be resilient to these kind of failures. Akka cluster should keep up with Kubernetes scheduling

We spent some time debugging our K8s networks. We also deployed Ditto on our K3s test cluster. It is a single node with a much newer Kubernetes version.

```

## Our findings

### Prometheus metrics

We checked the Prometheus metrics to find out what was happening. We made sure the `global.prometheus.enabled` key was set to `true` on the Helm chart. My Prometheus tried to scrape metrics, but was unable to do so. All ditto pods responded with the same error messages:

```
Get ""http://<addr>/"": context deadline exceeded
``` 

Our K3s cluster was having similar issues, but the error message was `connection refused` instead.

### Network troubleshooting

We launched a [dnsutils pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-debugging-resolution/) for troubleshooting and explored the network with the usual tools:

#### Scraping Prometheus metrics myself using cURL

```sh
# Obtaining the IP address
kubectl get <pod> -oyaml
curl http://<ip>:9095/ -v
```

- dnsutil on K8s: TCP handshake never succeeds. Timeout
- dnsutil on K3s: Connection refused
- Within same the container (loopback address): Works as expected. Metrics are returned

#### Ping

All packages sent from dnsutils were lost both on K3s and K8s.

#### Traceroute

- dnsutil on K8s: Address is unreachable. It just keeps sending packages that get lost

```sh
traceroute to 10.10.34.163 (10.10.34.163), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  192.168.43.233 (192.168.43.233)  0.069 ms  0.024 ms  0.020 ms
 2  * * *
 3  * * *
 4  * * *
 5  * * *
 6  * * *
...
```

- dnsutil on K3s: Only one jump. The `10.42.0.1` address is neither a service nor a pod of the cluster. Probably a virtual gateway or kube-proxy.

```sh
# traceroute 10.42.0.140
traceroute to 10.42.0.140 (10.42.0.140), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.42.0.1 (10.42.0.1)  0.246 ms  0.013 ms  0.012 ms
```


## Discussion

I've noticed that Ditto pods are the only ones to deploy `networkpolicies.networking.k8s.io` objects on my cluster. They are also the only ones with this kind of networking issues. Could those objects misconfigured? I've never seen this objects before, and frankly I have no idea on how they work. 

We also deployed Ditto with Docker compose, and it appears to be working as expected (fingers crossed). However, we would like to use Ditto within K8s. Could the Helm chart be faulty?

From my understanding, the Docker compose version uses a shared DNS name for discovery while the Kubernetes version is using Networking policies with the Akka cluster adapter. Could it be possible to leverage CoreDNS instead inside Kubernetes?

Update: [Akka has this Kubernetes example for clustering](https://github.com/akka/akka-sample-cluster-kubernetes-scala/), and they [are not using networking policies](https://github.com/akka/akka-sample-cluster-kubernetes-scala/blob/04c113ce36b9d02a078c47b43800f8d94ad4c4cb/kubernetes/akka-cluster.yml). What's the use for Networking policies in Ditto?

This solves the AskTimeoutExceptions we were experiencing[^1], as well as allowing our Prometheus to scrape metrics. We didn't experience any issues related to networking, even with pod failure.

I also took some time to learn the basics of `networkpolicies.networking.k8s.io` objects. Those objects generated by the helm chart look fine to me, except they do not allow for either ingress or egress from the Kubernetes control panel. From my understanding, Akka listens for events from the control panel and heals the cluster based on what pods are currently available. Could that be the reason why Akka didn't re-stablish connection successfully, and instead used an old ip address? 


[^1]: We obviously still have AskTimeoutExceptions after a pod failure, but Akka is able to heal itself successfully after a couple of retries.

Hm, very good finding.
To be honest, I never looked deeply into the network policies, the original helm chart was contributed to Ditto by someone with probably no Akka knowledge.

I see it as optional, however with your finding it is even dangerous to use.

Will also have a closer look into it and probably remove it from the chart.

As the reference implementation, Eclipse Thingweb did also not do that we thought that would be a common practice to move validation to eg producers of messages.

In practice I now see that an enforcement of the model by Ditto would have great benefits and is the best place to add validation. 
This would eg ensure that different API consumers always modify a thing only in the intended and modeled way.

That would be especially important if the Ditto managed twin is used in an Event driven system, where changes of the twin state is reacted to by eg issuing a command downlink to an actual device (using ""desired properties"" approach).

This issue should track:
- new config option to enable wot validation
- implementation and making configurable all of the below:
   - validation of attributes on thing level
   - validation of properties of features
   - validation of desired properties of features (ignoring ""required"" constraints) 
   - validation of thing messages
   - validation of feature messages
   - whether to allow modifying non modeled attributes/properties or to reject them
   - whether to allow sending of non modeled messages (wot actions/events) or to reject them

I expect this to be quite difficult to do, as we have to extract the JsonSchema parts from WoT TM models and apply them. 
Both when eg a complete thing is modified and also partially, when eg only a single feature or even property or even part of a property is modified.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1650/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So after enforcement (different permissions should not yield different validation results), but before applying a modify command to the persistence.

We should also monitor how much time validation takes, by adding metrics (spans) to the existing signal processing trace.

It would ne nice to have the validation as separate Java Module so that it could also be used as a library.

Configure a list of auth subjects (also supporting wildcards) for which validation is not done.

yes, if you have multiple namespaces configured on an environment that makes sense to select here.
But I thought a namespace is rather for separating bigger scopes (like a tenant) and not for very fine grained separation where you switch frequently back and forth. So my assumption was, that you configure one or two namespaces per environment and use rather different environments for different namespaces.
So if you say you have the need to frequently switch between namespaces, this could be easily done.
The only concern that might get more complex over time: we may need to extend the saved favorite filters (that should include the namespace, too. In future, separate columns and sorting per saved filter might make sense too :-) )","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85e4Z1s/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Changing the `nginx.resources.memoryMi` to 500 stops the pod from crashing. However, as an user of the Helm chart I would expect a sensible default ([currently is set to only 64 megabytes!!](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/2157ca59ea70caabf80140133cb8f367f968ae37/deployment/helm/ditto/values.yaml#L1399))

I think what probably causes this is that the `worker_processes` are configured (by default) to `auto` in nginx - and that takes the amount of available CPUs into consideration.  
As I did always run Ditto on quite small worker-nodes (with max. 4 or 8 CPUs), for that 64mB of memory is sufficient.

For the `dittoui` we did not adjust the `worker_processes`, for the other `nginx` we did however configure them to be `1`.

Also found this explanation here: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8166#issuecomment-1448272934

You probably have a lot more CPUs available (also according to the `dittoui` logs.  
So you would need to adjust the values to your needs, if you need to configure the used `worker_processes`, please provide a PR and we will surely add it to the official chart.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85fnX2q/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Indeed. Each node has more than 100 cores

I think so. Version 3.2.0 worked fine for me on the same cluster, and it used the max requests setting. [I also found this](https://home.robusta.dev/blog/stop-using-cpu-limits)

Yes, however that will not be done as default value in the Ditto chart.
As when eg running on a 4 core node, 64 MB is totally sufficient.

Another option would be to limit the amount of workers by default in the chart, maybe even make them configurable.

This worked fine on previous versions of Ditto, notably 3.1.4 and 3.2.0. Looks like there is a mismatch between the Helm chart configuration and the actual requirements of Ditto, or just a small bug.

Other endpoints appear to work fine. I've tried to retrieve a policy and connections. Creating a Thing also works.

It's a whole different namespace, without database persistence. We are working on figuring how the new version works before doing the actual migration. Fresh start, except the cluster of course.

The new helm chart defines ""reasonable"" MongoDB readConcerns / writeConcerns / readPreferences, etc.

In order for Ditto's search to be guaranteed consistent when working with ""search-persisted"" requested ACK, the `queryReadConcern` needs to be `""linearizable""` when used in a MongoDB replica set (which should for productive use cases used).

However, for starting the included referenced ""MongoDB"" dependency with a single node (and no replica set), using the `""linearizable""` `queryReadConcern` is just wrong and the Mongo driver throws the mentioned exception.

Fix:
Change the `queryReadConcern` to `""local""`:

For a fix in the chart I think it would make sense to check when `mongodb.enabled = true` (and maybe as well when no replica set was configured via the mongo chart settings) to change the `queryReadConcern` to `""local""`.

I don't think thats the right approach. It will probably backfire on someone else using the chart. From my perspective, the default should be local, the same way the default installation of Mongo is a single instance. If someone tries to use their own local mongo, chances are it's a single instance.

This is definitely a major task to do, for several reasons:
* authorization must be ensured when retrieving policies

* pagination must be implemented

* filtering and sorting could be optional IMO

   * queries like: ""find me all policies in which user <xyz> is contained"" would also be useful

Ok, sorting by policyId by default is sufficient for the start. 
Pagination (default page size 25, max 200, same as for things) however would be required also in a first version. 

> I can give it a try. I have little experience with Akka but I'm familiar with MongoDB. Do you have any suggestions on how to tackle this issue? My first option is to take a look at the things endpoint and base the implementation on it.

Yes, good idea.
That endpoint however just uses the search, which then builds his own search index for things in MongoDB.
For the policies search (which should also be implemented in the ""things-search"" service.. I know, bad naming, but it makes sense to also do it there instead of creating a new service) an own search index with some policy related fields should be added.

As policies have a more restrictive format than things I think we do not need a wildcard index (as we have for things).
But we still need to add the subjects allowed to READ something in the policy to the new policy search index.
In oder to be able to quickly filter all visible policies for a user.

For the explorer UI it should be sufficient to always read and update the complete policy.
Partial changes are nice to have, but not really required.

It would be kind of mandatory to have if you eg only have permissions to WRITE a specific part of a policy like a single entry or only subjects of an entry.

Your proposal on the layout looks very good and makes sense from my point of view.

The idea about the recent policies is also good.
The community is currently working on a policy search in PR #1698, maybe this can, in the future, be also used for browsing policies with a search slot.
But for now (and the policy search is a rather big topic which will probably take longer), your approach is the best we can do.

Regarding double click vs single click : I don't like that too much, as this is not really intuitively usable.
Maybe we could just add a button to navigate to the imported policy, next to the ""copy to clipboard"" icon?

That seems like the wrong place IMO. 
Just because we have for AWS SNS special escaping requirements we should not adjust basically all payload mappers.  
Because reversing the escaping would have to be done by everyone receiving events by Ditto. 
This would even be a breaking change for connections and protocols where this is not an issue and `=` is already used in headers. 

> or another fix could be to update the example of the script in  [AWS SNS integration](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-hmac-signing.html#aws-sns) to encode the dittoHeaders like:

Sure, that would be the easiest solution. 
But still decoding would be required on the other side of SNS. 

Or even not to map all incoming headers as Ditto headers to send to SNS, only selected ones.  
Thinking about that, this is rather dumb to just send all headers without sanatizing them.

I'm exploring the messaging functionality using this page https://eclipse.dev/ditto/protocol-specification-things-messages.html#responding-to-a-message. It seems quite straightforward, but I'm wondering if it's possible to avoid using this part:

`var outboxPath = originalMessage.path.replace(""inbox"", ""outbox"");`

Based on the examples, it appears that the way a thing responds to a message is always the same and could be added to the MQTT5 binding directly. Did I miss something in the documentation? Is it not possible?

I've looked into header mapping, but since we need to replace something in the path, it doesn't seem to fit. Perhaps it's possible with a mapping context, but I couldn't find any sample code for mapping from Ditto to the target.

Thank you.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1708/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The key was to set content type inside the enveloppe and not as the MQTT content type.

Doing the same thing on websocket side leads to a different behaviour , we still have the unicode point in the value.

```
import WebSocket from 'ws';

// connect to the WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://ditto:ditto@localhost:8080/ws/2');

    },

};

ws.on('open', function open() {
    ws.send('START-SEND-MESSAGES');
});

  if ( data == ""START-SEND-MESSAGES:ACK"") {
    console.log(' < received:\n %s', data);

There are no visible WARN/ERROR logs in Ditto related to a specific thing ID, as well as there doesn't seem to be any indication of dropped messages by an mqtt-connection (because the failed case never reaches it as observed in connection logs).

Restart of both devices doesn't change anything.
However, there is one extra log statement found related to the failing device:

In order to see whether the removal happened, one needs to either refresh the page, or deselect and select the thing in question again.

Considering that adding or modifying things via patch requests results in the selected thing in the UI being updated right away, I suspect this could be a bug.

For example, a patch request with the following body would result in the updated ""brewingTemp"" being visible right away in the UI for the selected thing, but ""brewed-coffees"" would also be visible until a page is refreshed, or the thing was deselected and selected again.

I think that is due to the nature of Ditto's [Server Sent Event](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/httpapi-sse.html#sse-api-things) API which the Ditto UI makes use of.  
When something is deleted, the SSE will only get a notification like:
```json
{}

What could help is to provide some kind of optional ""context"" (e.g. with the original Ditto Protocol information) when subscribing to the SSE.

For example, if the current weather for a ""thing"" shall be retrievable by sending a message to the digital twin, it would be very convenient to just be able to configure:
```json

Twin events are not sent to the connection that triggered them. This means:
- for connections
when there is one connection that has source to update device twin and target to send twin events, twin events are not sent; if twin was updated using another connection or HTTP API, or WebSocket API, the events is sent
- for WebSocket API
commands that update device twin do not trigger sending twin events to the same connection, but trigger sending to other WebSockets and connections

For example, I have following AMQP 0.9.1 connection defined:

```json
{
  ""id"": ""amqp-twins"",
  ""connectionType"": ""amqp-091"",
  ""connectionStatus"": ""open"",
  ""uri"": ""amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672/%2F"",
  ""sources"": [
    {
      ""addresses"": [
        ""commands""
      ],
      ""qos"": 2,
      ""authorizationContext"": [
        ""nginx:ditto""
      ]
    }
  ],
  ""targets"": [
    {

      ""qos"": 2,
      ""authorizationContext"": [
        ""nginx:ditto""
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

It reads command in Ditto protocol format from `commands` queue and sends twin events to default exchange with `twin-events` routing key (which effectively delivers them to `twin-events` queue). When I merge thing using HTTP API, I see the event sent, but not when I use `commands` queue.

I was able to replicate this behavior using MQTT 5 connection as well.

My expectation is that events should be sent always regardless of which connection or API triggered them. Or maybe this behavior is expected and is worth noting in documentation.

Indeed this is intentionally done this way.
Events are not delivered to the source which caused them, as this source also gets a response confirming the command was applied.

It is easier to just create a second connection for receiving events than to filter out events which were caused ""by the source itself"" on source/client side. That was the motivation behind this. 

If it is not documented, then it should be, I agree.

Alternatively, it could be made configurable on connection and websocket level. With the default being the current behavior.

Live message value in JS (argument `value` in `mapFromDittoProtocolMsg` function) outgoing payload mapper is sometimes base64-encoded, sometimes not. It seems to be dependent on content-type: if payload is TEXT or JSON, then payload is left intact, otherwise it's base64-encoded. There is no way for JS mapper to know it other than check content-type.

## Details

My use case is following: I want to allow sending any headers in the message, for example, all headers starting with ""x-"" (e.g., ""x-my-header"") should be forwarded as message headers (MQTT 5 in my setup) without ""x-"" prefix (e.g., ""my-header""). The payload should not be changed. Messages might be sent with any content-type. AFAIK, the easiest way to do this is by using JS payload mapper.

I noticed that depending on content-type, that the message is sent with, its payload might be base64-encoded. Looks like, the logic for this is:

```java
    // messages/model/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/messages/model/signals/commands/MessagePayloadSerializer.java
    static <T> void serialize(final Message<T> message, final JsonObjectBuilder messageBuilder,
            final Predicate<JsonField> predicate) {

        final Optional<ByteBuffer> rawPayloadOptional = message.getRawPayload();
        final Optional<T> payloadOptional = message.getPayload();
        final ContentType contentType = message.getContentType().map(ContentType::of).orElse(ContentType.of(""""));
        final JsonValue payloadValue;
        if (rawPayloadOptional.isPresent() && !payloadOptional.filter(JsonValue.class::isInstance).isPresent()) {
            final ByteBuffer rawPayload = rawPayloadOptional.get();
            if (MessageDeserializer.shouldBeInterpretedAsTextOrJson(contentType)) {
                payloadValue =
                        interpretAsJsonValue(new String(rawPayload.array(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8), contentType);
            } else {
                final ByteBuffer base64Encoded = BASE64_ENCODER.encode(rawPayload);
                payloadValue = JsonFactory.newValue(new String(base64Encoded.array(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
            }
        } else if (payloadOptional.isPresent()) {
            final T payload = payloadOptional.get();
            payloadValue = payload instanceof JsonValue
                    ? (JsonValue) payload
                    : interpretAsJsonValue(payload.toString(), contentType);
        } else {
            payloadValue = null;
        }
        injectMessagePayload(messageBuilder, predicate, payloadValue, message.getHeaders());
    }


    // messages/model/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/messages/model/signals/commands/MessageDeserializer.java
    public static boolean shouldBeInterpretedAsTextOrJson(final ContentType contentTypeHeader) {
        return contentTypeHeader.isText() || contentTypeHeader.isJson();
    }
```

But in payload mapper there is simply no way to find out if the payload was encoded. No way other than checking content-type by itself. What I did to work this around is:

- created my own JS function (inside payload mapper code) that determines if content-type is text or json according to logic in java class ContentType
- used it to return either `textPayload` from `value` as is, or `bytePayload` as `dcodeIO.ByteBuffer.fromBase64(value).toArrayBuffer()`

## Expected Result

1. I'd like this behavior to be documented, for example under [Mapping outgoing messages](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-mapping.html#mapping-outgoing-messages) section on Payload Mapping page.
2. It would be great to have function, e.g., Ditto.isTextContentType/Ditto.isJsonContentType, or Ditto.isPayloadBase64Encoded, that will reflect code from java class ContentType that decides parsing strategy based on content-type.

# Suggestions

## Use JRE instead of JDK

I'm not Java developer, so might miss something basic here, but isn't JRE enough to run Ditto? I tried building images locally using `eclipse-temurin:17-jre` and everything worked fine. I was able even to attach via debugger (by adding some Java parameters, of course), so it should be good for developer version (file dockerfile-snapshot) as well.

JRE image is somewhat less than JDK, so it should save some traffic and space for everyone.

## Use curl instead of wget

In dockerfile-release wget is installed and used. curl is built-in and provides needed functionality.

## Clean up after `apt-get update`

`apt-get update` downloads some information and, if not removed, it's included into final image. According to the internet, adding `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` would be enough.

## Reuse build cache

### Split steps into reusable parts

RUN steps produce new layers. If command text matches cached layer (and if they both base on the same layer), the layer will be reused, which saves time for building and (I guess) traffic when downloading images that use the same layer.

Splitting RUN steps into static and dynamic parts will produce more layers, but layers from static commands will be resused.

### Move ARG and ENV right before where they are used

ARG and ENV implicitly invalidate cache when they change, even when they are not used. For example, running following command will build an image:

```sh
docker build - --build-arg VERSION=1 <<DF
FROM docker.io/eclipse-temurin:17-jre
ARG VERSION
RUN apt-get update
DF
```

Running the same command with same VERSION once again will reuse build cache. But if you change VERSION value, the cached layer will not be reused despite VERSION argument has not been used in the command.

# Results

`nightly` tag is the Ditto nightly image, 0-SNAPSHOT is the image I've built locally with updated dockerfile-release:

```sh
DOCKERFILE=dockerfile-release SERVICE_VERSION=0-RELEASE ./build-images.sh

# Drawbacks

## Cache

Sometimes it makes sense to build images without cache - to get fresh version of `tini`, for instance.

If you want clean build, i.e., without using cached layers, you have several options:
- add `--no-cache` option to `docker build`
- clean cached layers using `docker builder prune -f`  
warning: the command does not remove layers for existing images, so you'll need to remove all images that use the layer and then run the command

It might be good to introduce something like NO_DOCKER_CACHE variable for build-images.sh script that will pass ""--no-cache"" option if set.

In pipeline script it looks like buildx is installed right before building images, so cache should not be an issue here. Moreover, the build will build static RUN steps (like, `apt-get update && apt-get install tini`) once and then reuse them for next images which, to me, seems better then building without cache entirely and run all static RUN steps for each image.

I don't really agree to swap JDK out for JRE is a good idea. 

Yes, Ditto will also run with a JRE.
However, a JRE does not come with many helpful tools for eg creating heapdumps or inspecting the JVM parameters during runtime by executing into the container and eg invoking `jcmd`.

See also https://www.baeldung.com/running-jvm-diagnose

I would not want to limit these possibilities to just save some MB when pulling the first of the 6 Ditto images.

So the current behaviour for all `POST` methods is:
* an ID is automatically created by Ditto
* if an ID is provided in the payload, a ""Bad Request"" is returned with the hint that setting the id for a newly created entity is not supported 
   * the exception texts for creating policies and things are better as they mention the HTTP verb `POST` or e.g. mention: `To provide your own Thing ID use a PUT request instead`

According to the logs, messages are delivered and acknowledged before Ditto subscribes to topics. My guess is that it is how MQTT 5 protocol works - when you connect to existing session, you get messages, that are awaiting for you, right after the connection is established.

Another strange thing is the first 2 lines - some connection is opened and closed before connection with client ID ditto is established.

The last one strange thing is that Ditto subscribes twice for each topic.

Those strange things are definitely out of scope of this ticket, but they might provide some clue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85obBqH/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This was rewritten to use the [reactive API of the HiveMQ MQTT Client](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client#reactive-api) in Ditto 3.0.0.

We also faced some problems with the HiveMQ MQTT client, e.g.: https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client/issues/544
So I would also not rule out a client problem. 

Unfortunately, the Ditto committer who is most experienced on the MQTT implementation is no longer contributing actively to Ditto and I currently don't find time to deep dive into it as well.

- integration test: we run mqtt broker, e.g., mosquitto, and test some actor/actors with real mqtt connection
- system test: we spin up whole ditto installation, mqtt broker etc. and test the scenarios we need.

I'd like the first approach, because integration test would be faster and we'd be able to cover more scenarios. I see that there is test code that launches mongo DB, so it looks okay to have such kind of tests. Also having tests in this repo will confirm that the functionality works as expected when doing later changes by running PR checks, without need to remember to run system tests manually.
Having system test is also okay, as to me, especially if such base setup already exists (I guess, repo [ditto-testing](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto-testing) is exactly for this).

The only problem with that is, that we do not have a runner capable of running those tests - the infrastructure by the Eclipse Foundation is too limited to run the system-tests.  

The colleagues from Bosch still have an internal CI where they can run the tests.

Locally, you should be able to run the tests as well - however the system-tests for the ""connectivity"" part of Ditto are quite complex (with a lot of inheritance), so it is also not quite easy ..

It would be of course more flexible to have it configurable and only as default have `_namespace` + wildcard on everything.  
That way someone could e.g. also only index `_namespace` + all thing attributes only.

I also don't have experience on how this would influence query performance - maybe it would be good to test manually defining such a compound index to a big dataset and check if query performance is really improved when querying with a namespace.

First evaluated compound wildcard index:

> '_namespace'
> '$**',
> wildcardProjection:
> {       
>    _id: 0,       gr: 0,       _revision: 0,       policyId: 0,       __policyRev: 0,       p: 0,       'f.p': 0     }
> }

It was performing much worse than the current clean $**.
Also since the occasional slow queries are involving lots of verifications on authorization subjects of fields.
mostly the fields involved are: 

> gr: 1
> p.features.featureId.·g: 1
> p.features.featureId.properties.propValue.·r: 1
> p.features.featureId.properties.·r: 1
> p.features.featureId.·r: 1
> t.features.featureId.properties.propValue: 1

so to cover them an index that covers:
""gr"" and with a wildcard for the (`""p.features.featureId.$*"", ""f.features.$*""`) or (`""p.features.featureId.$*"", ""f.features.featureId.$*""`)  would be nice but gr is an array and arrays can't be used with compound wildcard indexes.

For now i will not look in to it more.

```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-User $remote_user;
proxy_set_header x-ditto-pre-authenticated ""nginx:$remote_user"";

directly in the default values.yaml at ingress.api.annotations.

Currently they are configured within the ingress.controller. I think the majority of the Kubernetes clusters out there have already set up a working nginx ingress controller for multiple different applications. If an additional application will be installed its normally a straight forward process of editing the values.yaml and make some minor configurations at the ingress section.
But with ditto it is currently not as straight forward as it could be because you have to figure out that these two headers have to be added.

I am not a full-time Kubernetes admin and it is possible that I make incorrect assumptions, please correct me if that is the case.

You cannot compare if a JsonObject is ""greater than"" another JsonObject in a meaningful way.

How to test?
E.g. via `ThingPredicatePredicateVisitorTest` for the Java based predicate evaluation.

It is often useful to provide certain statistics about the amount of ""Things"" managed within Ditto, for example:
* displaying the total amount of currently Things being in a ""ERROR"" state
* displaying the total amount of provisioned Things
* displaying the total of Things which were not yet ""connected""
* ...

In order to provide this kind of information e.g. to display on a Grafana dashboard, an idea would be to provide those as `DittoMetrics`.
This would provide metrics complementing Ditto's [exported metrics for operating Ditto](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/installation-operating.html#gathered-metrics) - on the same Prometheus endpoint to be scraped by Prometheus - directly from the ""things-search"" service in Ditto.

The idea is that a Ditto operator/admin can then configure ""searches"" in e.g. the search configuration `search.conf`, e.g. providing a label.
Rough idea:
```hocon
operator-metrics {

  scrape-interval = 15m

  produced_cars = {
    namespaces = [
      ""io.acme.corp.cars""
    ]

  }
  errors_in_lamps = {
    scrape-interval = 1m
    namespaces = [
      ""io.acme.corp.bulbs"",
      ""io.acme.corp.leds""

For the incoming messages, you could even provide an RQL expression and do server side filtering (when opening the SSE / EventSource).

Eg in order to receive all updates to a certain feature only:
```
exists(feature/important)
```
Problematic is that you will miss updates to all other features and cannot simply change the filter to show eg already received updates of other features. 

Benefit is that this is super efficient and also makes use of the same RQL as for the search. 

I assume you want to do client side filtering?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85s4gol/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I see the purpose more like a log for debugging. So you don't know before what you are searching for. I thought already that it is a drawback that you need to select the thing before that you want to ""watch"".

Since the fix for #1712, the SSE has become verbose. I remember now that before we merged the ""delta"" into the known state of the thing on the client-side.

Can you nowadays still see what part of the Thing was modified? We have a lot of different components on the edge that in parallel update different features of a thing, so it was nice to see the deltas only. So you can better debug what the edge components are doing (if they update full features or modify only the relevant part of a feature.

So I would argue that also for that reason it would make sense to reduce the SSE events as much as possible to the modification that happened to the Thing. Don't know if #1712 can still be fixed with that condition.

Btw. I am evaluating different options for the filtering. Next to plain javascript, Lodash would provide some support (which is no longer used) and also JSONata looks interesting. Currently I tend to plain javascript.

> So I would argue that also for that reason it would make sense to reduce the SSE events as much as possible to the modification that happened to the Thing. Don't know if #1712 can still be fixed with that condition.

We would still be able to do that by not selecting all fields of the thing as ""extraFields"". The benefits of selecting all the fields is that Ditto can correctly merge in the backend. Which is just not possible in the frontend one, because of deletions via PATCH, which don't show up in the delta.
So #1712 can't be fixed if reverting to the old behavior. 

We could either make the behavior configurable (per environment for example or directly on the things page) or we could even subscribe for 2 event streams, one with complete thing for the json and features views and editors. And one for the incoming messages at the bottom. 

By the way: with Ditto 3.4, selecting the new ""Context only"" option at the incoming messages select will show only the delta, available in ""_context/value"". 
That's why I added the select in the first place, because I could also no longer quickly see the delta.

Yes, I have to agree - it is annoying and confusing to always search an expected feature at a different place.

Maybe highlighting with a color could work well, yes ..
E.g. for the table cell background do a background color with opacity depending on the most recent updated - e.g. color the 5 most recently updated features - the most recent one having the strongest opacity and the least recently updated of the 5 having the weakest opacity.

- it would have to be configurable via environment if this map widget shall be shown or not

   - eg by defining either which ""feature name"" or ""definition"" shall be used to extract the geo coordinates

   - those location information could also even be a part of the thing attributes. Often location of devices does not change once installed, so I would put it into attributes (static metadata)

It does raise further expectations. So it does not really fit / it should not be there.
Spontaneous thought: Do not include it into the Ditto UI but provide some plug-in / extension point. Then create it even in a separate project like ""examples"" or ""showcases"".

you are right, the target user group need to be considered.
Initially I thought about a separate dedicated example ui project.
But on the other hand, there are currently already two different user groups addressed. I personally never use the operations tab, so this addresses a ""ditto operator"" rather than a ""ditto admin"".
A environment has already some support for this, by hiding tabs that are not needed.

So a valid option would be to increase the ability to customize in the existing UI. As discussed, domain specific and ditto independent code must be kept separately.

All together, rather long term ideas...

We encountered that in such a case, only the first field will be enriched, the `features/{{feature:id}}/properties/configuration` will be ignored. Changing the order does not make a difference.

The cause is not yet really clear to me - maybe because of the `{{feature:id}}` placeholder or maybe because `configuration/mode` is a part of `configuration`.

Has to be investigated in order to fix.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1826/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

As @JeffreyThijs  stated, we were able to fetch the ids only. When I did that, I got back a list of approx. 20 connections being active in ditto. I manually tried fetching them because I wanted to check the contents of the connection. I stumbled upon one with id `327bfa0b-1984-4c50-8700-9adb1579e6e1` (the ID doesn't mind but if you look closely, it's the one that is mentioned in the log line Jeffrey posted before.
I went looking for it in mongoDB and saw 46 records in the `connection_journal` table with pid `connection:327bfa0b-1984-4c50-8700-9adb1579e6e1`. it showed following records:
```
  {
    _id: ObjectId(""646f79710d77134491007ae2""),
    pid: 'connection:327bfa0b-1984-4c50-8700-9adb1579e6e1',
    from: Long(""60""),
    to: Long(""60""),
    events: [
      {
        v: 1,
        pid: 'connection:327bfa0b-1984-4c50-8700-9adb1579e6e1',
        sn: Long(""60""),
        _t: 'bson',
        p: {
          type: 'persistence-actor-internal:empty-event',
          effect: 'alwaysAlive',
          __hh: {}
        },
        _tg: [ 'always-alive', 'priority-0' ],
        manifest: 'persistence-actor-internal:empty-event',
        _w: '9393e517-419d-4ade-9338-500780c519eb'
      }
    ],
    v: 1,
    _tg: [ 'always-alive', 'priority-0' ]
  }
```
Since I don't know what this is for, I manually removed all of these records out of the collection and restarted the ditto-connectivity pods. After that, we were able to fetch the ditto connections again using the HTTP GET endpoint.
Something to note: the connection count in ditto dropped from 20 to 7.
Any idea what might be going on? We experienced this in our development environment now and would like to avoid this in our production environment. It's worthy to mention that we recently upgraded ditto from 3.3.7 to 3.4.3","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85t_N60/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is probably my fault, not yours, and I am sorry.
I'd love to get an opportunity to fix this, please report as an issue at:
 https://github.com/MutabilityDetector/MutabilityDetector/issues/ 
Pasting in this error message and stack trace, and if possible, 
information about the code causing the error. 
For example, one of: 
    .class files (preferably with source);
    compilable .java files; 
    a jar (again preferably with source);
    or, if your project is open source, information on where I can get the code from
        (I'm happy to checkout and build your project in order to investigate the error).

Apologies, and thank you for using Mutability Detector.

https://matrix.to/#/!NgApgwRGamBVNEqzNU:gitter.im/$u8zsUQZHfuBIrIp-LdnIta8TajCGMoNVrEXSqxFdw14?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=othermo.ems.host

Ditto clusting uses Apache Pekko, formerly Akka.
I found this blogpost from the Lightbend team that since k8s 1.22 the default behavior to downscale pods changed:
https://www.lightbend.com/blog/faster-and-smoother-rolling-updates-for-akka-clusters-in-kubernetes

This is the related Akka Management  issue: https://github.com/akka/akka-management/issues/1130

Akka management fixed this issue in 1.3, which we however cannot use because of its license.

So there are a few options IMO to stablisize this in Ditto:
* disable on k8s cluster level the `LogarithmicScaleDown` flag
* change pod deletion cost to have the most cost for the cluster role leader for each Ditto service role
   * either as part of Ditto codebase (however Ditto is not aware of k8s)
   * or as contribution to Pekko management
   * or maybe as sidecar container / script?
   * or as custom k8s operator for Ditto

Just to provide some ideas..

A custom operator might also for other reasons be useful, eg in order to rolling update Ditto service by service instead of all at services at once.

@kalinkostashki maybe you also have an idea? ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1839/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

From what I looked a bit there are several approaches:

1. Create a per service Helm charts and one wrapper chart like it was in eclipse packages:
    Benefits:

    -  you enable per service upgrades via hooks post-install, pre-upgrade, etc.
    -  this should fundamentally solve the issue you are talking about

    Negatives:

    - you create a more complex chart structure which is harder to maintain and will include code duplications I assume
    - Helm hooks and the way they behave may be a problem from the reading that I've done so it would be bad to avoid them -> for example what happens if a post install step fails for some reason...

2. Create per service Helm charts only
    Benefits:

    -  you enable per service upgrades via manually calling helm upgrade of a service
    -  this should fundamentally solve the issue you are talking about 

     Negatives:

    - you create a more complex chart structure which is harder to maintain and will **for sure** cause code duplications I assume

3. Custom operator that registers CRDs for each service(the thing you proposed):
    Benefits:

    -  no code duplications like previous approaches
    -  you enable per service upgrades via manually calling helm upgrade of a service
    -  this should fundamentally solve the issue you are talking about 
    -  due to not knowing the exactly when or how Pekko project will address this we will get some autonomy and flexibility
    -  it is shiny and cool ;)

    Negatives:

    - creation of yet another API that has to be supported -> this is kind of innevatible I feel but has to be considered

I personally think contribution to Pekko would harder(at least for my limited experience).
The other approaches that you mention like side-cars are also fine, but are just a patch.
The disabling of a kubernetes feature like **LogarithmicScaleDown** I'm not sure is even possible with cloud providers.

Given all that I think the operator is the way to Go(pun intended :)).
This will make Ditto more flexible and enable the way for other features like autoscaling based on specific metrics, etc -> sure you can think of more cool stuff :)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85uhN3C/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Idea is to register a ""pre-upgrade"" Hook to:
* Configure RBAC to be allowed to exec into pods + perform `kubectl annotate`
* Retrieve the cluster membership information by doing `kubectl exec $pod -- curl http://localhost:7626/cluster/members/`
* Parsing the cluster membership for the ""leader"" and the ""oldest"" for each role
* Calculate higher pod deletion cost for those ""leader"" and ""oldest""
* Add `controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost` annotation via `kubectl annotate --overwrite pods $pod controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost=600` for all ""old"" nodes

This will not yet fix/resolve that we want to update one Ditto service after another instead of all at once.  
But maybe this can also be solved with another pre-upgrade hook .. maybe using a [lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/) to store the currently updated service before proceeding to the next?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85vx8lA/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In this case, a JSON skeleton of the Thing based on the WoT TM is created.  
Over time, a WoT ThingModel might however evolve, e.g. new `properties`, new `actions` or new `submodels`, etc. are added.

Those evolvements can be categorised in:
* non-breaking evolvements (according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) changes to the **MINOR** version):
   * only additions to existing functionality without removing existing properties/actions/events
* breaking evolvements (according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) changes to the **MAJOR** version)
   * also containing breaking functionality with renaming/removing existing properties/actions/events
   * **out of scope for this issue** - as this would require e.g. also deleting stuff from things or renaming

In my experience, non-breaking evolvements can happen very regularly, as the (exposed) functionality of IoT devices evolves quickly over time.  
For such non-breaking evolvements, Ditto shall provide means to ""migrate"" existing things to a newer **MINOR** version of referenced WoT ThingModels.

Concretely, the following steps would have be done when updating the **minor** version of a WoT ThingModel in a Ditto thing's `definition`:
* `definition` of a **Thing** is modified (either via `ModifyDefinition` or via `MergeThing` for the `""definition""`)
* Ditto checks if the ""minor"" version increased - and only if it did - performs a ""migration"":
   * resolving all ""submodel"" versions of the new ""minor"" thing model
   * update all feature `definition` fields with the updated ""submodel"" models
   * potentially adding previously non-yet-existing features in the process
   * for existing features / ""submodels"" which received a **minor** update, for each pair of `<old model version>,<new model version>`:
      * generate JSON skeleton for `<old model version>`
      * generate JSON skeleton for `<new model version>`
      * calculate the ""diff"" as Json Merge Patch from new to old JSON skeleton
      * for all ""new added"" (non-optional) properties:
         * create the property with the defined `default` value
         * but only if the Thing does not yet contain a ""real"" value for the property yet (which could already be sent by the real device - we don't want to overwrite ""real"" values with default values)

The algorithm might still not be ""complete"" - but in a nutshell, we have to handle:
* updating Thing `attributes` with default values for new TM ""properties""
* updating Feature `properties`  with default values for new TM ""properties""
* updating Feature `definition`s
* updating the Thing's `definition` if all was successful
   * TODO: what to do in case of an error?

The endpoint enables model migration using a high-level Thing definition URL, combined with precise RQL-based filtering and conditional patching. This approach allows users to selectively apply updates based on specific conditions within each feature, avoiding unnecessary changes and enhancing control over the migration process.

### Key Features

- Unified Thing Definition URL:

The endpoint accepts a single Thing definition URL, simplifying the input and eliminating the need to specify each individual feature’s definition.
Ditto will automatically resolve all feature definitions and apply them as needed across targeted devices.

- RQL-Based Filtering for Device Selection:

Users can specify an RQL query in the filter parameter to select devices based on attributes, feature presence, or other conditions.
This allows for precise targeting of devices that match specific criteria, ensuring updates are only applied where needed.

- Conditional Feature Patching with RQL:

The migrationPayload supports feature-specific patchConditions using RQL expressions, enabling granular control over updates.
Conditions such as property existence, threshold comparisons, and complex logical combinations can be defined for each feature to ensure updates are only applied when specified conditions are met.
This approach allows for highly targeted updates, reducing redundant changes and optimizing the migration process.

- Flexible Control Over Feature Addition and Property Initialization:

The endpoint provides options to control whether missing features should be added (addMissingFeatures) and whether properties in newly added features should be initialized (initializeProperties).
This ensures that users can manage updates carefully, without creating unnecessary data for inactive or unconfigured devices.
### Proposed Endpoint Specification
**Endpoint:** POST /things/update-definition
Request Parameters:

- thingDefinitionUrl: The URL for the high-level Thing definition.

- filter: An RQL expression specifying the target devices for the migration.

- migrationPayload: A structured set of operations for each feature, including RQL-based patchConditions.

- addMissingFeatures (optional, boolean): Default false. Controls whether missing features should be added.

- initializeProperties (optional, boolean): Default false. Specifies if default values should be set for properties in new features.

- validationMode (optional, string): Options include warn (default) or strict, controlling the response to wot-model validation for the updates.

```

The currently implemented time placeholders are:
* `time:now`
* `time:now_epoch_millis`

It would be very useful to be able to also specify a plus and minus offset to ""now"":
* e.g. querying all of the things which were modified in the last 1 day
* e.g. counting all of the things which have a ISO8601 timestamp persisted which is more recent than 2 hours

Syntax idea:
To keep it simple, the existing placeholders could support optionally the following syntax:
```
<sign> := + | -

<unit> := ""ms"" | ""s"" | ""m"" | ""h"" | ""d""
<dittoDuration> := <integer><unit>

<offset> := <sign><dittoDuration>

time:now<offset>
time:now_epoch_millis<offset>
```
Where Ditto duration is defined by implementation class `DittoDuration`.

Examples:
* `time:now-5h` - current ISO8601 timestamp minus 5 hours
* `time:now_epoch_millis+2d` - current epoch timestamp plus 2 days
* `time:now+30s` - current ISO8601 timestamp plus 30 seconds","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1854/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Unfortunately, that is not possible. Payload mappings in Ditto are sandboxed quite strictly and there is no functionality (yet) to lookup things during a payload mapping.

hi,
Using Java jar package is it also running in sandbox?
My application scenario is like this, the OBU device is installed on the vehicle and sends vehicle location information, I have created a new Vehicle-Thing and OBU-Thing and I need to update the vehicle location information to the Vehicle-Thing. So I need to query the related Vehicle-ThingId set on the OBU-Thing using the deviceId reported by the OBU.
Also, I want to be notified when the relation between OBU and vehicle has been changed.
I need some help with this.

Ah, you're right - with a Java based payload mapper you should be able to do anything - e.g. calling the Ditto HTTP API in order to lookup another thing.
But keep in mind that payload mappings should not take long, as that would limit the throughput of message processing heavily.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85wNtMt/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

<sup>Originally posted by **dimabarbul** January 12, 2024</sup>
We deploy Ditto (tried 3.4.0 and 3.4.4) using helm chart.  Sometimes, for example, during cluster upgrade, we face following issue.

Things service loses connection to mongo (this is expected as during cluster upgrade mongo might be temporarily unavailable). But later when mongo is back online things service does not reconnect. In logs we can see errors `com.mongodb.MongoTimeoutException: Timed out after 30000 ms while waiting for a server that matches ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary}. Client view of cluster state is {type=REPLICA_SET, srvResolutionException=com.mongodb.MongoConfigurationException: Failed looking up SRV record for '_mongodb._tcp.default-psmdb-db-rs0.databases.svc.cluster.local'.` But /alive and /ready health check endpoints return OK. Request to http://ditto-gateway:8080/health returns 503 as expected. We waited for more than an hour and the issue did not go away.

The only way that we found where we can see this error (apart from logs) is request to http://ditto-things:8080/status/health. The problem with this approach is that port 8080 is not declared in helm chart and thus is not accessible for k8s health probes.

Restarting the pod fixes the issue, but the problem is that this restart has to be manual as k8s does not see any issues.

As discussed, it would be good to create class that would check subsystem health and could be used as Pekko management health check.

@thjaeckle I'm not sure about if the class should be included by default to liveness (or readiness) checks or this possibility should be just documented. Could you, please, advise?

This issue has different cause.

When connectivity service is being stopped, it stops all connections **and unsubscribes** ([link to code](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/f2904efcb447fc0734cd7ed2ff6ec4967e10fb79/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/mqtt/hivemq/MqttClientActor.java#L226)) from all MQTT topics. In MQTT if client unsubscribes from topic, then new messages for this topic will not be kept by broker in the client session and will not be delivered on next client connect. This means that even if connection has ""cleanSession"" set to false and ""qos"" 1 or 2, the messages will not be delivered when connectivity service will start again.

Following are my thoughts on that.
My initial idea was to not do unsubscribing for MQTT at all. For cases if we do not need session (for example, we set ditto.connectivity.connection.mqtt.session-expiry-interval to 0s) this will have no impact as broker will discard session upon client disconnect.
But this approach will not work for edge case when we change list of topic we want to subscribe to. Apart from session, broker  remembers client subscriptions in session: if client subscribed to topic ""topic1"", then disconnected and connected back, it will be subscribed to ""topic1"" and will receive all new messages for this topic. So if we change list of topics for connection and do not change client ID, the client will receive messages from all previous and newly subscribed topics.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1868/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

My thoughts:
* Yes, I also think, we should not `unsubscribe` from the MqttClient in `stopConsuming()`
* But we should `unsubscribe` in other cases (as you mentioned regarding e.g. the topic change):
   * when a connection is actively `closed`
   * when a connection is edited
      * even more sophisticated would be of course to only `unsubscribe` when ""relevant"" parts were edited, e.g. the topics to consume from changed","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85xQYqD/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

But from what I read I don't see possibility (for now) to distinguish between closing connection and modifying connection.
I checked [CloseConnectionStrategy.java](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/3f6be0f5c0d7884055c6635157426916ef3f2125/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/persistence/strategies/commands/CloseConnectionStrategy.java#L56) and [ModifyConnectionStrategy.java](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/3f6be0f5c0d7884055c6635157426916ef3f2125/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/persistence/strategies/commands/ModifyConnectionStrategy.java#L97) and they do the same things when connection is open, but now should be closed: close connection, stop actor:

```java
    actions = Arrays.asList(ConnectionAction.PERSIST_AND_APPLY_EVENT, ConnectionAction.UPDATE_SUBSCRIPTIONS, ConnectionAction.CLOSE_CONNECTION,
            ConnectionAction.STOP_CLIENT_ACTORS, ConnectionAction.SEND_RESPONSE);
```

Moreover, modifying of open connection closes it first, then stops actors and then opens it again. This makes MQTT actor unaware if we want to create brand new connection or update existing one. So it needs to be taken to upper level - ConnectionPersistenceActor, I guess.

Modifying of closed connection does not do any unsubscribe, apparently. So if we modify closed connection to closed one, we'll need to do unsubscribe on opening the connection.

Having that said, understanding if the MQTT client should unsubscribe (from some or all topics) or not does not seem a straightforward thing.

To be honest, I don't imagine how it would be intuitive to understand if we want just to close connection or close and discard saved session. Maybe we could introduce some header, e.g., ditto-mqtt-clear-session and process it when connection is being closed (for example, when processing CloseConnection or ModifyConnection commands), and not do unsubscribe anywhere else? I'm not fan of magic headers, but guessing if user wants to clear session seem to be complicated and prone to mistakes. Introducing new commands only for MQTT (like, CloseConnectionAndClear) does not seem reasonable to me.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85yDdHm/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It is intended that - when a imported policy is changed - all things using policies importing from that single policy are updated in the search index (to reflect the changed permissions).

It is however quite unexpected that e.g. the same policy `org.eclipse.ditto:my-root-policy` is loaded for all policies which use that exact same policy. But this seems to be the case:

See also [here](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/protocol-twinlive.html)

**Option 1: Use live channel: Send a message to the device (bypassing the twin) - device receives the message**

Example via HTTP API:
```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:4711/features/fan/inbox/messages/TURNOFF?timeout=0
```
This will generate the following ditto message:
```
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/4711/things/live/messages/TURNOFF"",
  ""headers"": {...},
  ""path"": ""/features/fan/inbox/messages/TURNOFF""
}
```

**Option 2: Use twin channel: Send a command to modify the twin - device receives a ""modified"" event**

Example via HTTP API:
```
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:4711/features/fan
```
with payload
```
{
  ""desiredProperties"": {
    ""state"": ""OFF""
  }
}
```
This will generate the following ditto message:
```
{
  ""topic"": ""org.eclipse.ditto/4711/things/twin/events/modified"",
  ""headers"": {...},
  ""path"": ""/features/fan"",
  ""value"": {
    ""desiredProperties"": {
      ""state"": ""OFF""
    }
  }
}
```

**Precondition**
Both options requires the device to subscribe to receive these messages. E.g. the device is connected to a MQTT broker and you have a ditto connection to this broker with a **target** like this:
```
{
      ""address"": ""eclipse-ditto-sandbox/command/{{ thing:id }}"",
      ""topics"": [
        ""_/_/things/twin/events"",
        ""_/_/things/live/messages""
      ],
      ""qos"": 0,
      ""authorizationContext"": [
        ""nginx:ditto""
      ],
      ""headerMapping"": {}
    }
```
And your device is subscribing like this:
```
mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -t eclipse-ditto-sandbox/command/org.eclipse.ditto:4711

A sample scenario is given below.

Sample data stored in Ditto:
```
{
  ""thingId"": ""sample.eclipse.com:test_1"",
  ""policyId"": ""sample.eclipse.com:policy-default"",
  ""attributes"": {
    ""a"": ""b""

    }
  }
}

API query to fetch only the array 'a' from the Ditto thing:
`/api/2/search/things?namespaces=sample.eclipse.com&fields=features/values/properties/a`

Response on Ditto 3.4.4: (Returns array with values for ""a"")
`{""items"":[{""features"":{""values"":{""properties"":{""a"":[1,2,3]}}}}],""nextPageOffset"":-1}`

Response on Ditto 3.5.1: (Returns an empty array for ""a"")
`{""items"":[{""features"": { ""values"": { ""properties"": { ""a"": [] }}}}],""nextPageOffset"": -1}`

However, if we were to update the fields query parameter in the request from `features/values/properties/a` to `features/values/properties`, we get the correct response - similar to what was observed in 3.4.4.

Looks like we have a bug for search/things API for arrays in 3.5.1 that needs to be fixed.

That version uses the bitnami `common` chart version `1.16.1`.

With bitnami `common` chart version `2.9.0`, there has been an incompatible change in the `common.labels.standard` named template.
This means, that when using the ditto chart together with another bitnami chart that uses the `common` chart >= 2.9 (e.g. the newest Kafka chart), there may be an error like
```

The above error is from testing the Eclipse IoT Packages cloud2edge chart with the upcoming Hono Helm chart version which references Kafka chart version 26.8.4 (see https://github.com/eclipse/packages/pull/523).

The solution here would be to update the mongoDB chart dependency in the ditto chart to at least `13.17.0` (or more generally `^13.x`, meaning `13.18.5`).

I have a specific case where I use following connection `topic _/_/things/twin/events?extraFields=features/{{feature:id}},thingId&filter=like(resource:path,'/features/SoftwareUpdate*')` to consume change notifications by stateless service, which are enriched for other contextual data from the same feature even in case of partial feature modification. Currently it happens in case of concurrent modify commands, that `extra` field contains different values than actual changes in `value` field (see screenshot).

Since ditto supports retrieving historical revisions, the proposal is to provide deterministic and strong consistency by not looking up the current state, but the state at the revision number of the processed event. However, in some other use cases it may be more efficient to keep the caching implementation.

Thank you.

Good to hear that the feature works for you.
And yes, what you observe is exactly how Ditto behaves:
The search index only contains the fields which you are able to **search** for - Ditto will however always return the complete Thing JSON, as this is not retrieved via the search index, but via the ""things"" service.

A service calls messages API with a correlation-id header valued. Ditto triggers an event on the device that is processed and a response is then generated through an event that is captured by the initial service. These events should all contain the same correlation-id header with the value arriving via API.

To configure this scenario, I understand, that I can configure header mappings on both surce and connection targets.
https://eclipse.dev/ditto/3.2/connectivity-header-mapping.html
https://eclipse.dev/ditto/3.2/basic-connections.html#source-header-mapping
https://eclipse.dev/ditto/3.2/basic-connections.html#target-header-mapping

The example given in the documentation reports the correlation-id header, but trying to provide the connection with this headermapping returns:
{""status"":400,""error"":""connectivity:connection.configuration.invalid"",""message"":""The placeholder 'header:correlation-id' could not be resolved."",""description"":""Some placeholders could not be resolved. Check the spelling of the placeholder and make sure all required headers are set.""}

Checking in the documentation, it appears that the header can be inserted and customized as desired.

MQTT 3.1.1 (which you use based on the connection config) does not support protocol level headers.
So what you define in the source: 
```

},
```

So this simply can not work with MQTT 3.1.1 - MQTT 5 does support ""user properties"" - and even a well defined ""Correlation Data"" which Ditto maps to the ""correlation-id"".","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C850m3H9/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

  Now I want to change the value of these three fields 'water-tank/properties/configuration/brewingTemp', 'water-tank/properties/status/temperature' and 'water-tank/properties/status/waterAmount' through the mqtt connections. To create connection what I have to give in incoming script?
Can anyone send the incomingScripts for this case?  ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1911/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

You need an incoming mapping script only for specific reasons like:
- you are not able to or willing to adapt the way your device sends MQTT data (e.g. device has already a MQTT interface)
- there are limitations that do not allow to use ditto protocol (like you need narrow binary encoding of your signals)

In that case you need an incoming script to map the device data to ditto protocol messages. But that mapping depends on the input format (topics and payloads sent by the device).

Otherwise, just use a standard [MQTT connection](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-protocol-bindings-mqtt5.html) type with a source that listens to a simple topic structure:
```
<environment>/telemetry/<deviceId>/
```
From the device publish a ditto message to that topic:
```

- you need to replace the deviceId with your deviceId
- you need a `-t` parameter in the mosquitto_pub command that corresponds to the topic that is configured in the connection source: `mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -t eclipse-ditto-sandbox/t/<your_deviceId> -D publish content-type application/vnd.eclipse.ditto+json <your_payload>`

Types of modifications:
* modify (HTTP PUT)
* merge (HTTP PATCH)
* delete (HTTP DELETE)

There can be one `condition` be specified for those commands with the following semantic:
* if the condition (defined as Ditto [RQL](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/basic-rql.html)) evaluates to `true`, then perform the command 
   * e.g. modify the thing/attribute/feature 
   * e.g. merge (patch) the thing

For the merge however, we encountered that it often is required to define for a single merge (containing e.g. changes to patch several features of the same thing) several conditions
* in order to be able to patch some parts of the thing based on the current value of other parts of the thing

To enable that, we suggest to enhance Ditto `condition`s for merge/PATCH commands (e.g. `MergeThing`) with a special `patch-condition`.  
The header/queryParam should be another one than `condition` to be able to also combine them - and would e.g. take a ""map"" of JsonPointers and RQL expressions.  

Ditto must then evaluate for each ""JsonPointer"" of the merge/patch if the provided RQL statement evaluates to `true` - and only then ""include"" it in the merge/patch, otherwise drop it from it.

Example syntax:
```
patch-condition=
{
  ""/features/deviceStatus/properties/dimensions/internal/severity"": ""ge(features/deviceStatus/properties/dimensions/internal/severity/cardinality,20)"",
  ""/attributes/location"": ""not(exists(attributes/location)""

* then I created the Thing (notice that you require another `:` in your filter `like(thingId,'org.eclipse.ditto:myThing:*')`:
```
PUT /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:myThing:123

```
PUT /api/2/things/org.eclipse.ditto:myThing:123/features/water-tank

Any payload:
```json
{

I tried to replicate the issue, but I wasn't able to. I use Ditto 3.5.4.

I basically did the same steps as you:

- created thing with lamp feature provided
- updated (with PUT) water-tank feature
- updated (with PUT) lamp feature

Before doing that I enabled logs for the connection and here is what I see in Ditto UI:
![2024-05-03-122852_912x454_scrot](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/assets/2970647/633834e1-7c88-4494-b09a-0a02f5e47802)
Creating thing and updating lamp feature provided series of events with types dispatched-filtered-mapped-published while updating water-tank feature produced only event of dispatched type, which is expected behavior.

Could you, please, provide following:

- Ditto version you use
- connection logs  
Please, enable connection logs, do the test and send the logs here. Logs can be enabled using [HTTP API](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#enable-connection-logs) or Ditto UI under ""Connections"" tab at the top.  
Logs can be viewed on Ditto UI as well, or requested using [HTTP API](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-manage-connections.html#retrieve-connection-logs). I believe, requesting them using HTTP API will be better here as UI does not show whole logs at once and JSON can be more easily checked.

When a ""modify"" event is received, the targets are evaluated in the signalFilter at [OutboundDispatchingActor.java#L103](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/f2b8dc077576f40eea85e889520cd422b1e08039/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/OutboundDispatchingActor.java#L103C9-L103C103). There the targets topics are evaluated as a whole so the modify event mathes the filter of the second topic and so the target is authorized.

Then the targets are split by having and not enrichment. So a pair is created with pair.second() only with the topic with extraFields  whitout evaluating its filter, not asuming that it will not match.  [OutboundMappingProcessorActor#splitTargetsByExtraFields#L852](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/f2b8dc077576f40eea85e889520cd422b1e08039/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/OutboundMappingProcessorActor.java#L852C1-L852C96) 

This leads for the message being droped later at [OutboundMappingProcessorActor#applyFilter](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/f2b8dc077576f40eea85e889520cd422b1e08039/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/OutboundMappingProcessorActor.java#L810)

Possible solutions.
 1. Evaluate again the extraFields topic filter in the filtering in [splitTargetsByExtraFields](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/f2b8dc077576f40eea85e889520cd422b1e08039/connectivity/service/src/main/java/org/eclipse/ditto/connectivity/service/messaging/OutboundMappingProcessorActor.java#L848C9-L849C9).

 2. Another would be to explicitly point out in the documentation that such mixing of same topics in a single target is not permited and even maybe extend the connection config validation before creating a connection but still i think that this is a bug.

My assumption of the functionality would be that if more than one topic with filters is configured in a connection then first in presedence would be the one with extraFields that has a matching filter (because only one call for retrieving is done and we wouldn't  want to multiply messages in one target) and then the others.

@thjaeckle i would like your input and thoughts on that. I was wondering if adding one more filter evaluation on each signal would not be the best approach but certenly is the smallest of a change in such a place.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1930/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I would however agree that this is useful to support (having the `_/_/things/twin/events` several times in the targets, but with different `filter` and `extraFields`).

I was thinking of  sending to the first matching topic in a target. If more match i would consider this a configuration  mistake. 
 
>* can there be optimizations for retrieving e.g. ""different"" extraFields for different matching targets?

From what i saw the enrichment is done once per topic in a target so i am not sure an optimisation would be necessary here. Considering that a target sends only one event, if multiple targets with matching topics are configured then they should be indipendent of one another.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C858SjGM/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Apparently, the command worked in different way for you. Probably, we use different kafka versions, and for your installation command line arguments should be different.

The implementation however seems to make some assumptions where this can be used.  
We found several places where this is not working, e.g.:

Won't work (as the ""featureId"" may not contain slashes which is validated in the `gateway`):
* could work via non-HTTP
```json
{
  ""features"": {
    ""{{ /.*/ }}"": null,
    ""two"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""bool"": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Won't work (as apparently the regex is not detected when not being included in the ""deepest nested"" JsonObject):
```json
{
  ""features"": {
    ""two"": {
      ""{{ /.*/ }}"": null,
      ""properties"": {
        ""bool"": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Won't work (as a feature property may also not contain slashes, validated in the gateway as well):
* could work via non-HTTP
```json
{
  ""features"": {
    ""two"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""{{ /.*/ }}"": null,
        ""bool"": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So the implementation of #1593 is currently unusable, we could even ""fix it"" by not requiring slashes `/<regex>/` in the approach - because that causes validation issues via HTTP ..","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1939/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So e.g. having admin users in a separated OpenID connect provider is not possible.

using the helm deployment on EKS I'm facing an issue: it seems I can't use the Nginx service in order to make api calls.
I'm installing Ditto with this command since I want to create a default ""ditto"" user and using the Nginx service to perform first api calls.

`helm install -n ditto my-ditto oci://registry-1.docker.io/eclipse/ditto --version 3.5.6 --set global.cluster.basicAuthUsers[0].user=ditto --set global.cluster.basicAuthUsers[0].password=ditto --set gateway.config.authentication.enablePreAuthentication=true`

After the installation, when I try to point to the Nginx and set basic authentication with ditto:ditto and perform an api call, I always get a ""401 not authenticated"" error. 
However, I can use the gateway microservice (adding the nginx:ditto user to x-ditto-pre-authenticated header) but this is not the preferred way we'd like to use. 
Can you please tell me what's wrong with this situation?  what am I missing?

You seem to use the wrong config key .. `basicAuthUsers` is not nested in `cluster`, but directly exposed under `global`.
This should work:
```

Use docker deployment a RabbitMQ,
Use the ip:192.168.74.128 port:5672 username:guest password:guest I can visit RabbitMQ.


But I don't know how to configure the (eclipse ditto) connection or service to connect the RabbitMQ.

Sending messages can e.g. be done via the HTTP API:

If you configured your connection for ""target"" ""topic"" ""_/_/things/live/messages"", your AMQP exchange/routingKey will receive all of the messages the configured ""authorizationContext"": [""ditto:outbound-auth-subject"", ""...""] is allowed to READ (based on the referenced policyId of the thing you sent the message to).

Each ditto service we use (policies, things, thingsSearch, gateway) has 2 instances, and a pod disruption budget of 1, so no service is ever gone completely.

Almost every time there is an update of the AKS and the nodes get recreated one after another, ditto does not correctly answer the requests anymore and returns status 500.

In the logs we see errors like this:
```
Received DittoRuntimeException during enforcement or forwarding to target actor, telling sender: DittoInternalErrorException [message='There was a rare case of an unexpected internal error.', errorCode=internalerror, httpStatus=HttpStatus [code=500, category=SERVER_ERROR], description='Please contact the service team or your administrator.'

Are you sure that the k8s pods are shutdown gracefully so that the JVM received a `SIGTERM` and can do a proper cluster shutdown?

E.g. the `things` service logs (on service update when the ""old"" version is stopped):
```
INFO Initiated coordinated shutdown; gracefully shutting down ...
...
(30-60 seconds later)
INFO Graceful shutdown completed.
```

On EKS I once had the issue that a k8s network policy was configured which immediately stopped all traffic to/from pods once they were stopped - so the leaving cluster node never got the chance to communicate to other cluster nodes that it now ""gracefully leaves"" the cluster.
That lead to similar situations which you described - and often in an inconsistent cluster state.

I have no recent experience with AKS - but on AWS EKS our Ditto updates currently run completely smooth (using the Helm chart), even with load on the cluster.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C85__LrI/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I checked the logs and I find `Initiated coordinated shutdown gracefully shutting down ...`

Sometimes it does not show the `Graceful shutdown completed.`

But the last recorded message seen about 5 seconds after the shutdown was started:
`thing: [68] of the entities in shard [0] not stopped after [5 seconds]. Maybe the handOffStopMessage [org.eclipse.ditto.internal.utils.cluster.StopShardedActor] is not handled?`

So it seems like the shutdown is not always graceful.

 **There is not so good choice in Java world for DTLS and TLS for IoT**.

  let contentType = 'application/json';

  return Ditto.buildExternalMsg(headers, textPayload, bytePayload, contentType);
}
```

I narrowed it down to the following setting of the connection:
```
""payloadMapping"": [
        ""javascript""
      ]
```

Without that setting it does not seem to work, repectivly it will send outgoing messages in plain ditto payload format.

I started my tests with the following example: https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto-examples/blob/master/mqtt-bidirectional/README.md#Payloadmapping

Here the ""payloadMapping"" setting does not seem to be present in the example. So I think it is not a problem of ditto, but perhaps of the documentation / example.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86BM5G2/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I'm trying to run Eclipse Ditto on Docker Swarm, initially, I was able to successfully run Ditto using the provided [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/master/deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml) file in Docker (not Swarm mode) without modifying the [nginx.conf](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/master/deployment/docker/nginx.conf) file.


I made some adjustments to the `docker-compose.yml` file to work in Docker Swarm :
* Commented out `restart: always`;
* Commented out `healthcheck` section; 
* Commented out `volumes` for the `swagger-ui` service, since volumes are not be suitable for Swarm, I will configure it later;
* Replaced `volumes` for the `nginx` service with `configs`, to mount nginx files;

I'm encountering an issue where the `nginx` service is not recongizing `gateway `service, here is its logs:
```

```
the **line 44** from `nginx.conf` file : 
```
39     ...

41    location /api/2/connections {
42      include nginx-cors.conf;

56    ...
```

and when I send request from Postman, ex : GET http://localhost:8080/api/2/things/ with ditto:ditto in Authorization, I get this as output :

I assume that Ditto will not run on docker swarm out of the box.
I used it 7 years ago or so and back then it required a special DNS based service discovery of the Ditto cluster nodes.

Why would you use docker swarm when just locally starting it on a windows machine?

That looks like a network issue, eg you use the external IP of the mosquito server instead of the (docker network) internal one.

Do you use docker compose?
Then you should be able to just use the service name as hostname, the Docker DNS should resolve that correctly in the Docker network.

- A device connects to an MQTT broker, and publishes its sampling rate

To calculate the timestamp of a message, we would need the registration time and the sampling rate. Is this possible using a javascript incoming payload mapper? I guess it is possible by publishing the entire state of the device to mqtt and reading it again, but this seems redundant.

I don't know what a WSO2 gateway is, but Ditto just needs to be able to download the TM referenced in a definition via this Http endpoint.
So this might even be a cluster internal endpoint, as long as Ditto is able to download via the cluster internal Http endpoint
. 
If it is a Https endpoint and has a valid, publicly trusted, certificate, Ditto will be able to download it (if no network rules prevent that Ditto calls outside URLs).

So e.g. mounting a custom truststore as Docker volume and adjusting the according system property to point to that location, see e.g.:
https://medium.com/@vishwanath.leo/how-to-pass-your-custom-truststore-as-argument-to-jvm-when-running-a-jar-file-f9e05adc5094

Also the connectivity logs are filled with this error message:
```

```
This message puzzles me as it looks like the connectivity services tries to connect on localhost while the Kafka broker is on another container.

My deployment uses the docker compose configuration in `deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml` to which I added a container with the Kafka broker as such:
```

How did you configure Kafka?
Because Ditto will contact the Kafka bootstrap server at `kafka` hostname - and the bootstrap server then responds with the actual hostnames / IPs to connect to.  
I assume that Kafka is configured to use hostname `localhost` as ""advertised listener"" - and responds with `localhost` - to which Ditto however can of course not connect.

You could however enable [""pre-authentication""](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/installation-operating.html#pre-authentication) and then e.g. configure your nginx (or other reverse proxy in front of Ditto) to always set a static header, for example:
```
proxy_set_header              x-ditto-pre-authenticated ""nginx:anonymous"";
```

Then you basically use a single user which is authenticated at all HTTP requests - and which will have access to all APIs, effectively bypassing authorization.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86FHB07/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I have set up JWT authentication and authorization in Ditto, but I am getting a `DittoHeadersTooLargeException` in the gateway service when passing along my JWT token. It seems that when adding the subjects to the DittoHeaders, the gateway service overflows the maximum allowed length for the headers. Is this max configurable? It does not seem to be the same as `pekko.http.server.parsing.max-header-value-length`. 

I also noticed in the logs that the JWT token is being set in Ditto headers. Is there a way to skip some headers like this? I would assume that the JWT token is not needed for internal communication between the services since the subjects are already calculated in the gateway service, am I wrong?

How do you deploy Ditto?
The `Authorization` header should be excluded from the ""header propagation"" in the Ditto Helm chart:
https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/8f48e9622ae7fb2de77905e08cc3c88a830fef81/deployment/helm/ditto/values.yaml#L1507

So there is a way to skip a list of defined headers (by configuration) from being propagated.
I would check which ones cause a lot of payload and exclude them, if not needed, same as the Helm chart config already does:
https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/8f48e9622ae7fb2de77905e08cc3c88a830fef81/deployment/helm/ditto/values.yaml#L1495-L1515

If you add a lot of subjects from the JWT as `authSubjects` to the DittoHeaders, the headers could also get too large.
There is also a configuration of a max. amount of auth subjects - if this is exceeded, the same exception is also thrown:
https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/8f48e9622ae7fb2de77905e08cc3c88a830fef81/edge/service/src/main/resources/ditto-edge-service.conf#L27-L29

You can also increase the max. possible size of the headers, which is by default 5k:
https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/blob/8f48e9622ae7fb2de77905e08cc3c88a830fef81/edge/service/src/main/resources/ditto-edge-service.conf#L23-L25","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86FRZb-/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am currently integrating Keycloak with Eclipse Ditto. Since granting user permissions is done elsewhere from ditto, my idea is to map specific resources and scopes as subjects in Ditto and use a user's RPT token as the input of this mapping. The RPT token, granted by keycloak, is a JWT token that contains some user's permissions. The structure is as follows: 

```
{
  ""authorization"": {
      ""permissions"": [
        {
          ""scopes"": [ ""device.read"" ],
          ""resource_set_id"": ""d2fe9843-6462-4bfc-baba-b5787bb6e0e7"",
          ""resource_set_name"": ""Device 1""
        },
        {
          ""scopes"": [ ""device.read"", ""device.write"" ],
          ""resource_set_id"": ""d2fe9843-6462-4bfc-baba-b5787bb6e0e7"",
          ""resource_set_name"": ""Device 12
        }
      ]
  },
  ""jti"": ""d6109a09-78fd-4998-bf89-95730dfd0892-1464906679405"",
  ""exp"": 1464906971,
  ""nbf"": 0,
  ""iat"": 1464906671,
  ""sub"": ""f1888f4d-5172-4359-be0c-af338505d86c"",
  ""typ"": ""kc_ett"",
  ""azp"": ""hello-world-authz-service""
}
```

my idea is to then, from this RPT, generate subjects:
- `d2fe9843-6462-4bfc-baba-b5787bb6e0e7#device.read`
- `d2fe9843-6462-4bfc-baba-b5787bb6e0e7#device.read`
- `d2fe9843-6462-4bfc-baba-b5787bb6e0e7#device.write`. 
With these subjects, a policy for a thing would include these subjects in the appropriate place (e.g. subject `d2fe9843-6462-4bfc-baba-b5787bb6e0e7#device.read` would be granted permission to read thing d2fe9843-6462-4bfc-baba-b5787bb6e0e7).

I have tried using jwt placeholders to convert the JWT token to the format I require, but I am not sure if it is possible. It seems that the supported json operations are very limited. For example, using the token structure above:
- JSON pointer indexing does not work (example: `authorization/permissions/0`)
- Can't do operations in nested objects. To reach something like `resource_set_id#scope`, I would have to do something like `{{ jwt:authorization/permissions | join(resource_set_id, scopes, '#') }}` (`join` function is merely ilustrative). The issue here is everything to the output of `jwt:claim` is acted on as a string and not as objects themselves.

Am I correct in assuming that the mapping I want is not currently possible using placeholders?

The JWT placeholder is quite mighty:
https://eclipse.dev/ditto/basic-placeholders.html#scope-openid-connect-configuration

It e.g. has a special handling for JSON arrays (and even JSON objects in arrays) - iterating over all entries and ""multiplying"" the result.

However, it seems we did not consider yet the ""array in array"" use case.
It also seems that only arrays in ""root level"" are currently supported .. I would say this is a bug, that should work also in nested structures.
I will create a ticket for that and can provide a fix.

What you however want to achieve is not yet supported, I fear .. selecting and combining fields only ""on the same level"".
But that is a very valid and useful use case. 👍 
We could track that as new issue, I am open for suggestions regarding syntax (probably a function as you suggested would be needed).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86FRuAT/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Is it currently possible to extract a property from a nested JSON object in an array without parsing the JSON object as a string? For example, using the structure from the RPT, is it possible to extract the `resource_set_id`as the authorization subjects?

I'm trying to integrate Eclipse Ditto with Eclipse Sparkplug, and I've been mostly successful in all the message types and flows:
- Javascript Payload mappers to decode protobuf messages
- Combining modify and merge protocol topics for birth or data messages
- Sending DCMD/NCMD commands using eclipse messages
- Conditional updates when sequence numbers are out of order (update only if incoming seq number is bigger that what is twin persisted)
- When a host application (a sparkplug host application is equivalent to an eclipse ditto connection), is started, a message to mqtt is sent declaring it is online, and when it closes, it sends a message informing it is closing. I've used connection announcements for this purpose. The payload of this message is the following:

```
{
   ""online"": boolean
   ""timestamp: milis since epoc - this timestamp is always the timestamp of when the connection is started, so a correlation betwen online/offline states can be made
}
```

 Only one small detail is missing to support Eclipse Sparkplug in this last point. When eclipse ditto ungracefully disconnects from the MQTT broker, a last will message should be sent with the status and the timestamp. Since the last will connection configuration is static, the timestamp cannot be rightfully set.

Does it make sense for Eclipse Ditto to support placeholders in the last will message? Also, the issue still remains that the timestamp should be the same as the last connection opened announcement. Could a connection-specific placeholder exist which holds the value of when the connection opens or closes?

It seems to me at least that an integration between these two projects is fruitful since they both act under the same domain and under the Eclipse umbrella.

Very interesting, would be nice to read about a finished Sparkplug integration at some point.

Hm, if I understood Mqtt last will correctly, providing a dynamic payload to it won't work.
I understood that a client defines this last will message eg after first connection. Then, when the broker detects that the client is gone, it will publish the (previously defined) last will message to subscribers.
So Ditto has no chance to provide a dynamic payload. 

I'm not an mqtt expert, but maybe the last will message could be refreshed/updated periodically, eg each minute?
This could be something Ditto could handle. ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86It5RD/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Yes you're right, the will message is sent along with the connect packet, which I assume happens before the ConnectionOpennedAnnouncement eclipse ditto message. So I guess that won't work... 

I guess a really dirty workaround (😄) would be to use an http push connection that listens to closed connection announcements and updates the last will message and javascript mappers with new timestamps.

For MQTT connections, you have special headers available to modify the MQTT topic of a `target`:
https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-protocol-bindings-mqtt.html#target-header-mapping
> * **mqtt.topic**: overwrites the topic configured for the target
> * **mqtt.qos**: overwrites the qos level configured for the target
> * **mqtt.retain**: controls whether the MQTT retain flag is set on the published message

This can be used in a custom provided [JavaScript payload mapper](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-mapping.html#javascript-mapping-engine) in order to modify both MQTT topic and payload to publish on that topic.

It is great that you show interest in reproducing the blog post. To be sure, are you talking about the post from: https://eclipse.dev/ditto/2024-02-27-integrating-ditto-aas-basyx.html ? 
As mentioned by @thjaeckle the nature of the blog post was to demonstrate what was possible at the time of writing. There is a chance that using a more recent version of any of the involved components might lead to breaking changes.
Which versions did you use for the involved components?

Could you please elaborate on what you did to get to the situation from the screenshots?
What do you want to achieve at the end of the day?

In your screenshot, it says that the status of the connection with the AAS registry is ""offline"". So it appears that there is either:

- a problem with the connectivity between the AAS Web UI and the AAS registry and AAS server
- a problem with the deployment of the AAS registry and AAS server

Can you make direct HTTP calls to the AAS registry or AAS server, e.g., through cURL, Swagger, etc., from the same machine from which you call the AAS WebUI?
In the blog post, there are some examples of how to interact with the AAS server and registry. Using and setting up the AAS Web-UI is more an addition to showing how the integration between Ditto and AAS worked. In case of more detailed questions about the AAS WebUI, it is better to get in contact with those developers.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86Ljn85/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So, I wanted to present an Interface in the Master Thesis for Eclipse Ditto using BaSyx, so I worked on your examples to implement the tree view of the Thing we create in Ditto but even with the default example in the Blog Post, I was not able to reproduce like what s been shown.

I can access and change the features and other points from the terminal and able to view in JSON format when looked in the browser under 
http://192.168.10.15:8082/aasServer/shells/ and for the registry as well, but like I have shown on the screenshot its showing ""Status: Offline"" even though the registry and server are connected.

The deployment of the AAS registry and Server is proper there s no issue with that, but I cannot view the submodels and the elements on GUI.

However, to achieve a truly automated setup, there are some missing configuration options, Connections and Policies.

Currently, after successfully setting up Ditto, Connections and Policies need to be configured via API call. This requires an extra tool that monitors Ditto and executes the necessary API calls after Ditto has started. 
Enabling the configuration of Connections and Policies within ConfigMaps would significantly simplify the deployment. Ditto could automatically read these resources and configure itself accordingly upon startup. This approach aligns with Kubernetes best practices and would streamline the deployment process.

I’m not on the development team, but here are a few thoughts. To implement such a feature, Ditto could be enhanced to process configurations provided by files in a designated folder, where ConfigMaps would be mounted.
This feature is probably also a benefit for classic server installations as well, allowing server administrators to pass the entire configuration at startup.

This however has the downside that a restart of the pod is required to react on updated configmaps / files.
Maybe a file (e.g. via inode) watch would also work to apply config changes without restart.

The benefit of the current approach is that policies/connections can be dynamically added, adjusted, etc. - without any impact to all other policies/connections.  
In my company's setup, we make use of a [terraform-provider-restapi](https://github.com/Mastercard/terraform-provider-restapi) in order to manage policies and connection. Terraform (or Terragrunt in our case) ""checks"" the resources via Ditto's HTTP API and updates them in-place (if necessary), creates or deletes them, if needed.

If you want to contribute that in a way which does not destroy the current dynamic way, we surely will accept the contribution. 
For our companies use-case I don't see much value, as we use connections and policies very dynamically - they are often changed, new ones come, old ones go, etc.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86SoiSW/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

For example, all `attributes` or a special `attribute` which is required for the event consumer to have a context.

This works and is great.  
However, this is also quite ""costly"" for Ditto - as the Gateway (for SSE and WebSocket) or Connectivity service of Ditto has to do another ""internal"" round-trip to fetch those `extraFields`. There are optimizations in place in order to cache them in a ""smart cache"" (which updates itself, etc.), but in the worst case, e.g. if the cache is full, this means a lot of roundtrips and networking.

There are scenarios when specific fields are always needed - that's why I suggest to configure (in the `things` service configuration) pre-defined `extraFields` which are pro-actively always sent in a DittoHeader field.  
When the Connection or WebSocket ""demands"" this extraField (and e.g. no other), it can just use it from this header without additional roundtrips.  
This should be configurable on a namespace level.

Example configuration:
```hocon
pre-defined-extra-fields = [

It would be even better to let Ditto automatically figure out

Ditto could e.g. track how often a `RetrieveThing` command (in scope of ""enrichment"" - which could be identifiable via an internal header) for specific fields of a namespace is done and automatically build up a cache of ""most frequently"" asked for fields.  
Then start to send them pro-actively as pre-defined extraFields (see #2072 for the fundamentals on that).

Reasoning of this is that e.g. connections have rather statically configured ""extraFields"" - and via connections Ditto most likely gets most of the ""extraFields"" enrichment requests. 
Sporadically, also WebSocket and SSE (Server Sent Event) may ask for `extraFields` - but this should not be much, so ideally such things would not be pro-actively added by the mechanism (to also not send too much stuff pro-actively).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/2099/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

E.g. in order for an engineer to be able to get the exact same information shown as a certain user.  
For that, it would be great if Ditto could allow certain users to ""impersonate"" certain other users.

I don't think it makes sense to add this to Ditto policies, but to statically configure this.

First ideas on how to configure and actually perform the ""impersonation"" follow in this issue.

## Configuration

This is a very delicate feature (regarding security) - when wrongly configured or applied, Ditto authorization can be bypassed.  
It is therefore important to be able to really strictly configure:
* which auth subjects (users/groups) are allowed to impersonate
* which auth subjects (users/groups) can be impersonated
* for which entities impersonation should work
   * things
   * policies (more delicate, as they control authorization)
   * connections (also delicate, as they could be used to tamper with data or publish data to the outside)
* additional rules for impersonation
   * limiting it to certain namespaces (for things + policies)
   * limiting it to certain permissions (READ / WRITE)
   * e.g. presence of other HTTP headers (to be injected e.g. via infrastructure to provide another ""factor"" - thinking of MFA)
   * integration with OTP mechanisms? 

## Do the impersonation

* this has to be possible for all Ditto HTTP / Websocket / SSE APIs
* the APIs have to be usable as they normally would
* that leads to the suggestion to impersonate using HTTP headers
   * e.g.: `impersonate-as: ""[\""some-idp:some-sub\"",\""some-idp:some-group\""]""`","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/2101/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The destination could be defined in a target of a separate (maybe dedicated) connection, in which the address and header mapping configuration of responses should be placed.

Implementation proposal:
In OutboundMappingProcessorActor of the source connection, the outbound messages (responses) could be diverted (or not, depending on the source configuration) to the target connection OutboundMappingProcessorActor by sending a pubSub message at a specialized for this purpose topic. OutboundMappingProcessorActor of the target connection should be subscribed to listen to messages on this topic and continue the flow with received messages.

Would you like to configure the `connectionId` then in the connection which should re-route the responses?
And as well a `target` (address?) of the connection to deliver responses to?

When implementing this, the approach must be really well thought through ..
E.g. in order to preserve and guarantee message order in case a connection is scaled > 1 ""clients"", the pub/sub would also have to apply a sharding based on e.g. `thingId` in order to always send messages responses for a thing ""A"" via the same connectivity instance.

Currently (as far as I remember) the responses are sent via Pekko to the original `sender` of a message (the original ActorRef is transported and preserved across the whole cluster).  
For another sender than the actual sender to get the response instead, one could either:
* send back to the original sender first, then publish to another connection (simple, but inefficient - needs very likely another ""hop"" in the cluster for each response to deliver to another connection)
* inject ""target connection to receive response"" as `sender` of the Pekko message ","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBTx7C86cR7es/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The connectionId of the rerouting connection maybe can be configured in the source connection as a header mapping.

I’m trying to use the ""Update Twin with Live Response"" Mapper to update a thing’s features directly from live device metrics but find the documentation [here](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/connectivity-mapping.html#updatetwinwithliveresponse-mapper) limited.

Can you provide:

1. Example connection setup with this mapper (e.g., MQTT/Kafka)
2. Sample payload & mapping to update a twin from live device data (e.g., temperature, power level)?
Would appreciate a complete example. Thanks!","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/2107/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is problematic as the Connection loggers are only meant to be activated temporarily when debugging or developing connections or payload mappers.
