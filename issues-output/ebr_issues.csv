I would see the following benefits:

1. user do not need to build the plugin itself before starting to use ebr
2. because its integrated in the usual release cycle no incompatibilities with newer tycho version (or at least they will be discovered very early)
3. tighter integration possible, currently its a two-step-process we should check how this can be integrated more smooth to make this work in one go.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-orbit/ebr/issues/45/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Most of the time that only requires metadata. Occasionally it may require Java code (eg., an activator, providing/integrating with services/class loading). The EBR Maven plug-ins support that, i.e. it's possible to patch/override/replace code of legacy jars. Additionally, it's possible to combine multiple jars into one (""all-in-one"") or producing only a subset of a jar (eg., to remove IP issues).

However, nothing at EBR mandates to use a specific technology. If Tycho provides the same functionality we can start using that and don't need our own plug-ins. 

Ultimately, I would love to see everything running in a single refactor and being used interchangeably. The deep integration with Tycho is possible. We have a a plug-in stub for extending Tycho.

We are not too far, though. I believe the remaining issue is to refactor Tycho's target platform resolution into a later phase, which allows arbitrary projects to produce OSGi artifacts for Tycho to resolve.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-orbit/ebr/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTk3NzQ4Ng==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thats why I think it might be good to port that ""maven-plugin-part"" (not EBR as a whole(!)) to tycho as at least this part where specific to tycho-technology.

I'm currently investigation (if there is some free time) the part of target platform resolution and the ebr plugin seems a good example and thus the idea to maybe first port it to be part of tycho itself :-)

If there is an artifact with OSGi metadata already then there are two options:

I agree with @guw here, consuming existing OSGi bundles as-is from external repos is not something for EBR to care about, Tycho can do it, PDE can do it (thanks to @laeubi 's work).
We could imagine a separate utility to amend existing OSGi jars (add signatures and consequently change Bundle-SymbolicName & Bundle-Vendor). As this could be a relatively standard case, we may be able to achieve that without a `osgi.bnd` file, by implementing a simple utility that can take of that; so it could be easily reused in any context.
However, it's maybe worth calculating whether just adding signatures upstream would be profitable. Or, if basically just getting rid of constraints over signatures of external jars would be a good idea (since who really verifies the binaries anyway before running OBR or Tycho?).","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-orbit/ebr/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODQ4NjI4MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I'm not suggesting that. It's still valueable to have the bundle in Orbit and shared for multiple projects.

If - however - the artifact is consumed directly from an external source it should *not* be signed. We have no control of the other source and it may change randomly.

I would be fine with retaining an osgi.bnd for the sake of Bundle-SymbolicName, but then could there at least be a way to not have Import/Export-Package re-calculated ? I believe they still get re-generated even when present in the artifact manifest.

FWIW, the EBR plug-in is configured in the parent pom.xml for recipes. Did you play with the configuration? It might be possible to avoid the osgi.bnd file.

Under the hood EBR ist just the Apache Felix Maven Bundle plug-in with some conventions applied.
http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html

I don't know if bnd has an operation mode to re-use existing headers. The point of bnd is to generate the headers. Thus, I think the easier path might be to enhance the create-recipe mojo to look into an existing manifest and copy the headers into the osgi.bnd file.

From some local testing, I'm having some success by adding the manifest (if `${project.build.directory}/dependency-bin/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` exists) to the `<_include>..</_include>` header. It can probably be overridden by individual bundle recipes as needed.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-orbit/ebr/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODg0NjEzNQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The JDK upgrade to 11 is already planned for the next major version. We can test it with 1.2.0, however, if I remember correctly, that had some issue. Is it possible to release 1.3 with an older Tycho version and start with a 1.4 with an upgraded version?
It’ll help us massively to also manage the backport of critical bug fixes if required.
