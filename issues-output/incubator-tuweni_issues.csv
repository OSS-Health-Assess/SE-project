1. a unit32 with the size of the list
2. a sequence of Bytes each one encoding a bit in the list. 

This is according to the implementation
https://github.com/apache/incubator-tuweni/blob/03c08eeeba108670938252fef1fee209bdf435fe/ssz/src/main/java/org/apache/tuweni/ssz/SSZ.java#L1221

If this is correct, it does not seem to correctly implement the format of the Eth2.0 spec https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/ssz/simple-serialize.md#bitlistn

which specifies that the bits should be put together in Bytes (which seems to a good idea as produces more compact encodings).

Is that going to be problem when communicating with clients that do implement the spec?

yes, the spec. isn't even agreed to as a standard in ethereum foundation, which `chain_id` and `network_id` having different meanings, but let's just ignore that for this argument. 

I think a good place to start would be with something like this: https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains where a network's metadata is at least indexed and agreed upon. Defining those terms first then worrying about specific parts such as `alloc` for example would be easier, as the amount of configuration is rather large when you start getting into IBFT2, etc. 

Another good reference point would be the Parity config generator: https://paritytech.github.io/parity-config-generator/#config=e30=

**Motivation**
The current peer-to-peer networking does not allow hot restarts of Ethereum clients.

We want to implement just enough logic we can keep connections open with existing peers, while we have the ability to create controller/worker or controller/controller replication schemes.

* Implement ETH proxy to capture and replay most important messages - status, in particular.

Motivation
DNS is the most performant distributed system in the world. Right now, p2p systems use direct UDP connections to transmit metadata information to perform discovery.

By relying on DNS, the systems become more reliable, less open to eclipse attacks. This requires trusting the authority which updated the DNS record, and to know which DNS record to look up for. This can be considered an acceptable tradeoff.

Scope of work
Implement reading the ENRs from a DNS record.

Implement keeping up to date with DNS to update when the tree is modified.

Implement writing a set of DNS TXT records according to the logic.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-tuweni/issues/59/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This blake2b compression is implemented by Sodium, but Ethereum chose to use a different sigma.

**Motivation**
Current implementations of blake2b are client-specific - there exists one for each client, so far. They also are implemented in Java where ideally they should be implemented in low-level C, and introduced via bindings.

Finally, this could be easily done by adopting and extending the libsodium primitives.

We get this org.apache.tuweni.toml.TomlInvalidTypeException: Value of 'plugin-kafka-log-filter-topics' is a array

This mean the following config does not work:
```

This gets expensive when you perform a lot of small allocations quickly. A better way might be to approach a large direct buffer and allocate portions of it to smaller bytes objects.

Offer options to use:
* Direct
* Heap
* File

The more correct usage then would be: `Bytes.wrapByteBuf(buffer, buffer.readerIndex(), buffer.readableBytes())` 

> I’d say the expected output is 100. A byte buffer is not variably sized, but rather sized at creation. Its content is 100 bytes. You just have 99 that are undefined.

I would tend to disagree here: 

```java
    ByteBuf buf = Unpooled.buffer().writeByte(1);
    Bytes bytes = Bytes.wrapByteBuf(buf);
    System.out.println(bytes.size());
```

This would output `256`. If you write `300` bytes, the output would be `512`. The buffer size is not static and managed internally. Another Netty version may potentially allocate other buffer size by default which makes `Bytes.wrapByteBuf()` behavior inconsistent. 

Just another sample: that would output `1`
```java
    ByteBuf buf = Unpooled.buffer().writeByte(1);
    ByteBuf wBuf = Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(buf);
    Bytes bytes = Bytes.wrapByteBuf(wBuf);
    System.out.println(bytes.size());
```

The 'true' `ByteBuf` content starts at `readerIndex` and has size `readableBytes`. While other buffer content is still available via `ByteBuf` API it should be treated as junk. When allocating buf via `Unpooled.directBuffer()` you may even potentially have uninitialized memory in the rest of the buffer. 

I see the option of `Bytes.wrapByteBuf(ByteBuf, int, int)` but I still think the method `Bytes.wrapByteBuf(ByteBuf)` default behavior should be to wrap only the readable content of `ByteBuf`. 

I would reopen the issue for the next round of discussions","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-tuweni/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzQ4MjM4OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It contains pointers for readable and writable pointers and provides a method `Unpooled.buffer()` that provides a buffer who's capacity may vary between implementations and doesn't guarantee bytes are zeroed out. These are not features of the `Bytes` implementation in Tuweni.

Given Netty provides methods to present just the ""readable"" bytes as a `ByteBuf`, e.g. `Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(byteBuf)`, I'm not sure the implementation of `Bytes.wrapByteBuffer(...)` is definitively wrong or needs to be changed, as you have the option to achieve what you're looking for via `Bytes.wrapByteBuffer(Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(...))`. That said, I'm sure @atoulme would also happily consider an alternative constructor method that inlines this behavior.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-tuweni/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzY4NzE5NQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

And this is exactly the reason why I would expect from `Bytes` to wrap only readable `ByteBuf` content

> Given Netty provides methods to present just the ""readable"" bytes as a ByteBuf, e.g. `Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(byteBuf)`

`Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(byteBuf)` is actually was just an example. It is normally used to 'concat' several `ButeBuf`s. And it concats only readable bytes. 

It is absolutely regular use case for Netty to receive a wire frame in a `ByteBuf` e.g. `| header | payload |` and then a lower-level decoder reads the `| header |` and then passes the same `ByteBuf` to a higher-level decoder with a `readerIndex` positioned to the beginning of  `| payload |` and the higher-level decoder treat that `ByteBuf` exactly as just only `| payload |`. 
So in that case I would expect `Bytes.wrapByteBuf()` to return only payload bytes.

You may also check Google results on [""netty bytebuf to array""](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=netty+bytebuf+to+array)

If you think the existing behavior is the one which is expected (or may be already relied on by other libs), I would add a Javadoc comment and and an alternative method which wraps the `ByteBuf` readable contents only.

Hey, I would still suggest to address this issue in one or another way. It's definitely not a showstopper, but I'm pretty sure there would definitely be misreading and erroneous usage of this method in the future.

The packaging listed in the pom looks wrong, it's listed as `pom` and it likely should be `jar` (or not defined)
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/tuweni/tuweni-bytes/1.1.0/tuweni-bytes-1.1.0.pom

This is minor, but... the ""name"" field is wrong in the project poms, this field is commonly used in reports. for example usage of the `maven-notice-plugin` uses the name field.  The ""name"" `tuweni-bytes` is now `task ':bytes:jar' property 'archiveBaseName'`

Generated output diff example from the `maven-notice-plugin`:
```diff

```
2021-11-11 13:16:07.530+00:00 | Timer-0 | WARN  | DNSResolver | I/O exception contacting remote DNS server /8.8.8.8:53
java.io.EOFException

        at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)
```

After investigating the code a little bit I noticed that the code in `DNSResolver` 
* does not rate limit calls
* does not handle the exception sensibly - ignoring the subtree of the merkle tree where the failure happened
* swallows the domain name and prints a warning without even telling what domain name failed

When i tried to debug the issue it seemed that waiting some time before requests allowed me to retrieve all the data properly so I suspect the DNS just returned an empty response from time to time when it got hammered with requests.

It's correct according to this test case but I'm not convinced the test case is correct:

I would also argue that trimLeadingZeros should also return ""0x0"" for 0 since zero isn't a _leading_ zero.

I came across this for UInt64 but may apply to other datatypes. 

Please could I get confirmation if this is a bug or not?

That's fair and I can see how toShortHexString might have different requirements depending on if you want to serialize to RLP or JSON.

I would still argue trimLeadingZeros is either a misleading name or behaviour. Maybe it makes sense for the RLP scenario, but it could be more explicit about it in the name as for me that was unexpected behaviour.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-tuweni/issues/comments/IC_kwDOCqMbuc5O3Jzn/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"
